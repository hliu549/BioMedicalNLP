Most of the meiotic segregation studies of human Robertsonian translocations have been performed on common t(13;14) and t(14;21) translocations. Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common chromosomal rearrangements in humans. ROBs are whole-arm rearrangements between the acrocentric chromosomes 13-15, 21, and 22. ROBs can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations). Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common rearrangements in humans, contributing significantly to genetic imbalance, fetal wastage, mental retardation and birth defects. Rob(14q21q) and rob(13q14q), which are formed predominantly during female meiosis, comprise the majority (approximately 85%) of all ROBs. Previous studies have shown that the breakpoints are consistently located within specific regions of the proximal short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 21. To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q). Chromosome 22, most probably, is the only chromosome where chAB4 is found in the direct neighbourhood of the centromere. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of metaphase chromosomes of carriers of rob(21q22q) revealed breakpoint diversity for this rare type of Robertsonian translocation chromosome. This process is suggested for the evolution of an alpha satellite subfamily recently found on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations.The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes.Homologous alpha satellite sequences on human acrocentric chromosomes with selectivity for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21: implications for recombination between nonhomologues and Robertsonian translocations.Out of 21 structural chromosomal anomalies and polymorphic variants, six deletions and microdeletions, four situations with abnormal long \"p\" arm of acrocentric chromosomes, two duplications, two reciprocal translocations, two inversions, two additions, one Robertsonian translocation associating trisomy 13, one 9q heteromorphism and one complex chromosome rearrangement were noticedThe purpose of this study was to search for cytologic evidence of robertsonian translocation formation that involves chromosomes 14q and 21q in human oogenesis with the use of dual color fluorescent in situ hybridization with whole chromosome paints.The oocytes from a chromosomally normal fetus at 23.5 weeks of gestation underwent cohybridization with chromosome specific DNA libraries from chromosomes 14 and 21The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomesHomologous alpha satellite sequences on human acrocentric chromosomes with selectivity for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21: implications for recombination between nonhomologues and Robertsonian translocations.The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes.", "answers": {"answer_start": [33, 383, 2293, 396, 36], "text": ["13", "14", "15", "21", "22"]}}

This report describes a three-generation family with a severe phenotype of long-QT syndrome-1 (LQTS-1) caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the KQT-like, voltage-gated potassium channel-1 gene (KCNQ1; MIM 607542).Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, account for the most common form of LQTS, LQTS1. Nine patients were diagnosed with LQT1 and nine with LQT2. The other six individuals were healthy, with no symptoms characteristic for prolonged QT syndrome, but came from families with confirmed disease occurrence. The study was conducted on members of four families. In order to search for mutations (using mSSCP and sequencing), genomic DNA was obtained from patients to determine the expression levels of the genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (HERG), involved in the occurrence of clinical signs of disease.Diagnosis of RWS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or molecular genetic testing of the genes known to be associated with RWS, of which KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), KCNH2 (locus name LQT2) and SCN5A (locus name LQT3) are the most common. Other, less frequently involved genes are KCNE1 (locus name LQT5), KCNE2 (locus name LQT6), CAV3 (locus name LQT9), SCN4B (locus name LQT10), AKAP9 (locus name LQT11), SNTA1 (locus name LQT12) and KCNJ5 (locus name LQT13).Type-1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1) is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition. Mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS.Genetic studies have identified mutations in six ion channel genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 and the accessory protein Ankyrin-B gene, to be responsible for this disorder. Seven family members were carriers of two amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1. KCNQ1 (formerly called KVLQT1) is a Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel gene responsible for the LQT1 sub-type of LQTS.Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2.It usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome). The primary defect in LQT1 is a mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+ channel. Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (LQTS) that predisposes affected individuals to sudden death from tachyarrhythmias. We investigated the molecular basis of LQTS in a Taiwanese kindred. Clinical and genetic analyses revealed that a mutation was linked to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG).We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9)The cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is also mutated in some Romano-Ward cases to produce defects in INa, the cardiac inward Na+ current. These findings provide the first evidence for a recessive form of the Romano-Ward long-QT syndrome and indicate that homozygous mutations on KVLQT1 do not invariably produce the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.

Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives.Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction affecting 20% to 30% of men worldwideTreatment of PE typically involves pharmacotherapy, particularly when lifelong.

Although fluoxetine remained the most commonly prescribed, other SSRIs were increasingly prescribed through 2002. These trends raise concerns regarding the widespread off-label use of antidepressants lacking reliable evidence of safety and efficacy for use in children and adolescents.Given the presumed efficacy of these new compounds and the off-label use of the current SSRIs, one might conclude that psychotherapy\\behavior therapy for rapid ejaculation is an obsolete and antiquated interventionThe use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and breast-feeding:The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not promoted because of lack of safety documentation. However, the off-label use of these drugs has been common for several years. In the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often preferred over tricyclic antidepressants because of their relatively few adverse effects and safety in overdose.

While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family.Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays.AUX/IAA proteins are active repressors, and

tomato solanum lycopersicum a reference species for solanaceae plants and the model plant for fleshy fruit development functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato aux iaa proteins function as active repressors of auxin dependent gene transcription with however different aux iaa members displaying varying levels of repression phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aux iaa gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with arabidopsis with a lower representation of non canonical proteins sl iaa genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene suggesting that aux iaas may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways the data presented here shed more light on sl iaa genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross talk.the aux iaa genes encode a large family of short lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants functional characterization of sliaa15 a member of the tomato solanum lycopersicum aux iaa family shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin dependent transcription the physiological significance of sliaa15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach revealing that sliaa15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes the sliaa15 down regulated lines display lower trichome number reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set moreover the leaves of sliaa15 inhibited plants are dark green and thick with larger pavement cells longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells the sliaa15 suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type i v and vi trichome formation suggesting that auxin dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation concomitant with reduced trichome formation the expression of some r2r3 myb genes putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation is altered these phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for aux iaas in plant developmental processes clearly indicating that members of the aux iaa gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific

will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b rapa.the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development this largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression the aux iaa genes are best characterized among the early auxin responsive genes which encode short lived transcriptional repressors in most plants examined including arabidopsis soybean and rice the aux iaa genes constitute a large gene family by screening the available databases at least 15 expressed sequence tags ests have been identified from wheat triticum aestivum which exhibit high sequence identity with aux iaa homologues in other species one of these aux iaa genes taiaa1 harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the aux iaa proteins has been characterized in detail the expression of taiaa1 is light sensitive tissue specific and is induced within 15 30 min of exogenous auxin application also the taiaa1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation ca 2 and this effect is reversed by the calcium chelating agent egta the taiaa1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide in addition to auxin the taiaa1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development.auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development the auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa genes encode short lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the transport inhibitor response1 auxin receptor f box proteins the aux iaa proteins regulate auxin mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the auxin response factor protein family aux iaa function is poorly understood herein we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 aux iaa family members the mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type double or triple mutants of closely related aux iaa genes such as iaa8 1 iaa9 1 or iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 also exhibit wild type phenotypes global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin treated and untreated light grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17 6 and iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 mutants by contrast similar analysis with the gain of function axr3 1 iaa17 1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin induced gene expression compared with the wild type expression of several type a arabidopsis response regulator genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3 1 iaa17 1 the data suggest extensive functional redundancy among aux iaa gene family members and that enhanced stability of the axr3 iaa17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype resulting in developmental defects.the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes.recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.", "answers": {"answer_start": [550, 550, 1266, 1266, 638, 882, 895, 904, 908], "text": ["IAA6", "IAA6", "IAA9", "IAA9", "IAA4", "SHY2/IAA3", "IAA3", "BDL/IAA12", "IAA12"]}}

The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditionsa novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methodsWe developed a novel PTM refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs in the input data. The use of this new modeling approach enables iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictionsWe develop an algorithm for identifying protein complexes by considering these two types of complexes separately. We test our algorithm on a few yeast protein interaction networks, and show that our algorithm is able to identify complexes more accurately than existing algorithms. A software program NDComplexStudying protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the structure-functionality relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in PPI networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in PPI networksIdentification of protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is the first step in understanding the organization and dynamics of cell function.We have developed an algorithm PROCOMOSS (Protein Complex Detection using Multi-objective Evolutionary Approach based on Semantic Similarity) for partitioning the whole PPI network into clusters, which serve as predicted protein complexes.With the exponentially growing amount of protein sequence data, an exploration of new methods that predict protein interaction sites based solely on sequence information is becoming increasingly urgentThis paper describes a new method that predicts interaction sites based on protein sequences by integrating five different algorithms employing meta-method, Majority Vote and SVMhmm Regression techniquesThe 'metaPIS' web-server was implemented for meta-prediction.

HKC mainly uses the concepts of highest k-core and cohesion to predict protein complexes by identifying overlapping clusters.

In the cluster expansion, all the proteins within the cluster have equal influences on determination of newly added protein to the cluster. In this paper, we extend the RRW algorithm by introducing a random walk with restarts with a cluster of proteins, each of which is weighted by the sum of the strengths of supporting evidence for the direct physical interactions involving the protein. The resulting algorithm is called NWE (Node-Weighted Expansion of clusters of proteins).

This peptide directly interacts with polymerase associated factor complex (PAF1c) and inhibits the transcriptional elongation of multiple oncogenes. The expression of this peptide and its corresponding circRNA are decreased in glioblastoma compared with the levels in normal tissues. Our results establish the existence of peptides encoded by circRNAs and demonstrate their potential functions in glioblastoma tumorigenesis.Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and polygenic disease that can be divided into different molecular subtypes based on histological and genomic features. To date, numerous susceptibility loci of breast cancer have been discovered by genome-wide association studies and may expand the genetic features. However, few loci have been further studied according to molecular subtypes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 23 recently discovered single nucleotide polymorphisms using the Sequenom iPLEX platform in a female Chinese cohort of 3,036 breast cancer patients (2,935 samples matched molecular subtypes) and 3,036 healthy controls.RESULTS: Through a stratification analysis, 5q11.2/MAP3K1 (rs16886034, rs16886364, rs16886397, rs1017226, rs16886448) and 7q32.3/LINC-PINT (rs4593472) were associated with Luminal A, and 10q26.1/FGFR2 (rs35054928) was associated with Luminal B.Plasma and tumor levels of Linc-pint are diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, p53 induced transcript (Linc-pint) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates tumor cell viability and proliferation. We used qRT-PCR and RNA FISH analysis to evaluate Linc-pint levels in the plasma and tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer (PCa) patients. Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Our data also show that Linc-pint levels are lower in PCa tumors than in adjacent tissues, carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (CAV) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and suggest that Linc-pint could be used for distinguishing the cause of malignant obstructive jaundice. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy. These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis.", "answers": {"answer_start": [99, 753, 1710], "text": ["Glioblastoma", "Breast cancer", "Pancreatic cancer"]}}

We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits.

Two compounds, BIX-01294 and its derivative TM2-115, inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 parasites in culture with IC(50) values of ~100 nM, values at least 22-fold more potent than their apparent IC(50) toward two human cell lines and one mouse cell line.Together, these results suggest that BIX-01294 and TM2-115 inhibit malaria parasite histone methyltransferases, resulting in rapid and irreversible parasite death.Synthesis and structure-activity relationship investigation of adenosine-containing inhibitors of histone methyltransferase DOT1L.A total of 55 adenosine-containing compounds were designed and synthesized, among which several potent DOT1L inhibitors were identified with K(i) values as low as 0.5 nM.Several new reagents and assays were developed to aid in the identification of EZH2 inhibitors, and these were used to execute two high-throughput screening campaigns.Of the five histone methyltransferases known to mediate methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9), euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2; also known as G9a) has been shown to be a primary mediator of H3K9 dimethylation; BIX-01294 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of EHMT2We hypothesised that inhibition of EHMT2 by BIX-01294 would result in reduced levels of H3K9 dimethylation and compromised embryo development.We also demonstrate that peptides that mimic SET1 family Win motif sequences inhibit H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex with varying degrees of efficiency.Studies of H3K4me3 demethylation by KDM5B/Jarid1B/PLU1 reveals strong substrate recognition in vitro and identifies 2,4-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid as an in vitro and in cell inhibitor.Inhibition studies of ccKDM5B showed both in vitro and in cell inhibition of ccKDM5B by 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) with a potency similar to that reported for the HDM KDM4C.Treatment with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an inhibitor of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, significantly enhanced the BZLF1 transcription in Raji cells when in combination with an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA).All assays allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors.

These proteins all associate with CCR4-associated factor 1 (Caf1), which belongs to the ribonuclease D (RNase D) family of deadenylases and is a component of the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex.The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA.CCR4, an evolutionarily conserved member of the CCR4-NOT complex, is the main cytoplasmic deadenylase. It contains a C-terminal nuclease domain with homology to the endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family of enzymes.The yeast Pop2 protein, belonging to the eukaryotic Caf1 family, is required for mRNA deadenylation in vivo.Although CAF1 protein belongs to the DEDDh family of RNases, CCR4 appears to be the principle deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex.Like CCR4, increased length of RNA substrates converted mCAF1 into a processive enzyme. In contrast to two other DEDD family members, PAN2 and PARN, mCAF1 was not activated either by PAB1 or capped RNA substrates.The domain has the fold of the DnaQ family and represents the first structure of an RNase from the DEDD superfamily.The evolutionarily conserved CCR4 protein, which is part of the cytoplasmic deadenylase, contains a C-terminal domain that displays homology to an Mg2+-dependent DNase/phosphatase family of proteins.These results establish that CCR4 and most probably other members of a widely distributed CCR4-like family of proteins constitute a novel class of RNA-DNA exonucleases.Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product.Shortening and removal of the 3' poly(A) tail of mature mRNA by poly(A)-specific 3' exonucleases (deadenylases) is the initial and often rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation.PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1158, 61, 1520, 811, 2420, 2434], "text": ["POP2", "PARN", "PAN2", "CCR4", "Nocturnin", "ANGEL"]}}

Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been recently classified into five distinct entities, each with different major pathophysiologic mechanisms. CRS type 1 most commonly occurs in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure where approximately 25% of patients develop a rise in serum creatinine and a reduction of urine output after the first several doses of intravenous diuretics. CRS type 2 is the hastened progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of chronic heart failure. CRS type 3 is acutely decompensated heart failure after acute kidney injury from inflammatory, toxic, or ischemic insults. CRS type 4 is manifested by the acceleration of the progression of chronic heart failure in the setting of CKD. Cardiac myocyte dysfunction and fibrosis, so-called 'CKD cardiomyopathy', is believed to be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism. Type 5 CRS is simultaneous acute cardiac and renal injury in the setting of an overwhelming systemic insult such as sepsis.

Despite numerous molecular and biological studies during the past three decades, the chemotherapeutic regimen remains unchanged. This vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) regime, described in Kilman, et al. (1973) and Koop, et al. (1963), has achieved limited success in controlling the progression of RMS. After the induction chemotherapy consisting of alternating vincristine, adriablastin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) and etoposide, ifosfamide with mesna protection (IE), a local treatment modality was chosen based on tumor and patient characteristics.Induction chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of 'VAC': vincristine (V), doxorubicin (A), cyclophosphamide (C) alternated with one cycle of 'VIAc': V, ifosfamide (I), actinomycin (Ac). Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy.Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy.

VAC (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide) regimens with anthracyclines resulted in better survival. Presence of distant metastases, large primary tumors, and pelvic localization were related to poor prognosis.The effective treatment for sarcoma botryoides is wide excision with safe margin of 1-2 cm, followed by 6-12 cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) regiment as an adjuvant chemotherapy.

Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis.

First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) has antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The ventral striatum, including the head of the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens, is a putative target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depression (MD). High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas.We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory major depression. Functional inhibition of the lateral habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties.Because a prominent clinical feature of depression is anhedonia--the inability to experience pleasure from previously pleasurable activities--and because there is clear evidence of dysfunctions of the reward system in depression, DBS to the nucleus accumbens might offer a new possibility to target depressive symptomatology in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.These preliminary findings suggest that DBS to the nucleus accumbens might be a hypothesis-guided approach for refractory major depression.Deep brain stimulation of the ventral caudate nucleus markedly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety until their remission, which was achieved at 6 months after the start of stimulation (HDRS < or = 7 and HARS < or = 10).No neuropsychological deterioration was observed, indicating that DBS of the ventral caudate nucleus could be a promising strategy in the treatment of refractory cases of both OCD and major depression.Comparisons of clinical outcomes and anatomical data on electrode positioning showed that caudate nucleus stimulation preferentially alleviated OCD manifestations, whereas nucleus accumbens stimulation improved depressive symptoms.

{"id": "54cf705ff693c3b16b000014", "question": "List receptors of the drug Cilengitide", "context": "Cilengitide inhibits attachment and invasion of malignant pleural mesothelioma cells through antagonism of integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25.Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide, an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development.As there is evidence for expression of the integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin \u03b1v heterodimer with high specificity for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25.Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy. Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin receptors.RESULTS: \u03b1v\u03b25 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas \u03b1v\u03b23 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 \u03bcg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines. UW479 cells expressed only \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on \u03b1v\u03b23 inhibition.Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on \u03b1v\u03b23 expression and sensitivity to anoikis. METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8). The \u03b1V\u03b23/\u03b1V\u03b25 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model.Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.  Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, and \u03b15\u03b21 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence. Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma.The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the \u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 3 and \u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases. We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) and \u03b1(v)\u03b2(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA. AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting \u03b1v\u03b2(3)/\u03b1(v) \u03b2(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of \u03b1v\u03b2(3) and \u03b1v\u03b2(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).  In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that \u03b1v\u03b2(3)/\u03b1v\u03b2(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases.Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma. Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy.PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study. In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040). Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors.BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose. Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist. Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours.A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity. This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2. The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the \u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 3 and \u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases", "answers": {"answer_start": [126, 117], "text": ["\u03b1v\u03b25", "\u03b1v\u03b23"]}}

The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2].We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) chromosomal analysis. The association of WS and chronic renal failure (CRF) is only rarely encountered. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. To test the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible for the reduced calcitonin levelsIt has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndromeImparied calcitonin secretion in patients with Williams syndrome.in patients with Williams syndrome, we studied five such children, with intravenous calcium and parathyroid hormone infusions as provocative stimuli. These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusionOur studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome.A 16-year-old male adolescent diagnosed to have the Williams-Beuren syndrome was referred to our obesity outpatient clinic, due to his morbid obesity (body mass index 39.2 kilograms per square metre) and gluttony. After several unsuccessful dietary treatments, we started therapy with sibutramine. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.  Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS.Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in a population of 95 WS patients, half of them followed for more than 5 years. Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample)This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHDthe elevated levels of prolactin and the response of hGH to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration are indicative of a hypothalamic rather than pituitary defect. In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS a female presenting with congenital heart defects, liver hemangiomas, and facial dysmorphisms admitted to hospital at 3 months of age because of feeding difficulties and poor growth. She had hypotonia and large tongue, \"coarse\" face, and umbilical hernia in presence of complex congenital cardiovascular malformations. In spite of normal neonatal screening we performed serum levels of thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin level was very high WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVPhigh prevalence of impaired glucose regulation, adults with WS Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentrationWBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature.
