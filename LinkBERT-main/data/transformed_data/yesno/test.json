Surgery remains the elective treatment. We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST. Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST Prognostic factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate and presence of metastases may provide an indication for adjuvant imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment. Here we present a young patient with a large GIST with high-risk features who is in complete remission after surgical excision and adjuvant IM treatment. This patient is the only colon-located CD117-positive case where IM was administered. Imatinib mesylate is the sole BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line treatment of accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). imatinib mesylate could be a therapeutic target of strategies against osteosarcoma tumors. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-established as a potentially curative treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia. The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease. Imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated among patients with meningioma but has modest anti-tumor activity for this indication. Ki67 correlated with time to recurrence (p=0.022). Ki67 >11% was taken as the indication to start imatinib chemotherapy (sensitivity 61.5%, specificity 92.0%, p=0.022). Significant pharmacokinetic interactions have already been shown between St. John's Wort (SJW) and the anticancer drugs imatinib and irinotecan. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The drugs were assessed according to clinical evidence on efficacy and safety, based on Micromedex categorization, on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Indications present in the legal documentation were compared to the indications approved by regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Bevacizumab, capecitabine, cetuximab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib, and temozolomide Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib. Imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST. Surgical indication for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with imatinib is not yet established. Surgery of residual disease upon best clinical response seems associated with survival benefit compared with historical controls in similar patient collectives treated with imatinib alone. To explore the effect of preoperative imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with unresectable or locally advanced primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate Radical surgery remains the most effective method of GIST treatment. In inoperable/metastatic lesion the treatment of choice is tyrosinase kinase inhibitor--imatinib. Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor, has shown a potent antileukemic activity in clinical studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

We show here that the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPM2 is expressed in the phagosomal membrane and regulates macrophage bactericidal activity through the activation of phagosomal acidification The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients. TRPM2 is a recently identified TRPM family cation channel which is unique among known ion channels in that it contains a C-terminal domain which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase and possesses intrinsic ADP-ribose hydrolase activity These results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt. Thus, TRPM2 may play a key role in degranulation by modulating intracellular Ca(2+) in MMCs. he Na+ and Ca(2+)-permeable melastatin related transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) channels can be gated either by ADP-ribose (ADPR) in concert with Ca(2+) or by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), an experimental model for oxidative stress, binding to the channel's enzymatic Nudix domain hese alterations of the extracellular milieu change the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily member 2 (TRPM2), a nonselective cation channel expressed in the central nervous system and the immune system.

We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions. Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive). These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA. However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. . Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations.

Standard treatments for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) show significant side-effects and provide only short-term survival benefits due to disease recurrence. Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association.

In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses.

Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. Quinacrine was less effective.

DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone. Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.  It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.  Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients. Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase II\u03b1 and topoisomerase II\u03b2 and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation.", "label": "yes"}

The nitrone-based compound NXY-059, which is the first drug to reach clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, has provided promise for the development of more robust pharmacological agents.  OKN-007 is a proprietary compound that has had extensive commercial development (designated as NXY-059) for another indication, acute ischemic stroke, and after extensive clinical studies was shown to lack efficacy for this indication but was shown to be very safe for human use.  NXY-059, a polar compound with limited transport across the blood-brain barrier, has demonstrated neuroprotection in several animal models of acute ischemic stroke but failed to confirm clinical benefit in the second phase III trial (SAINT-II). NXY-059 is no longer in development following a lack of efficacy found in a Phase III trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.  We analyzed the quality and adequacy of animal studies supporting the efficacy of NXY-059 and other neuroprotective agents that are currently being investigated in phase II/III trials  In the aftermath of the failed stroke clinical trials with the nitrone spin trap/radical scavenger, NXY-059, a number of articles raised the question: are we doing the right thing?   In 2006, the first positive trial of neuroprotection was published: the SAINT I (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment) study. In February 2008, the SAINT II study was published, indicating that NXY-059 was not effective for AIS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I trial that showed a significant benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY-059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7-category modified Rankin scale (mRS). BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial. The SAINT II Trial, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial of the putative neuroprotectant, NXY-059, failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit in acute ischemic stroke.  The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.  NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS.  NXY-059 is a novel free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. It is the first neuroprotectant to demonstrate a reduction in global disability in a phase III clinical trial, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability.  CONCLUSIONS: The administration of NXY-059 within six hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke significantly improved the primary outcome (reduced disability at 90 days), but it did not significantly improve other outcome measures, including neurologic functioning as measured by the NIHSS score. Additional research is needed to confirm whether NXY-059 is beneficial in ischemic stroke.

The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation. NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.  Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation. Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.  The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B p105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processing The p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursor Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50 NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation", "label": "no"}

Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 25 UK-based breast cancer specialists, this paper explores Herceptin's disputed epistemological status, as an example of pharmacogenetics or as something out of the ordinary in terms of clinical practice. There have been several success stories in the field of pharmacogenetics in recent years, including the analysis of HER2 amplification for trastuzumab selection in breast cancer Trastuzumab is standard of care in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2\u207a early and advanced breast cancer. HER-2 overexpression as a predictor of response to trastuzumab Pharmacogenomic analysis aspires to identify individuals with specific genetic characteristics in order to predict a positive response or reduce a negative response to a therapeutic modality. Assays are available to detect the HER2 protein receptor or copies of the HER2 gene sequence to determine eligibility for Herceptin treatment or adriamycin treatment in node positive patients, respectively. Determining the HER2 status of breast carcinomas is a prerequisite for the use of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which has recently been licensed for the treatment of metastatic disease. Laboratory testing of HER2/neu in breast carcinoma has become vital to patient care following the approval of trastuzumab as the first therapy to target the HER2/neu oncoprotein.

The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.  Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 \u00d7 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-3)).

Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbr\u00fcck Center, Berlin, Germany).  Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population. BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk. Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments. Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis. Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene. Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers. BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction. Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population.", "label": "yes"}

The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling .Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly. We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female. Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D. Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls. The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women. Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.

However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in \"real-life\" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials.

Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.

The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder.  Thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe NET deficiency. A mutation in the human norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associated with orthostatic intolerance disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild-type transporters.  Recently, our laboratory reported a polymorphism in the human NET (hNET) gene A457P in an individual with the autonomic disorder orthostatic intolerance (OI).  Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human NET (hNET) gene that influence transporter function can contribute to disease, such as the nonfunctional transporter, A457P, identified in orthostatic intolerance.  Orthostatic intolerance is not necessarily related to a specific mutation (Ala457Pro) in the human norepinephrine transporter gene.

Use of annexin V antibody to identify apoptotic cells during pregnancy. Only few SF Treg cells were apoptotic, as indicated by limited annexin V staining of these cells. Eosinophils 'aged' in vitro for 48 h exhibited endonuclease DNA degradation, apoptotic morphology, increased red autofluorescence and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) as assessed by binding of FITC-labelled annexin V. In vivo detection of apoptotic cells with fluorescently labeled annexin V is an emerging technique that we evaluated for detecting apoptotic germ cells in a mouse model of testicular torsion.Annexin V labeled with an indocyanine fluorophore (bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) was injected intravenously in mice 18 hours after the repair of unilateral 720-degree testicular torsion for 2 hours Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels might contribute to the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in cardiovascular disease.Flow cytometry was used to assess endothelial cell apoptosis and circulating EPC levels by quantification of circulating CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles and EPC markers (defined as KDRCD133, CD34CD133, CD34KDR) in peripheral blood.In total, 125 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of whom 80 patients (64%) were with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of &lt;20 microg/min, overnight urine samples), 35 patients (28%) with microalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min), and 10 patients (8%) with macroalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate >200 microg/min).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an convenient marker for apoptotic cells. DR5 expression was elevated and associated with the apoptotic marker annexin V. Apoptosis was reduced in CD4(+) T cells when cultured with anti-DR5 antibody. Flow cytometric analysis using the apoptotic marker, Annexin V, shows that this endogenous re-expression is sufficient to drive the SCLC cells to apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. Decreased cell growth was not caused by cell death as BEL exposure did not alter nuclear morphology or increase annexin V (apoptotic cell marker) or propidium iodide (necrotic cell marker) staining after 48 h. Four populations of cells can be identified: region R1: vital cells (annexin V negative/PI negative), region R2: apoptotic cells (annexin V positive/PI negative), region R3: dead cells (annexin V positive/ PI positive); and region R4: damaged cells (annexin V negative/PI positive). Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). Annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells were characterized as early apoptotic, Annexin V(+)/PI(+) as late apoptotic and Annexin V(-)/PI(+) as dead. Targeting ability of Annexin V for apoptotic macrophages was kept and enhanced. [18F]annexin V accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed. The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, TUNEL assay, and Annexin V-Cy3, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry, and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR.  Furthermore, hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3. The procedure delivers two sperm fractions: annexin V-negative (nonapoptotic) and annexin V-positive (apoptotic). The percentage of cells stained with annexin V, an early apoptotic marker, increased dramatically after cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D compared with non-cytochalasin-D-treated controls (P<0.05).  Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA.  We have coupled annexin V with the bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues undergoing apoptosis in vivo. In conlusion, these studies confirm the value of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake as a marker for the detection and quantification of apoptotic cells in vivo.

Rationale for use, clinical trial data, and current recommendations for cabozantinib in renal cell cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and lung cancer are detailed in this article. More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities.

Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome", "label": "no"}

We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types.

Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  The stridor was specific to MSA.  Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  . Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease.

Interestingly, the effects of overexpressed Tcf3 differ between HCT-116 and HCT-R cells In HCT-R cells, however, the overexpression of Tcf3 inhibits Wnt activity, and the cells are still able to proliferate due to the higher expression levels of cell cycle factors, particularly those driving the G(1) to S transition. TCF3 (also known as TCF7L1) is a member of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family that is central in regulating epidermal and embryonic stem cell identity. We found that in contrast to ES cells, where it represses Wnt-pathway target genes, TCF3 promotes the expression of a subset of Wnt-responsive genes in breast cancer cells while repressing another distinct target subset. In the normal mouse mammary gland, Tcf3 is highly expressed in terminal end buds, structures that lead duct development Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog.  Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. The wnt pathway regulates the steady state level of beta-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator for the Tcf3/Lef1 family of DNA binding proteins. Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear, these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces. RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression. The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway. We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. Both Tcf3 depletion and Wnt pathway activation cause increased expression of Oct4, Nanog, and other pluripotency factors and produce ES cells that are refractory to differentiation. Here, we show that injection of a hesx1 morpholino into a 'sensitised' zygotic headless (tcf3) mutant background leads to severe forebrain and eye defects, suggesting an interaction between Hesx1 and the Wnt pathway during zebrafish forebrain development. In addition, we reveal that Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. TCF3, a novel positive regulator of osteogenesis, plays a crucial role in miR-17 modulating the diverse effect of canonical Wnt signaling in different microenvironments. Our studies located the position of Wnts, downstream LEF1 and TCF3 and stem cell marker proteins, which provide new information in understanding the role of the Wnt singaling pathway in whisker follicles' growth. The transcription factor T-cell factor 3 (TCF3), one component of the Wnt pathway, is known as a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that influences the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. Overexpression of TCF3 attenuated the effect of miR-17 on modulating canonical Wnt signaling. We also find that TCF3 phosphorylation is triggered by canonical Wnt ligands, LRP6, and dominant negative mutants for Axin and GSK3, indicating that this process shares the same upstream regulators with \u03b2-catenin stabilization. Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers \u03b2-catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. We show that menin physically interacts with proteins involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin, TCF3 (TCFL1), and weakly with TCF4 (TCFL2). T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs.  factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. Despit rt here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. Thus, Tc Tcf3, is recruited to a palindromic motif enriched in the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. Consistently, abl nonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway controls mESC pluripotency via the Wnt-effector Tcf3. Howe g increases the dissociation of Tcf1 and the association of Tcf3 at promoters of genes that regulate stemness (e.g., NR5A2, Lrh-1) or differentiation (e.g. Cyr61, Zic5). Knockdown of Tcf3 increases pport the existence of a regulatory circuit whereby Wnt/\u03b2-catenin counteracts Tcf3 repression of Lef1, which subsequently activates target gene expression via Lef1-\u03b2-catenin complexes.

RA reduces the phosp BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transcription factor 3 (TCF3) implicates Wnt signaling pathway and regulates E-cadherin expression, which is involved i We demonstrate that mouse Tcf3 mediates repression of both moderate and high levels of canonical Wnt signaling, by either competing with other members of the Tcf/Lef family for binding to \u03b2-catenin, or for binding to DNA. TCF3 is a transcriptional repressor that has been implicated in Wnt signaling and plays key roles in embryonic axis specification and stem cell differentiation. Our data show for the first time that Wnt signaling down-regulates Tcf3 expression, possibly at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and thus highlight a novel mechanism through which Wnt signaling inhibits neuro-ectodermal lineage differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells. We found Tcf3 to be a repressor of Wnt signaling in neocortical NPCs in a reporter gene assay. We found that down-regulation of Tcf3, a member of the Tcf/Lef family and a key player in the control of self-renewal and pluripotency, represents a specific and primary response to Wnt activation in ESCs. Wnt16b also activated the RhoA/Rac1 signaling cascade suggesting the activation of a non-canonical Wnt pathway in TCF3-PBX1 cells. B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene expression has constitutively elevated levels of Wnt16b and ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor), a ligand and a receptor from the Wnt signaling pathway, respectively. We found that in contrast to ES cells, where it represses Wnt-pathway target genes, TCF3 promotes the expression of a subset of Wnt-responsive genes in breast cancer cells while repressing another distinct target subset. Together, these results suggest that Tcf3 antagonizes Wnt signaling in NPCs, thereby maintaining their undifferentiated state in the neocortex and that Wnt signaling promotes the transition from Tcf3-mediated repression to Tcf1/Lef1-mediated enhancement of Wnt signaling, constituting a positive feedback loop that facilitates neuronal differentiation. We also found that Wnt signal stimulation reduces the level of Tcf3, and increases those of Tcf1 (also known as Tcf7) and Lef1, positive mediators of Wnt signaling, in NPCs. These data suggest that in the absence of Wnt signals, Tcf3 may function in skin SCs to maintain an undifferentiated state and, through Wnt signaling, directs these cells along the hair lineage.", "label": "yes"}

The 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used timed functional tests that also sufficiently monitor changes in muscle function; however, they strongly depend on patient collaboration Conclusion: The moderate correlation between functional tests, age and baseline MRI measures supports MRI as a biomarker in Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinical trials. Currently, functional measures continue to serve as the primary outcome for the majority of DMD clinical trials. Patients & methods: Analysis included timed functional tests, knee extension/strength and North Star\u00a0Ambulatory Assessment. The 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used timed functional tests that also sufficiently monitor changes in muscle function; however, they strongly depend on patient collaboration. We have developed a new scale and the associated classification system, to assess the functional ability of children diagnosed with DMD. Preliminary evaluation of the psychometric properties of the functional scale and classification systems indicate sufficient reliability and concurrent validity. Quantitative MRI is an objective and sensitive biomarker to detect subclinical changes, though the examination costs may be a reason for its limited use. In this study, a high correlation between all clinical assessments and quantitative MRI scans was found. The combinational use of these methods provides a better understanding about disease progression; however, longitudinal studies are needed to validate their reliability. The children's functional performance was assessed using 6-minute walk tests and timed performance tests. The correlations between the flexibilities of the lower limb muscles and the performance tests were examined. The flexibilities of the lower extremity muscles were found to be correlated to the 6-minute walk tests and the timed performance tests. The flexibility of the hamstrings (r\u2009=\u2009-.825), the gastrocnemius muscles (r\u2009=\u2009.545), the hip flexors (r\u2009=\u2009.481), and the tensor fascia latae (r\u2009=\u2009.445) were found to be correlated with functional performance as measured by the 6-minute walk tests (P\u2009<\u2009.05) Nine biomarkers have been identified that correlate with disease milestones, functional tests and respiratory capacity. Together these biomarkers recapitulate different stages of the disorder that, if validated can improve disease progression monitoring.  In conclusion, the motor function measure and timed function tests measure disease severity in a highly comparable fashion and all tests correlated with quantitative muscle MRI values quantifying fatty muscle degeneration.  This study is to date the most thorough long-term evaluation of QMT in a cohort of DMD patients correlated with other measures, such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) or three 6-min walk test (6MWT). The MFM scale was a useful instrument in the follow up of patients with DMD. Moreover, it is a more comprehensive scale to assess patients and very good for conducting trials to evaluate treatment. MD subjects were evaluated using the Vignos lower extremity functional rating, and tests including 6\u00a0min walk test (6MWT) and 10\u00a0m walk. TFTs appear to be slightly more responsive and predictive of disease progression than the 6MWT in 7-12.9 year olds. herefore, in our group of ambulant patients with DMD, timed functional testing was the most sensitive parameter to determine the extent of disease progression. Timed functional testing may therefore be considered as an additional outcome measure in drug trials to evaluate the effects of therapy in ambulant patients with DMD and possibly in other neuromuscular disorders. Time to rise is a useful and simple tool in the screening of neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he muscle strength of the wrist extensors and the radial deviation range of motion at the wrist were found to be strongly correlated with six of the seven tasks assessed.

As CHEK2 is a cell-cycle master controller, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the frameshift alteration CHEK2*1100delC is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma. In the current study, we evaluated the possible associations of seven common variants of the DNA repair and cell cycle control genes BRCA2 and CHEK2 with malignant melanoma (MM). Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. CHEK2 is a key cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to unrepaired DNA damage. High-fidelity maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes is ensured by cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. The checkpoint kinase, Chk2, has been implicated in both of these responses. In response to DNA damage, Chk2 is initially phosphorylated at Thr-68, which leads to its full activation. The fully activated Chk2 then phosphorylates downstream substrates of cell cycle control.

Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder.

Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  During a follow-up of 48\u00b194 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with \u03b2-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT).

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system.  Some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. Rare mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with autosomal recessive MTHFR deficiency leading to homocystinuria. Characterization of six novel mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in patients with homocystinuria.

Betaine for treatment of homocystinuria caused by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Severe deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with homocystinuria can result in early demise or later-onset neurological impairment, including developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and seizures.  Deficiency of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) leads to deficient remethylation of homocysteine and is one of the causes of homocystinuria.

Functional tests were performed to study their pathogenicity and understand the disease mechanism.RESULTS: The consistent clinical features of the affected individuals, from seven unrelated families, included choanal atresia, athelia or hypoplastic nipples, branchial sinus abnormalities, neck pits, lacrimal duct anomalies, hearing loss, external ear malformations, and thyroid abnormalities. None of the individuals had intellectual disability. The frequency of clinical features, objective software-based facial analysis metrics, and genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns in these patients were significantly different from that of KS1.

BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.  ECENT FINDINGS: For patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers, sorafenib, selumetinib, pazopanib and sunitinib have been investigated with promising results.  Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Here, selumetinib targets the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in papillary thyroid carcinoma and shows limited single-agent activity in the patients with tumors that harbor the (V600E)BRAF mutation.

The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3.1 (CI: 1.7-5.7). The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.

Resistance training is one of the effective methods to overcome a decline in muscle mass, Therefore, in RT prescription for elbow flexors hypertrophy, single-joint exercises such as BC should be emphasized Our studies establish that resistance training in older adults with type 2 diabetes results in muscle fiber hypertrophy, despite a greater accumulation of inflammatory cytokine transcripts in muscle. Resistance training results in muscle hypertrophy and improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Resistance training (RT) is a popular method of conditioning to enhance sport performance as well as an effective form of exercise to attenuate the age-mediated decline in muscle strength and mass. Enzyme activities, reflecting oxidative potential; decrease during long-term heavy resistance training, resulting in muscle hypertrophy. Optimal adaptations to resistance training (muscle hypertrophy and strength increases) also seem to occur in the late afternoon, which is interesting, since cortisol and, particularly, testosterone (T) concentrations are higher in the morning. Heavy resistance training is associated with increased body weight, lean body mass, and muscle cross-sectional area. The implications for this are (a) athletes are advised to coincide training times with performance times, and (b) individuals may experience greater hypertrophy and strength gains when resistance training protocols are designed dependent on individual T response. Therefore, the combination of resistance training and overexpression of IGF-I induced greater hypertrophy than either treatment alone. The intake of protein after resistance training increases plasma amino acids, which results in the activation of signaling molecules leading to increased muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle hypertrophy. The rate and amount of muscle hypertrophy associated with resistance training is influenced by a wide array of variables including the training program, plus training experience, gender, genetic predisposition, and nutritional status of the individual. Resistance training is commonly prescribed to enhance strength/power qualities and is achieved via improved neuromuscular recruitment, fiber type transition, and/ or skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The mechanisms responsible for the changes in basal post-absorptive protein turnover and its impact on muscle hypertrophy following resistance exercise training are unknown. It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. BACKGROUND: Effects of resistance training on muscle strength and hypertrophy are well established in adults and younger elderly. Chronic resistance training induces increases in muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), otherwise known as hypertrophy.  Resistance training of healthy young men typically results in muscle hypertrophy and a shift in vastus lateralis composition away from type IIx fibers to an increase in IIa fiber content In resistance training, it has been empirically accepted that muscle hypertrophy is developed by low intensity and high volume training, while muscle strength and power are developed by high intensity and low volume training.  gh intensity resistance training (HIRT) has led to increased protein synthesis, along with muscle hypertrophy measured at the whole body, whole muscle, and muscle fibre levels, in older adults. Typica t has been well documented that the increase in strength over the first few weeks of resistance training (i.e. acute) has a strong underlying neural component and further enhancement in strength with long-term (i.e. chronic) resistance training is due to muscle hypertrophy. For Low-intensity blood flow restricted (LI-BFR) resistance training has been shown to produce comparable increases in muscle hypertrophy to traditional high-intensity (HI) resistance training. Ho r adaptations caused by resistance training include increased cross-sectional area of the muscle (hypertrophy, hyperplasia, or both), selective hypertrophy of fast twitch fibers, decreased or maintained mitochondrial number and capillary density of muscle, and possible changes in energy sources. Changes in nerv Skeletal muscle hypertrophy following resistance training is accompanied by a fiber type-specific increase in satellite cell content in elderly men High-intensity resistance (HIR) training has been associated with muscle hypertrophy and decreased microvascular density that might produce a blood flow limitation.

Resistance training increases muscle size (i.e., causes hypertrophy) and muscle strength, particularly in untrained individuals. Hypertrophy is widely believed to be one of the mechanisms (i.e., a mediator) by which resistance training increases strength. Chronic resistance training induces increases in muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), otherwise known as hypertrophy. The aim of the study was to determine whether it is possible to improve both maximum and rapid force production using resistance training that is typically used to induce muscle hypertrophy in previously untrained older men. Is an Energy Surplus Required to Maximize Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy Associated With Resistance Training. We conclude that resistance training of prediabetic obese subjects is effective at changing muscle, resulting in fiber hypertrophy and increased type IIx fiber content, and these changes continue up to 16 wk of training.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Obese, insulin-resistant men responded to 16 wk of progressive resistance training with muscle hypertrophy and increased strength and a shift in muscle fiber composition toward fast-twitch, type IIx fibers. BACKGROUND: Effects of resistance training on muscle strength and hypertrophy are well established in adults and youn Increments in the cross-sectional area of muscle after resistance training can be primarily attributed to fibre hypertrophy. However, no data are reported in the literature to describe and compare the efficacy of the different hypertrophic resistance training strategies in hypoxia.Moreover, improvements in sprinting, jumping, or throwing performance have also been described at terrestrial altitude, encouraging research into the speed of explosive movements at altitude. We conclude that a program of resistance exercise can be safely carried out by elderly women, such a program significantly increases muscle strength, and such gains are due, at least in part, to muscle hypertrophy.", "label": "yes"}

Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and they often facilitate protein-protein interactions. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions. MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools. OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction. It is available at http://www.alok-ai-lab.com/tools/opal/. OPAL+: Length-Specific MoRF Prediction in Intrinsically Disordered Protein Sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain long unstructured regions, which play an important role in their function. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) participate in binding events through regions called molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles.

Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences Using Hierarchical Application of Bayes Rule. Key to their regulatory function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information.

Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences. In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/.

Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. 158 patients (26\u00b72%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25\u00b73%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b703, 95% CI 0\u00b785-1\u00b725). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b786-1\u00b708). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia", "label": "no"}

This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of \u223c30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers.

Both HSS-9 and HSS+3 inducibly associate with acetylated histones, indicative of chromatin remodeling, bind the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)p in vitro and in vivo, and function as enhancers We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision.

The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail.  The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms.  An ASF1-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus. By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners.   This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3.  Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone that can assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation.  Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes.  Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4.

Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations", "label": "yes"}

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranked second and malignant melanoma third Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps more so in black Africans. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Malignant melanomas in black Africans are predominantly located on the lower extremities Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Our findings also indicated that the diagnosis is delayed among black Africans. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. ( Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. Populations of African descent were found to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the sole of the foot. Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the fifth to seventh decades. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to malignant melanoma. This paper reports the incidence of this lesion in association with invasive malignant melanomas of the feet and hands of Black Africans.

Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6 Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in spliceosomal Sm protein B/B' and the Sm-like protein LSm4, and their interaction with the SMN protein. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN. This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.  Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes. In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs. We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN. Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively. Arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains in components of the SMN complex interact with Sm, like-Sm (LSm), fibrillarin, RNA helicase A (Gu), and coilin proteins, all of which are antigen targets in a variety of diseases.", "label": "yes"}

The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called \"contact domains,\" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. \"Loop domains\" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. \"Compartment domains\" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains", "label": "no"}

These infectious yeast amyloidoses are outstanding models for the many common human amyloid-based diseases that are increasingly found to have some infectious characteristics. Yeast prions (infectious proteins) were discovered by their outr\u00e9 genetic properties and have become important models for an array of human prion and amyloid diseases. Yeast prions are models for both rare mammalian prion diseases and for several very common amyloidoses such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and Parkinson's disease.  Yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general, particularly because new evidence is showing infectious aspects of several human amyloidoses not previously classified as prions.  Mechanism of amyloid formation is critical for a complete understanding of the yeast prion phenomenon and human amyloid-related diseases.  Yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general, particularly because new evidence is showing infectious aspects of several human amyloidoses not previously classified as prions. Endogenous yeast amyloids that control heritable traits and are frequently used as models for human amyloid diseases are termed yeast prions. Mechanism of amyloid formation is critical for a complete understanding of the yeast prion phenomenon and human amyloid-related diseases. Here we summarize the results of studies of prions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the use of yeast model for investigation of some human amyloidoses, such as prion diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Yeast prions increasingly are serving as models for the understanding and treatment of many mammalian amyloidoses. Yeast prions, based on self-seeded highly ordered fibrous aggregates (amyloids), serve as a model for human amyloid diseases. These infectious yeast amyloidoses are outstanding models for the many common human amyloid-based diseases that are increasingly found to have some infectious characteristics.<br> The yeast system has provided considerable insight into the biology of amyloid and prions. Yeast prions are important models for human amyloid diseases in general, particularly because new evidence is showing infectious aspects of several human amyloidoses not previously classified as prions. We also review studies of the roles of chaperones, aggregate-collecting proteins, and other cellular components using yeast that have led the way in improving the understanding of similar processes that must be operating in many human amyloidoses.", "label": "yes"}

In the evolution of species, a kind of special sequences, termed ultraconserved sequences (UCSs), have been inherited without any change, which strongly suggests those sequences should be crucial for the species to survive or adapt to the environment. However, the UCSs are still regarded as mysterious genetic sequences so far.

Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S.cerevisiae genome.
