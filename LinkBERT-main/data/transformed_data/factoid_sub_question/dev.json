Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB).MCD were classified following the existing classification schemes (Barkovich et al., 2012. Brain. 135, 1348-1369; Palmini et al., 2004. Neurology. 62, S2-S8) and the ILAE classification for FCD recently proposed by Bl\u00fcmcke in 2011. DISCUSSION: This short review provides an overview of the issues which account for the varied historical approaches to FCD classification and descriptions of gross pathologic findings associated with FCD and an overview of two more recently developed and widely used schema, the Palmini et al. (Neurology 62: S2-8, 2004) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifications Blumcke et al. Epilepsia 52: 158-174, 2011.  In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis.Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells.This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias.Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA.Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB.Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB).Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency.Since early 2000, the definition of FCD has gradually been given a broader interpretation than the case described by Taylor et al., as shown in Palmini's classification (2004) or the newest classification (2011) proposed by the Neuropathology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).Palmini's classification proposed in 2004 is now widely used to categorize FCD.According to Palmini's classification system, these lesions were categorized as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II.In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis.According to Palmini's classification system, these lesions were categorized as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II. According to Palmini's classification system, the following pathologic subgroups were identified: FCD type IA (3/38), FCD type IB (20/38), FCD type IIA (5/38) and FCD type IIB (5/38). In addition, severe pathologic features (Palmini's classification, FCD type II) (p = 0.025) showed significant correlation with a better surgical outcome. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. In detail, according to Palmini's classification, mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs) were disclosed in three patients, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type Ia in three patients, and FCD type Ib in five patients. These results showed considerable improvement compared to a previous study evaluating the 2004 Palmini FCD classification. In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis. Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b. Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA. Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011.Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells.in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized.Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children.In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis.Since early 2000, the definition of FCD has gradually been given a broader interpretation than the case described by Taylor et al., as shown in Palmini&apos;s classification (2004) or the newest classification (2011) proposed by the Neuropathology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

Neuropathologically these diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils.Immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%).We immunohistochemically investigated the degeneration processes of the nigro-striatal and nigro-amygdaloid pathways and the relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy bodies (LB) formation in the substantia nigra using 15 autopsied cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).The substantia nigra possessed alpha-synuclein-positive LB-bearing neurons that were almost evenly distributed, while the putamen exhibited diffuse or granular alpha-synuclein-immunostaining.The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein,Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central constituent of LB.By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon.Notably, carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes were immunodominant in GCIs, but the entire panel of antibodies immunostained cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) in dementia with LBs brain with similar intensity.Discrete immunostaining was demonstrated in NFTs and neuropil threads with various antibodies against phosphorylated tau, and in LBs with antibody against alpha-synuclein.The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease.Alpha-synuclein cortical Lewy bodies correlate with dementia in Parkinson's diseaserecent advances in immunostaining of alpha-synuclein have suggested the possible importance of cortical Lewy bodies (CLBs) in the brains of demented patients with PD.CLBs positive for alpha-synuclein are highly sensitive (91%) and specific (90%) neuropathologic markers of dementia in PDCLBs detected by alpha-synuclein antibodies in patients with PD are a more sensitive and specific correlate of dementiaalpha-Synuclein immunoreactivity in dementia with Lewy bodiesalpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein recently identified as a specific component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites.alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles.The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease.To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs.Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites.These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs.Nigral and cortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic nigral neurites in Parkinson's disease and cortical Lewy body disease contain alpha-synuclein immunoreactivityPD brain demonstrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in nigral Lewy bodies, pale bodies and abnormal neurites.DLB cases demonstrated these findings as well as alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cortical Lewy bodies and CA2-3 neurites.These results suggest that, even in sporadic cases, there is an early and direct role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD and the neuropathologically related disorder DLB.", "answers": {"answer_start": [449], "text": ["alpha-Synuclein"]}}

The mRNA profiler array showed more than 2-fold differential expression of 32 oxidative stress-related genes in unstimulated moDCs, including peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), an enzyme reducing hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx-2) is an abundant mammalian enzyme that protects against oxidative stress.Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) has been known to act as an antioxidant enzyme whose main function is H(2)O(2) reduction in cells. These data indicate that Srx1 activity protects mice from the lethality of endotoxic shock, adding this enzyme to other host factors, as NRF2 and peroxiredoxin 2, which by regulating cellular reactive oxygen species levels act as important modifiers in the pathogenesis of sepsis.One of the identified proteins was peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), an anti-oxidant enzyme. Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2), a potent peroxide reductant, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte and might be expected to play a major role in the cell's oxidative defenses. Importantly, we also demonstrate the antioxidant enzyme Prx2 (peroxiredoxin 2) as a critical cytoplasmic target of cdk5. Human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a typical 2-cys cytosolic peroxiredoxin with thiol-dependent hydrogen peroxide scavenger activity. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that uses cysteine residues to decompose peroxides.Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), an antioxidant enzyme, was the most upregulated while tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), a pro-apoptotic protein, was the most downregulated, implying a beneficial effect of lithium on neuronal cells.After 5 Gy irradiation, the relative abundance of peroxiredoxin 2, an antioxidant enzyme, and latexin, an inhibitor of carboxypeptidase, increased. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a thiol-dependent peroxidase, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte, and its absence in knock-out mice gives rise to hemolytic anemia. Suppression subtractive hybridization performed on Down syndrome (DS) versus control fetal brains revealed differential expression of peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), mapped at 13q12.

Furthermore, ID3 alone imparted GSC features to primary astrocytes derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mouse, and EGFR-ID3-IL-6 signaling axis gave rise to tumor cell heterogeneity.Oral administration of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) protects the immature gut from injury via Smad protein-dependent suppression of epithelial nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production.TGF-\u03b21 effects appear to be mediated through the canonical Smad pathwayNumerous studies have shown that TGF-\u03b2 is the most important cytokine in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and plays a role through its downstream signaling molecule TGF-binding receptor Smads protein.TGF-beta, a pleiotropic cytokine, regulates numerous genes involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis via activation of the Smads proteins and MUC4 promoter is rich in Smad-binding elements.Cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily transduce their signals by activating receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads).Altogether, these results indicate that upregulation of MUC4 by TGF-beta is restricted to well-differentiated pancreatic cancer cells, and point out a novel mechanism for TGF-beta as a key molecule in targeting MUC4 overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.TGF\u03b2 signaling activates receptor SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, which associate with a variety of nuclear factors to regulate gene transcription.We demonstrate that exogenous TGF-beta(1) can inhibit the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule, E-selectin, in vascular endothelium exposed to inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo.Conversely, in conjunction with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, TGF\u03b2 promotes Th17 cell differentiation.TGF\u03b2 is the quintessential cytokine of T cell homeostasis.Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-beta/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops., we have studied the immediate responses provoked by TGF-beta in major signaling pathways, and we have found that it induces a rapid activation of the SMAD pathway, i.e., phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2, followed by dephosphorylation, most probably due to degradation by the proteasome. However, similar Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that induces growth arrest, tissue fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. EMT is  well-understood classical TGF-beta signaling pathway, TGF-beta activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as TbetaRII and ALK5/TbetaRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In additihe role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a key molecule in the development and progression of hepatic fibrosis via the activation of hepatic stellate cells, among other fibroblast populations, is without controversy. We hern, we show that: 1) TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly located on basolateral membrane and receptor stimulation activates Smad pathway; 2) TGF-beta1 down-regulates IL-6-induced tyrosine phoshorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ICAM-1 expression; and 3) Smad2 is required for the down-regulation of IL-6 signaling by TGF-beta. Collectively, our with an increase in TGF-beta in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant increases in phospho-Smad2, a major downstream signaling molecule of TGF-beta, in hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched control patients. However, in contraIn the past three years, a novel signal transduction pathway downstream of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily receptor serine-threonine kinases has been shown to be mediated by a family of latent transcription factors called 'Smads'. Thesemonstrate that the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which also permanently activates its canonical signalling pathway through SMAD proteins in BPH-1 cells, modifies the effects of IL-6 on cell proliferation. Importanth transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the most potent fibrogenic cytokine for HSCs, which classically activates Smad signaling, and p38 MAPK signaling have been shown to influence collagen gene expression; however, the relative contribution and mechanisms that these two signaling pathways have in regulating collagen gene expression have not been investigated. The aim Design, synthesis and discovery of 2(1H)-quinolone derivatives for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through inhibition of TGF-\u03b2/smad dependent and independent pathway.Further mechanism studies indicated that 20f reduced the expression of fibrogenic phenotypic protein \u03b1-SMA and collagen \u2160 by inhibiting the TGF-\u03b2/Smad dependent pathways and ERK1/2 and p38 pathways.Of these compounds, 20f was identified as the most active one and could inhibit TGF-\u03b2-induced collagen deposition of NRK-49F cells and mouse fibroblasts migration with comparable activity and lower cytotoxicity than nintedanib in vitro.One such a molecule is transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), a cytokine produced by many inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells and targeting virtually all the intestinal mucosal cell types, with the down-stream effect of activating intracellular Smad2/3 proteins and suppressing immune reactions.In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), there is defective TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling due to high Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 activity.We here review the role of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad7 in intestinal immunity, inflammation, and cancer.Indeed, knockdown of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores endogenous TGF-\u03b21 activity, thereby inhibiting inflammatory pathways in patients with IBD and colitic mice.Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) regulates cell junction restructuring via Smad-mediated repression and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of nectin-like molecule 2 (Necl-2).Taken together, TGF-\u03b21 is a potent cytokine that provides an effective mechanism in controlling Necl-2 expression in the testis via Smad-dependent gene repression and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Mutational studies coupled with knockdown experiments have shown that TGF-\u03b21-induced Necl-2 repression requires activation of Smad proteins.In addition, TGF-\u03b21 reduces Necl-2 mRNA via down-regulating Necl-2 promoter activity.EMSA and ChIP assays further confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 promotes the binding of Smad proteins onto MyoD and CCAATa motifs in vitro and in vivo.We have demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 reduces Necl-2 mRNA and protein levels at both transcriptional and post-translational levels.Using inhibitor and clathrin shRNA, we have revealed that TGF-\u03b21 induces Necl-2 protein degradation via clathrin-dependent endocytosis.Endocytosis assays further confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 accelerates the internalization of Necl-2 protein to cytosol.Immunofluorescence staining also revealed that TGF-\u03b21 effectively removes Necl-2 from cell-cell interface.TGF-beta-mediated Smad transcriptional activity was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of IFN-gamma.Such impairment of TGF-beta functions were not observed in SOCS3-overexpressed cells, indicating that suppression of Smads was independent of SOCS3.plus TGF-beta enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat expression and suppressed IFN-gamma production in wild-type T cells, whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells.Activins belong to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family of multifunctional cytokines and signal via the activin receptors ALK4 or ALK7 to activate the SMAD2/3 pathway.TGFbeta binding to serine/threonine kinase receptors on the plasma membrane activates Smad molecules and additional signaling proteins that together regulate gene expression.Activins as Dual Specificity TGF-\u03b2 Family Molecules: SMAD-Activation via Activin- and BMP-Type 1 Receptors.Distinct R-Smads or combinations of R-Smads are activated by TGF-beta, activin, or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).TGF-\u03b2 signals through receptors to activate Smad proteins, which translocate into the nucleus.TGF-beta (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) cytokines employ Smad proteins as the intracellular mediator of signaling.Canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling results in the activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate target gene expression.Upon activation, the TGF-beta type I receptor phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, which then form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription of a variety of genes that encode crucial determinants of cell fate, such as cell cycle components, differentiation factors and cell adhesion molecules.In endothelial cells, TGF-beta binds to two distinct type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, ALK-5 and ALK-1; the latter activates the same R-Smads that are activated by BMP and induces synthesis of Id (inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins.To maintain intestinal integrity, the epithelial cells, myeloid cells and lymphocytes that inhabit the gut secrete TGF-\u03b2, which acts in both paracrine and autocrine fashions to activate its signal transducers, the SMAD transcription factors.Activation of TGF-\u03b2 receptors leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which oligomerize with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they recognize gene regulatory regions and orchestrate transcription.Upon TGF-beta stimulation, the cytoplasmic Smads become phosphorylated and consequently accumulate in the nucleus to regulate target gene expression.In summary, our data show that S1P trans-activates the TGF-beta receptor and triggers activation of Smads followed by activation of connective tissue growth factor gene transcription and inhibition of IL-1beta-induced expression of iNOS, sPLA(2), and MMP-9.", "answers": {"answer_start": [9119, 2735], "text": ["TGFbeta", "TGF\u03b2"]}}

ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are a class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cellsThe DNA helicase Rrm3 promotes replication fork progression through >1000 discrete genomic regions and represses the cDNA-mediated mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon. We explored the connection between DNA replication and Ty1 retromobility by investigating the basis of increased retromobility in an rrm3 mutant. Even though Ty1 cDNA levels are increased in the absence of RRM3, neither the level nor target-site specificity of cDNA integration was alteredWe propose that RNA:DNA hybrid regions within nascent retrotransposition events block replication in an rrm3 mutant, leading to chromosome breaks within Ty1 sequencesWe demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3 However, the essential nuclear function of Pfh1p could be supplied by Rrm3p. Expression of Rrm3p suppressed the accumulation of DNA damage foci but not the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cells depleted of nuclear Pfh1p. Together, these data demonstrate that Pfh1p has essential roles in the replication of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activitiesRrm3p is a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase that helps replication forks traverse protein-DNA complexes.

SMM serves as methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine, catalyzed by homocysteine S-methyltransferase (HMT).Plants synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and methionine (Met) by a unique reaction and, like other organisms, use SMM as a methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine (Hcy).AtHMT-1 and -2 both utilize l-SMM or (S,S)-AdoMet as a methyl donor in vitro and have higher affinities for SMM.When the serine residue is mutated to glutamic acid, which mimics the phosphorylated serine residue, the mutant CARM1 exhibits diminished ability to bind the methyl donor adenosylmethionine and diminished histone methylation activity.S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation was fed with ethanol for 1month in order to modify the effects of ethanol on rat liver.To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine.The enzyme was capable of transferring methyl groups to selected lysine residues in a substrate protein using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.SAM is the main methyl group donor for methyltransferases to modify DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites, or phospholipid target substrates.To control the enzymatic activity of vSET in vivo with an engineered S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) analogue as methyl donor cofactor, we have carried out structure-guided design, synthesis, and characterization of orthogonal vSET methyltransferase mutant/SAM analogue pairs using a \"bump-and-hole\" strategy.Protein lysine methyltransferases are important regulators of epigenetic signaling.One of the well-studied PTMs, arginine methylation, is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with SAM as the methyl donor.While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation.The purified cytochrome can act as a methyl acceptor for a methyltransferase activity in the cell extract that uses S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor.This enzyme utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1954, 1979, 629, 607, 295, 1822], "text": ["S-adenosyl-L-methionine", "SAM", "AdoMet", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "adenosylmethionine", "S-Adenosyl methionine"]}}

Previous methods have been dependent on the number of telomeres present in a cell being known, which may be problematic when analysing aneuploid cancer data and non-human samples. Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons. We also apply the method to a cancer cell data, uncovering an interesting relationship with the underlying telomerase genotype.Telomerecat: A ploidy-agnostic method for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data.Telomere length is a risk factor in disease and the dynamics of telomere length are crucial to our understanding of cell replication and vitality.

In cultured cells, overexpression of VPS4A mutants caused enlarged endosomal vacuoles resembling those induced by expression of known dominant-negative ATPase-defective forms of VPS4A. Proband-derived fibroblasts had enlarged endosomal structures with abnormal accumulation of the ESCRT protein IST1 on the limiting membrane. VPS4A function was also required for normal endosomal morphology and IST1 localization in iPSC-derived human neurons.
