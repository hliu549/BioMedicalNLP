Despite the difficulty in analyzing such diverse data, these results draw attention to the favorable effect of dural detachment (instead of maximizing the resection rate) on long-term tumor control. Surgical strategy with an emphasis on detaching the tumor from the affected dura might be another important option in resection of high-risk meningiomas not amenable to gross-total resection."}, {"qas": [{"id": "56c1f010ef6e394741000041_007", "question": "Simpson grading is used to describe resection of which brain tumor?", "answers": [{"text": "meningioma", "answer_start": 121}]}], "context": "The relevance of Simpson Grade I and II resection in modern neurosurgical treatment of World Health Organization Grade I meningiomas."}, {"qas": [{"id": "56c1f010ef6e394741000041_008", "question": "Simpson grading is used to describe resection of which brain tumor?", "answers": [{"text": "meningioma", "answer_start": 22}]}], "context": "Surgery for convexity meningioma: Simpson Grade I resection as the goal: clinical article."}, {"qas": [{"id": "56c1f010ef6e394741000041_009", "question": "Simpson grading is used to describe resection of which brain tumor?", "answers": [{"text": "meningioma", "answer_start": 24}]}], "context": "However, for skull base meningiomas, in which mostly Simpson Grade II resection is achieved, the use of this classification should be further validated.

"In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a \u03b2-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org)."}, {"qas": [{"id": "589635dd78275d0c4a000009_003", "question": "Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?", "answers": [{"text": "LARVA", "answer_start": 0}]}], "context": "LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations"}, {"qas": [{"id": "589635dd78275d0c4a000009_004", "question": "Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?", "answers": [{"text": "LARVA", "answer_start": 0}]}], "context": "LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5896271178275d0c4a000004_001", "question": "Which disease is treated with lucinactant?", "answers": [{"text": "respiratory distress syndrome", "answer_start": 34}]}], "context": "Lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5896271178275d0c4a000004_002", "question": "Which disease is treated with lucinactant?", "answers": [{"text": "respiratory distress syndrome", "answer_start": 33}]}], "context": "Lucinactant for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates."}, {"qas": [{"id": "589630f378275d0c4a000007_001", "question": "Which enzyme is inhibited by ixazomib?", "answers": [{"text": "proteasome", "answer_start": 180}]}], "context": "Over the past decade, MM therapy is significantly improved by the introduction of novel therapeutics such as immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab and elotuzumab), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Panobinostat)."}, {"qas": [{"id": "589630f378275d0c4a000007_002", "question": "Which enzyme is inhibited by ixazomib?", "answers": [{"text": "proteasome", "answer_start": 50}]}], "context": "Ixazomib (MLN9708-MLN2238), the second-generation proteasome inhibitor, selectivity and potency were similar to that of bortezomib, is currently being investigated in phase I studies."}, {"qas": [{"id": "589630f378275d0c4a000007_003", "question": "Which enzyme is inhibited by ixazomib?", "answers": [{"text": "proteasome", "answer_start": 107}]}], "context": "In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively."}, {"qas": [{"id": "589630f378275d0c4a000007_004", "question": "Which enzyme is inhibited by ixazomib?", "answers": [{"text": "proteasome", "answer_start": 25}]}], "context": "Ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor to be evaluated in multiple myeloma, exerts substantial anti-myeloma activity as a single agent and particularly in combination with immunomodulatory drugs and it may be an attractive option for maintenance therapy.

ini1 brachyury s100 and cytokeratins and conducted a genetic analysis on the smarcb1 coding sequence nm 003073 using the sanger method and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to detect abnormal copy numbers of the gene locus all 8 cases were positive for brachyury whereas there was no nuclear smarcb1 ini1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases including the poorly differentiated chordoma genetic analysis identified a missense mutation in 2 cases and a nonsense mutation associated with loss of smarcb1 ini1 protein and features of poorly differentiated tumor in 1 these mutations were

All 100 had fever, sore throat, and erythema of tonsils. Twenty of the 100 patients had tonsillar exudates, 85/100 had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and 86/100 had no cough. In total, 9 out of the 100 patients had positive throat cultures. We observed that petechiae over the palate, a very significant sign, is not included in the Centor Criteria. Palatal petechiae were present in 8 out of the 100 patients. Six out of these 8 with palatal petechiae had positive throat culture for strep (75%). Only 7 out of 20 with exudates had positive strep culture. Sixteen out of the 100 patients had rapid strep test positive. Those 84/100 who had negative rapid strep also had negative throat culture.We used Fisher's exact test, comparing throat culture positive and negative versus presence of exudates and palatal hemorrhages with positive and negative throat cultures and the resultant P value <.0001.Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5a6f960fb750ff445500005c_011", "question": "Centor criteria are used for which disease?", "answers": [{"text": "streptococcal pharyngitis", "answer_start": 1220}]}], "context": "to determine the validity of the rapid antigen test rat osom strepa genzyme for the diagnosis of acute pharyngitis caused by group a beta haemolytic strep gabhs diagnostic techniques survey urban primary care centre spain all patients over 14 years old seen in 6 surgeries with sore throat and 2 or more centor criteria pharyngotonsillar exudate tender laterocervical nodes absence of coughing and or history or presence of fever pharyngeal swabs were taken from all the patients one for rat and another to send for culture in the microbiology department a total of 182 patients were evaluable with a mean age of 30 6 12 1 years of which 116 were women 63 7 63 patients had 2 centor criteria 83 had 3 and 36 the 4 criteria the culture was positive in 102 patients 56 with gabhs showing infection in forty 22 95 confidence interval ci 21 2 22 8 group c streptococcus was isolated in 26 patients 14 3 gabhs was higher among patients with four centor criteria 38 9 vs 25 3 observed among those with 3 criteria and 7 9 with 2 criteria p 001 sensitivity of rat was 95 with a specificity of 93 a positive predictive value of 79 2 and a negative predictive value of 98 5 these results show the usefulness of rat for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis its use should be spread to all primary care practices."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5a87f44061bb38fb2400000f_001", "question": "Which disorder has been approved for treatment with Alk inhibitors?", "answers": [{"text": "ALK-positive lung cancer", "answer_start": 192}]}], "context": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is detected in 3-7% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

Variant call format (VCF) is a general text-based format developed to store variant genotypes and their annotations. However, VCF files are large and data retrieval is relatively slow. Here we introduce a new WGS variant data format implemented in the R/Bioconductor package 'SeqArray' for storing variant calls in an array-oriented manner which provides the same capabilities as VCF, but with multiple high compression options and data access using high-performance parallel computing.Results: Benchmarks using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data show file sizes are 14.0\u2009Gb (VCF), 12.3\u2009Gb (BCF, binary VCF), 3.5\u2009Gb (BGT) and 2.6\u2009Gb (SeqArray) respectively. Reading genotypes in the SeqArray package are two to three times faster compared with the htslib C library using BCF files. For the allele frequency calculation, the implementation in the SeqArray package is over 5 times faster than PLINK v1.9 with VCF and BCF files, and over 16 times faster than vcftools.

We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions.

One strategy is to modify the read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to BS-seq alignment, with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be attainable.Results: We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the BS-seq computational logic into both GPU and CPU code throughout the Arioc implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than the other read aligners we evaluated.

Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex \"map\" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization.

The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression. The umbrella of melanocytes associated with the haematopoietic niche is highly evolutionarily conserved in aquatic animals, including the sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate. During the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, HSPCs relocated into the bone marrow, which is protected from ultraviolet light by the cortical bone around the marrow. Our studies reveal that melanocytes above the haematopoietic niche protect HSPCs from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates and suggest that during the transition to terrestrial life, ultraviolet light was an evolutionary pressure affecting the location of the haematopoietic niche."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5d387573a1e159510500000a_001", "question": "Which is the primary interacting protein of BLK?", "answers": [{"text": "BANK1", "answer_start": 45}]}], "context": "Gene-gene interaction of ATG5, ATG7, BLK and BANK1 in systemic lupus erythematosus."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5d387573a1e159510500000a_002", "question": "Which is the primary interacting protein of BLK?", "answers": [{"text": "BANK1", "answer_start": 124}]}], "context": "Autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), ATG7, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) and B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1 (BANK1) are involved in B-cell signaling;"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5d387573a1e159510500000a_003", "question": "Which is the primary interacting protein of BLK?", "answers": [{"text": "BANK1", "answer_start": 49}]}], "context": "The B cell adaptor protein with ankyrin repeats (BANK1) and the B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) have been genetically associated with autoimmunity.

The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage.

We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e36d5b9b5b409ea53000009_002", "question": "Which algorithm has been developed for detecting expansions of tandem repeats?", "answers": [{"text": "ExpansionHunter", "answer_start": 36}]}], "context": "We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that , using PCR-free WGS short-read data , can genotype repeats at the locus of interest , even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e319617fbd6abf43b000049_001", "question": "Which clotting factor is in the Andexxa?", "answers": [{"text": "Xa", "answer_start": 47}]}], "context": "Intravenous andexanet alfa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo; Andexxa\u00ae] is a first-in-class recombinant modified factor Xa protein that has been developed by Portola Pharmaceuticals as a universal antidote to reverse anticoagulant effects of direct or indirect factor Xa inhibitors.

However, nearly all patients ultimately become refractory due to the development of docetaxel resistance. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020).

Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results: The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls. Overall, this is the first complete effort to implement procedures for analysis and meta-analysis in GWAS using Stata.Availability and Implementation: A Stata program and a web-server are freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/GWAR."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e50123e6d0a277941000036_002", "question": "Which programming language has been used for implementing GWAR?", "answers": [{"text": "Stata", "answer_start": 35}]}], "context": "Availability and Implementation\n\nA Stata program and a web-server are freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/GWAR."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e6e8f92c6a8763d23000004_001", "question": "How large is a lncRNAs?", "answers": [{"text": ">200 nucleotides", "answer_start": 29}]}], "context": " long noncoding RNA (lncRNA, >200 nucleotides)"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e3c686fb5b409ea53000020_001", "question": "What is Telangiectasia?", "answers": [{"text": "prominent small vessels", "answer_start": 20}]}], "context": "Telangiectasias are prominent small vessels (venules, capillaries or arterioles) that are visible as small red-purple focal lesions in the skin and mucous membranes."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e7f64d6835f4e477700001f_001", "question": "How is ZP-PTH delivered to patients?", "answers": [{"text": "transdermal drug-coated microneedle patch system", "answer_start": 65}]}], "context": "To evaluate the clinical PK/PD of PTH(1-34) delivered by a novel transdermal drug-coated microneedle patch system (ZP-PTH) for the treatment of osteoporosis."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e805e62835f4e4777000023_001", "question": "Which gene is mutated in the classic Bartter's syndrome?", "answers": [{"text": "Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB.", "answer_start": 0}]}], "context": "Classic Bartter's syndrome has been demonstrated to result from defective chloride transport across the basolateral membrane in the distal nephron due to mutations in the chloride channel gene CLCNKB."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e5438c3b761aafe09000003_001", "question": "Name a selective NK3R agonist.", "answers": [{"text": "senktide", "answer_start": 18}]}], "context": "Administration of senktide, highly potent and selective NK3R agonist, resulted in increase of serum LH concentration, induction of VMS, increase in heart rate, and skin temperature in postmenopausal women."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e808ef4835f4e477700002a_001", "question": "What is the target of the drug Olmesartan?", "answers": [{"text": "angiotensin II receptor", "answer_start": 105}]}], "context": "Olmesartan (OL) is the pharmacologically active metabolite of Olmesartan medoxomil (OM), an FDA-approved angiotensin II receptor antagonist for administrating cardiovascular diseases."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5d38767ca1e159510500000b_001", "question": "In which cells does TLR7 escape X-chromosome inactivation?", "answers": [{"text": "immune cells", "answer_start": 135}]}], "context": " TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e52a7b66d0a277941000045_001", "question": "Which tool has been developed for prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning?", "answers": [{"text": "DeepCpG", "answer_start": 0}]}], "context": "DeepCpG: accurate prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5e52a7b66d0a277941000045_002", "question": "Which tool has been developed for prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning?", "answers": [{"text": "DeepCpG", "answer_start": 277}]}], "context": "Recent technological advances have enabled DNA methylation to be assayed at single-cell resolution.

Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.Results: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.Availability and implementation: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.Contact: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74266a7c78d694710000a2_001", "question": "Which biological process takes place in nuclear speckles?", "answers": [{"text": "mRNA splicing", "answer_start": 180}]}], "context": "Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins.

15,000 live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_001", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 75}]}], "context": "Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_002", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 52}]}], "context": "Here, we show that Rbfox2 is a novel constituent of cytoplasmic stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to cellular stress."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_003", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 33}]}], "context": "Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_004", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 94}]}], "context": "In this study, we firstly have examined this punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs)"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_005", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 26}]}], "context": "Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that are formed in cells when stress occurs."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_006", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 68}]}], "context": "Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules."}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_007", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 55}]}], "context": "We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress"}, {"qas": [{"id": "5c74285c7c78d694710000a3_008", "question": "In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?", "answers": [{"text": "cytoplasm", "answer_start": 60}]}], "context": ".

While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of \u223c70 million nodes with \u223c68 billion edges in \u223c2.4 h. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks.

In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners.

Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function.

In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al.

The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients.

We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease.

We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of DNA binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each TF.
