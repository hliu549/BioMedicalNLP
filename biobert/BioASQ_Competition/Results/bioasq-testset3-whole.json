Others may soon be (quizartinib, APR246 magrolimab, menin inhibitors). The fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor gilteritinib is indicated for relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), based on its observed superior response and survival outcomes compared with salvage chemotherapy (SC). Similarly high rates of composite complete remission (CRc) were observed in patients who received a FLT3 TKI before gilteritinib (CHRYSALIS, 42%; ADMIRAL, 52%) and those without prior FLT3 TKI therapy (CHRYSALIS, 43%; ADMIRAL, 55%). In this study, to identify therapeutic targets responsible for the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells (blasts) with FLT3 mutations after gilteritinib (GILT, a 2nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)) treatment, we performed proteomic screening of cytokine release and in vitro/ex vivo studies to investigate their associated signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation.",

      "ideal_answer": "Two genes are synthetic lethal if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but mutation of both leads to death. So, targeting a gene that is synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and spare normal cells. Synthetic lethality therefore provides a conceptual framework for the development of cancer-specific cytotoxic agents. Synthetic lethality occurs when the simultaneous perturbation of two genes results in cellular or organismal death. A synthetic lethal interaction occurs between two genes when the perturbation of either gene alone is viable but the perturbation of both genes simultaneously results in the loss of viability. Key to exploiting synthetic lethality in cancer treatment are the identification and the mechanistic characterization of robust synthetic lethal genetic interactions.",
