5c59872b86df2b9174000017	Which tool has been developed for coverage calculation for genomes?	Mosdepth: quick coverage calculation for genomes and exomes. Mosdepth is a new command-line tool for rapidly calculating genome-wide sequencing coverage. It measures depth from BAM or CRAM files at either each nucleotide position in a genome or for sets of genomic regions. Genomic regions may be specified as either a BED file to evaluate coverage across capture regions, or as a fixed-size window as required for copy-number calling. Mosdepth uses a simple algorithm that is computationally efficient and enables it to quickly produce coverage summaries. We demonstrate that mosdepth is faster than existing tools and provides flexibility in the types of coverage profiles produced.Availability and implementation: mosdepth is available from https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth under the MIT license.

5aafc37afcf4565872000010	What is the function of HDAC  proteins?	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription.  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms Accumulating evidence has implicated histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation in diverse embryonic and adult tissues. The function of eukaryotic histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been extensively studied for its critical role in transcriptional regulation and carcinogenesis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression that require assembly into larger protein complexes for activity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDAC is a family of enzymes involved in deacetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. Gene expression is in part controlled by chromatin remodeling factors and the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. The latter process is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to remove acetyl groups from histone tails. This liberates positive charges on the histone tail and allows for tighter winding of DNA, preventing transcription factor binding and gene activation Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases catalyze the reversible acetylation of histones and nonhistone substrates to control the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of normal and tumor cells Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify core histones and participate in large regulatory complexes that both suppress and enhance transcription Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins. The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones.

52f509512059c6d71c000020	What is the mode of inheritance of short QT syndrome?	Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested.  From 1993, the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) came to our attention, as a new inherited "electrical disease" associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. Mutations of Ikr, Iks, Ikl channels cause dysfunctional Iks, Ikr, Ikl channels with an increase in the net outward K current leading to shortening of repolarization. This in turn leads to a shorter QT interval on the ECG and shorter atrial and ventricular refractory periods with increased susceptibility to VF and AF. There seems to be an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.	['autosomal dominant mode of inheritance']

532ff917d6d3ac6a34000038	What histone trimethylation has been associated to RNA splicing?	histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site. ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation. Vezf1 interacts with Mrg15/Mrgbp, a protein that recognizes H3K36 trimethylation, consistent with the role of histone modifications at alternatively spliced sites H2BK123ub1 is also a feature of introns in the yeast genome, and the disruption of this modification alters the intragenic distribution of H3 trimethylation on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which functionally correlates with alternative RNA splicing in humans We investigated whether a causal relationship exists between splicing and chromatin modification by asking whether splice-site mutations affect the methylation of histone H3K36  splicing can also contribute to histone modification, Genome-wide analysis of histone methylation in human cell lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing genes are preferentially marked with histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H3K36me3)   transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined, and that modified nucleosomes with trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone subunit 3 (H3K36me3) are enriched at internal exons and the downstream flanking intronic regions of highly expressed genes methylated H3K4 serves to facilitate the competency of pre-mRNA maturation 	['H3K36me3']

58cbd0d502b8c60953000035	Which mutated gene causes the Chédiak–Higashi Syndrome?	We detected a homozygous missense mutation (c.4189T>G, p.F1397V) in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which is described as the causative gene for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS).  A frameshift mutation in the LYST gene is responsible for the Aleutian color and the associated Chédiak-Higashi syndrome in American mink. As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene.  LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients.  Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism.  Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. This phenotype is similar to that reported previously in lvsB mutant cells where the ortholog of the LYST gene, involved in CHS, is mutated Rarely, an association of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, Machado-Joseph disease related to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome caused by mutations in ATP13A2 gene, or in hereditary systemic disorders such as Gaucher disease due to mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and Chediak-Higashi syndrome due to LYST gene mutations. LYST is a large cytosolic protein that influences the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and mutation of the encoding gene, LYST, can cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in Japanese Black cattle, caused by a mutation of the Lyst gene. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding LYST protein, the function of which remains poorly understood. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases.	['lysosomal trafficking regulator gene', 'LYST gene']

Homozygous mutations in LPIN2 are responsible for the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (Majeed syndrome). The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families.  We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome.   genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause Majeed syndrome Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is caused by mutations in LPIN2 ittle is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. An S734L mutation in LPIN2 causes Majeed syndrome Little is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome.

We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77 %) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. The retrovirus-like element Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates at the transcription initiation region of RNA polymerase III. Ty3 inserts at transcription initiation sites of genomic tRNA genes and plasmid-borne 5S and U6 RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.  Sites of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation and Ty3 integration at the U6 gene are positioned by the TATA box  the U6 TATA box is essential in vivo for correct initiation but not for transcription, (ii) a TATA box does not compensate for a weak box A sequence and so cannot perform equivalently, and (iii) the TATA-binding protein, and probably components of transcription factor IIIB, are present on the target at the time of Ty3 integration. Ty3 integrates within the region of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation Ty3 was shown to insert upstream of tRNA, 5S, and U6 genes, all of which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III Transfer RNA genes are genomic targets for de Novo transposition of the yeast retrotransposon Ty3. Thus, genomic insertions of Ty3 in a particular orientation are apparently specified by the target, while the actual position of the insertion relative to the tRNA-coding sequence can vary slightly.

51739df58ed59a060a00001c	Which is the most important prognosis sub-classification in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia?	One of the most reliable prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, which defines 2 subsets, mutated CLL (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), with different clinical courses. Mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHVs) of CLL cells offers useful prognostic information for high-risk patients but time and economical costs originally prevented it from being routinely used in a clinical setting.

55200c606b348bb82c000013	Which clotting factor is inhibited by betrixaban?	Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.  Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150).  They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others).  Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.   These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO-14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG1,2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. The majority of the drugs in development belong to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors (the -xabans). These include betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, and LY517717. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban.  EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa.  Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, the direct thrombin antagonist dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are more predictable and convenient anticoagulants in comparison with warfarin, mainly because of the non-requirement of regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban.  Direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxiban, which has shown promising results for VTE prophylaxis and is being studied for VTE treatment, as well as apixaban and betrixaban, which are at earlier stages of clinical validation. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation.  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.

56d1da3b67f0cb3d66000006	How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates?	Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.

5e36a718b5b409ea53000004	Which T-UCR has been implicated in prostate cancer?	Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. Docetaxel is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, nearly all patients ultimately become refractory due to the development of docetaxel resistance. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC.

CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs.  Here, we describe that treatment of multiple myeloma patients with daratumumab, a novel anti-CD38 MoAb, resulted in false-positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs) for all patients for 2 to 6 months after infusion.  Interference of daratumumab and three other anti-CD38 MoAbs was studied using fresh-frozen plasma spiked with different MoAb concentrations. Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma.

In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in CD38-expressing lymphoma- and MM-derived cell lines as well as in patient MM cells, both with autologous and allogeneic effector cells.  Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient MM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were not affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenvironment.

55421398ccca0ce74b000001	What type of DNA repair pathways is initiated by AlkA glycosylase?	The Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein (AlkA) recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair pathway. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two paralogues of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, Mag1p and Mag2p, which share homology with Escherichia coli AlkA. To clarify the function of these redundant enzymes in base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage Escherichia coli alkA tagA double mutants, which are deficient in the repair of alkylated bases. AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, is structurally homologous to endo III. We have now identified a shared active site motif amongst these three proteins. Using this motif as a protein database searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions.

Tafazzin is a mitochondrial phospholipid transacylase, and its mutations cause Barth syndrome (BTHS) Tafazzin, a mitochondrial acyltransferase, plays an important role in cardiolipin side chain remodeling. Previous studies have shown that dysfunction of tafazzin reduces cardiolipin content, impairs mitochondrial function, and causes dilated cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ) A zebrafish model of human Barth syndrome reveals the essential role of tafazzin in cardiac development and function. Barth syndrome: cellular compensation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis inhibition due to changes in cardiolipin remodeling linked to tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutation. This resynthesis of deacylated cardiolipin from monolysocardiolipin occurs via the Barth Syndrome gene product tafazzin and acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 and the alpha subunit of trifunctional protein. We conclude that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant prevents cardiac dysfunction induced by tafazzin gene knockdown in cardiac myocytes and suggest mito-Tempo as a potential therapeutic for Barth syndrome and other dilated cardiomyopathies resulting from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Here, we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ).

58cd90c202b8c60953000040	What is the role of IL-18BP?	Interleukin 18--binding protein ameliorates liver ischemia--reperfusion injury.  IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective effects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme activities and cytokine levels.  Because of IL-18's potential pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive effects, its biological activities are tightly controlled in the body by its naturally occurring antagonist called IL-18BP. The antagonist is produced in the body both constitutively and in response to an increased production of IL-18 as a negative feedback mechanism. Under physiological conditions, most of IL-18 in the circulation is bound with IL-18BP and is inactive. However, an imbalance in the production of IL-18 and its antagonist (an increase in the production of IL-18 with a decrease, no increase or an insufficient increase in the production of IL-18BP) has been described in many chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. L-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.  Platelets also contain the IL-18 antagonist, the IL-18-Binding Protein (IL-18BP) The natural inhibitor IL-18BP , whose production is enhanced by IFN-γ and IL-27, further regulates IL-18 activity in the extracellular environment.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-18.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.

5ac37afc0340b9f058000002	What type of sequences do enhancers evolve from?	The sequences of some gene regulatory elements diverge considerably, even between closely related species.  The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes.  These studies have identified enhancers that were pivotal for morphological divergence and highlighted how novel genetic networks shaping form emerged from pre-existing ones.

5c72f5247c78d6947100007e	Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?	Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene. Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Exome sequencing revealed a novel biallelic deletion in the DCAF17 gene underlying Woodhouse Sakati syndrome. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements.  The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that was first described in 1983. Since its original description, approximately 50 cases have been reported with various clinical signs and symptoms.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. Despite identical genetic alteration, our 5 patients had various clinical features among them and compared with previously reported cases with the same pathogenic mutation.  The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene.	['DCAF17']

514a0a57d24251bc05000051	Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?	Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is widely used as an antidote in comatose patients suspected of having ingested a benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of sedation from benzodiazepines administered during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and during induction or maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for benzodiazepine overdose. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. A 54-y-old man ingested 2 g of bulk laboratory diazepam and was treated with activated charcoal, enhanced diuresis and flumazenil infusion. Flumazenil is a specific and competitive antagonist at the central benzodiazepine receptor, reversing all effects of benzodiazepine agonists without tranquillising or anticonvulsant actions. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic conscious sedation has not been defined. To develop clinical rules for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Flumazenil is best left for reversal of therapeutic conscious sedation and rare select cases of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. It improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17 patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and 58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful in reversing the sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants. The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). The efficacy and safety of flumazenil were assessed in comparison to placebo in a double-blind randomised study of 31 adults intoxicated with benzodiazepines. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation, and orientation in time and space. Patients who received flumazenil awoke within minutes but central depression returned partly one hour later, which reflects the short elimination half-life of the drug. Side effects were few and the results indicate that flumazenil is effective in the primary management of benzodiazepine overdose and in states where benzodiazepines have been taken with other drugs. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of unknown origin.	['flumazenil']

Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines: a Data and Tool Resource to Study Transcriptional Regulation of GABAergic Cell Fate. Elucidating the transcriptional circuitry controlling forebrain development requires an understanding of enhancer activity and regulation. We generated stable transgenic mouse lines that express CreERT2and GFP from ten different enhancer elements with activity in distinct domains within the embryonic basal ganglia. We used these unique tools to generate a comprehensive regional fate map of the mouse subpallium, including sources for specific subtypes of amygdala neurons. We then focused on deciphering transcriptional mechanisms that control enhancer activity. Using machine-learning computations, in vivo chromosomal occupancy of 13 transcription factors that regulate subpallial patterning and differentiation and analysis of enhancer activity in Dlx1/2 and Lhx6 mutants, we elucidated novel molecular mechanisms that regulate region-specific enhancer activity in the developing brain. Thus, these subpallial enhancer transgenic lines are data and tool resources to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.

58b56fe422d3005309000007	Where do the Schwann cells and melanocytes originate from?	The development of the nervous system involves cells remaining within the neural tube (CNS) and a group of cells that delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo called neural crest cells (NCC). These cells are a mesenchymal highly migratory group of cells that give rise to a wide variety of cell derivatives: melanocytes, sensory neurons, bone, Schwann cells, etc.  Cell types with neural crest ancestry consequently comprise a number of specialized varieties, such as ectodermal neurons, melanocytes and Schwann cells, as well as mesodermal osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells.  Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types.  Later, SoxE proteins drive the formation of multiple neural crest derivatives including chondrocytes, melanocytes, and cells of the peripheral nervous system, particularly Schwann cells/peripheral glia.  Melanocytes and Schwann cells are derived from the multipotent population of neural crest cells. The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells. Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types Furthermore, although both populations are initially part of the Foxd3 lineage, hypaxial melanocytes lose Foxd3 at late stages upon separation from the nerve, whereas we recently found that epaxial melanocytes segregate earlier from Foxd3-positive neural progenitors while still residing in the dorsal neural tube.  Reversal of developmental restrictions in neural crest lineages: transition from Schwann cells to glial-melanocytic precursors in vitro. Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme. Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances. Other already committed cells are the angioblasts forming the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, the neural crest cells differentiating into melanocytes and Schwann cells, and the blood-derived cells like chrondro- or osteoclasts. The dorsal neural tube first generates neural crest cells that exit the neural primordium following an epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion to become sympathetic ganglia, Schwann cells, dorsal root sensory ganglia, and melanocytes of the skin. We show here that neural crest cells arising from the neural tube located at the level of somites 47-53 can differentiate both in vitro and in vivo into melanocytes and Schwann cells but not into neurons. This capacity may be due to the common origin of Schwann cells and melanocytes in the neural crest. Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves. In the vertebrate embryo, multiple cell types originate from a common structure, the neural crest (NC), which forms at the dorsal tips of the neural epithelium.	['neural crest cells', 'NCC']

513ce5f2bee46bd34c00000a	Which is the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the human population?	The allelic frequency of this variant was calculated to be 0.7% for this population The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98 The age related prevalence of CF among the South Asian and general populations was: 0-14 years, 1:9200 versus 1:6600; 15-24 years, 1:13,200 versus 1:7600; older than 25 years, 1:56,600 versus 1:12,400. A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. However, our data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants) CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals.

534427f8aeec6fbd07000009	Are most driver gene mutations synonymous or non-synonymous?	Therefore, this study highlights the need for multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of expressed driver mutations. Whole genome sequencing of the index liver metastasis identified 44 non-synonymous somatic mutations in 42 genes (0.85 mutation/MB) and a large hemizygous deletion in the ATRX gene which has been recently reported in neuroblastoma. In addition, we show that NetDiseaseSNP discriminates cancer driver and passenger mutations satisfactorily. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several disease/neutral datasets as well as on cancer driver/passenger mutation datasets and can thus be used to pinpoint and prioritize plausible disease candidates among nsSNPs for further investigation. Moreover, we find that a large fraction of the driver mutations are neither located in conserved functional sites, nor responsible for structural stability, but rather regulate protein activity through allosteric transitions, protein-protein interactions, or protein-nucleic acid interactions. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify novel non-synonymous somatic mutations in squamous cell lung cancer. We identified 101 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) including 77 non-synonymous SNVs (67 missense and 10 nonsense mutations) and 11 INDELs causing frameshifts. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways). A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency.	['non-synonymous']

5e355e20fbd6abf43b000065	Which gene is frequently involved in autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD)?	An LMNB1 Duplication Caused Adult-Onset Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy in Chinese Family: Clinical Manifestations, Neuroradiology and Genetic Diagnosis. Duplication or over expression of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene causes ADLD. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive clinical evaluation and genetic detection for a Chinese family with ADLD. The proband is a 52-year old man manifested with autonomic abnormalities, pyramidal tract dysfunction. MRI brain scan identified bilateral symmetric white matter (WM) hyper-intensities in periventricular and semi-oval WM, cerebral peduncles and middle cerebellar peduncles. The proband has a positive autosomal dominant family history with similar clinical manifestations with a trend of genetic anticipation. In order to understand the genetic cause of the disease in this family, target exome capture based next generation sequencing has been done, but no causative variants or possibly pathogenic variants has been identified. However, Multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) showed whole duplication of LMNB1 gene which is co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family. This is the first genetically confirmed LMNB1 associated ADLD pedigree from China. Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. However, as only a few cases have been analyzed in detail, the mechanisms underlying LMNB1 duplications are unclear. We report the detailed molecular analysis of the largest collection of ADLD families studied, to date. We have identified the minimal duplicated region necessary for the disease, defined all the duplication junctions at the nucleotide level and identified the first inverted LMNB1 duplication. Duplication of the LMNB1 gene is the genetic cause of ADLD, yet the pathogenetic mechanism is not defined. In this study, we analysed cells and muscle tissue from three patients affected by ADLD, carrying an extra copy of the LMNB1 gene. Adult-onset autosomal-dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder characterized by early autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, pyramidal tract and cerebellar dysfunction, and white matter loss in the central nervous system. ADLD is caused by duplication of the LMNB1 gene, which results in increased lamin B1 transcripts and protein expression. How duplication of LMNB1 leads to myelin defects is unknown.  Lamin B1 duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy. ADLD is associated with duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene but the mechanism by which the rearrangement conveys the phenotype is not fully defined. We analyzed four unrelated families segregating ADLD with autonomic symptoms for duplications of the LMNB1 gene. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed novel duplications spanning the entire LMNB1 gene in probands from each of the four families. We then analyzed the expression of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes by Western blot analysis in five patients from two available families. The protein levels of lamin B1 were found significantly increased. These results indicate that the ADLD phenotype associated with LMNB1 duplications is mediated by increased levels of the lamin B1 protein. Furthermore, we show that a molecular diagnosis for ADLD with autonomic symptoms can be obtained by a direct analysis of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes. Genomic duplications mediate overexpression of lamin B1 in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) with autonomic symptoms.

Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ). Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene.  Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder , is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein , lamin B1 , and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene.  As a proof-of-concept , we studied autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) due to lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) duplication , a hereditary , progressive and fatal disorder affecting myelin in the CNS.  We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease.  Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination .  Duplication or over expression of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene causes ADLD .  Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. However, we previously reported an ADLD family (ADLD-1-TO) without evidence of duplication or other mutation in LMNB1 despite linkage to the LMNB1 locus and lamin B1 overexpression. Through parallel studies, we investigated both loss of genetic material and chromosomal rearrangement as possible causes of LMNB1 overexpression, and found that ADLD-1-TO plausibly results from an enhancer adoption mechanism. Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder, is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein, lamin B1, and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene. Objective To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 (LMNB1). ABSTRACT Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Duplications of lamin B1 (LMNB1) at 5q23 are implicated in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) having been described in six families with diverse ethnic background but with a homogeneous phenotype. INTRODUCTION: adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare inherited disorder due to a duplication of lamin-B1 (LMNB1) gene. While at least a dozen disorders are associated with LMNA, the focus of this review is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), the only disease associated with the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1).

5cb0d647ecadf2e73f000059	What is a exposome?	The interaction between the (epi)genetic makeup of an individual and his/her environmental exposure record (exposome) is accepted as a determinant factor for a significant proportion of human malignancies. The high-throughput and holistic approaches to biomarker discovery used extensively in large-scale molecular epidemiological exposome are also discussed in the context of human exposure to environmental stressors Experimental data strongly suggests a complex interaction between the exposome (or environmental influences) and genome (genetic material) to produce epigenetic changes (epigenome) Exposome factors including nutrition, medication, occupational factors, pollutants, climatic factors, and psychosocial and lifestyle factors may impact on the course and severity of acne and on treatment efficacy  The exposome is a novel conceptual framework that allows for concurrent examination of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including environmental exposures, as well as changes in exposures over time, to elucidate the complex environmental factors that affect health outcomes.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000012	Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?	We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.  Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0.05). Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients.  Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized.  Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%).  Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient.  Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron.  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain.  All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases.  Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease. Restless leg syndrome manifested by iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis. Diurnal effects on motor control are evident in the human disease of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), which is purported to be linked to brain iron deficiency as well as alterations in dopaminergic systems.  Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome.  Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy.  Clinical, EEG, electromyographic and polysomnographic studies in restless legs syndrome caused by magnesium deficiency. A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.	['iron']

The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings.  Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the independent prognostic factors were Karnofsky Performance Status score ≤70, splenium involvement, and butterfly glioblastoma. Canine Butterfly Glioblastomas: A Neuroradiological Review. All tumors demonstrated classical histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), including glial cell pseudopalisading, serpentine necrosis, microvascular proliferation as well as invasion of the corpus callosum by neoplastic astrocytes. Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Mimicking Butterfly Glioblastoma: A Rare Presentation in the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum. BACKGROUND: Intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland is rare, and metastatic ACC to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma (GBM) has not been reported previously. Diverse molecular pattern in a bihemispheric glioblastoma (butterfly glioma) in a 16-year-old boy. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor of adults, is relatively rare in children. In a GBM affecting a 16-year-old boy, the tumor spread across the corpus callosum (butterfly glioma).  The original "clearcut" diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme, based on CT scans, was unexpectedly disproved by examination of stereotactically obtained brain biopsy specimens, which revealed a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kufs' disease).  The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings. In addition to a large butterfly glioblastoma originating from the frontal part of the corpus callosum, neuropathologic examination revealed a mycotic encephalitis with formation of numerous fungi-containing inflammatory foci in all parts of the brain and in the glioma. Corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): butterfly glioma. When a tumor with adenoid histological features and a "butterfly" phenotype grows in the corpus callosum in a patient with known parotid ACC, both metastasis and adenoid variant GBM should be considered. In a GBM affecting a 16-year-old boy, the tumor spread across the corpus callosum (butterfly glioma). BACKGROUND Intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland is rare, and metastatic ACC to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma (GBM) has not been reported previously. the pathologies implicate the bilateral corpus callosum that builds the butterfly pattern on axial view these tumors have seldom been investigated for both clinical

subgroup further molecular investigation is preferable to explore genetic variations associated with these tumors. a 45 year old male with a butterfly glioma received stereotactic biopsy for histologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis microscopically the results were controversial since some biopsy specimens showed distinct inflammatory changes while others displayed typical features of a malignant glioma the patient died four days after the stereotactic approach due to therapy resistant intracranial pressure rise in addition to a large butterfly glioblastoma originating from the frontal part of the corpus callosum neuropathologic examination revealed a mycotic encephalitis with formation of numerous fungi containing inflammatory foci in all parts of the brain and in the glioma general autopsy disclosed pulmonary aspergillosis as the source of the inflammatory spread a previous steroid medication over several weeks for treatment of increased intracranial pressure may be considered as an important factor in the origin of the pulmonary aspergillosis complicating the butterfly glioma. clinics in diagnostic imaging 175 corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme gbm butterfly glioma a 54 year old man presented with change in behaviour nocturnal enuresis abnormal limb movement and headache of one week s duration the diagnosis of butterfly glioma glioblastoma

crosses the corpus callosum is suggestive of an aggressive neoplasm other neoplastic and non neoplastic conditions that may involve the corpus callosum and mimic a butterfly glioma as well as associated imaging features are discussed. intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma acc of the parotid gland is rare and metastatic acc to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma gbm has not been reported previously we report a rare case of metastasis to the splenium of the corpus callosum from acc of the parotid gland the tumor occupied the splenium and mimicked the presentation of a butterfly glioma the patient had undergone parotidectomy 5 years before presentation with this intracranial lesion on magnetic resonance imaging the lesion was separate from the pineal gland and displaced the internal cerebral veins downward ventricular obstruction and increased cellularity were also suggested and multiple fluid filled cystic spaces were observed the tumor was partially resected because the extreme lateral boundary could not be visualized histological analysis with anti c kit antibody showed strong expression of the epithelial component immunohistochemistry with anti p63 antibody revealed nests of positive tumor cells highlighting the myoepithelial component the tumor also stained positive for anti myb antibody the treatment for this lesion is surgical debulking followed by radiation therapy however the overall prognosis remains grim because of limited chemotherapy options and a propensity for recurrence in both local and distant fashions when a tumor with adenoid histological features and a butterfly phenotype grows in the corpus callosum in a patient with known parotid acc both metastasis and adenoid variant gbm should be considered careful clinical and radiological correlation is required to diagnose and treat this rare lesion. the authors report a case of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis kufs disease confirmed by stereotactically obtained brain biopsy findings and initially diagnosed as a butterfly glioma the presenting symptoms in the 64 year old patient were mental alterations with progressive dementia followed by muscular atrophy and myoclonia with distal preponderance the mild initial disturbances of coordination increased and the patient developed a markedly ataxic gait computerized tomography ct scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed generalized cerebral atrophy and a bifrontal space occupying lesion involving the callosum the original clearcut diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme based on ct scans was unexpectedly disproved by examination of stereotactically obtained brain biopsy specimens which revealed a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis kufs disease to the authors knowledge

5a95765bfcd1d6a10c000028	What part of what body organ controls the circadian clock?	the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus acts as the central clock in mammals, the circadian expression of clock genes  In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus orchestrates daily rhythms of physiology and behavior in mammals.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus houses the central circadian clock and is characterized by the timely regulated expression of clock genes. Clock genes control circadian rhythms both centrally, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain and peripherally, within every organ of the body. The mammalian circadian system consists of a central oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which coordinates peripheral clocks in organs throughout the body. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied,   In mammals, a master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, adjusts timing of other self-sustained oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs. Circadian clocks are endogenous and biological oscillations that occur with a period of<24 h. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is linked to peripheral tissues through neural and hormonal signals.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls circadian rhythms in mammals The environmental light-dark (LD) cycle entrains the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mammals. Although circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior are dependent upon a biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the molecular mechanism of this clock is in fact cell autonomous and conserved in nearly all cells of the body. The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a central pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsidiary oscillators in nearly all body cells. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain is the circadian center, relaying rhythmic environmental and behavioral information to peripheral tissues to control circadian physiology.

52efbfccc8da898910000018	At which kind of individuals is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?	sHT in older people should be not regarded as a unique condition, and moderately old patients (aged <70-75 y) could be considered clinically similar to the adult population, albeit with a higher optimal TSH target value. Conversely, the oldest old subjects should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. An appropriately powered randomized controlled trial of levothyroxine in SCH examining vascular outcomes is now warranted. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. Sustained normalization of thyroid function during l-T(4) replacement therapy significantly decreases baPWV in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with autoimmune chronic thyroiditis, suggesting the improvement of arterial stiffening and, consequently, possible prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest that L-T(4) replacement therapy may be especially beneficial in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with high baseline baPWV and pulse pressure. The beneficial effects of L-T(4) replacement therapy in decreasing arterial stiffening and thus preventing cardiovascular disease might be limited to this sub-population. Although a consensus is still lacking, the strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of levothyroxine replacement on markers of cardiovascular risk is the substantial demonstration that restoration of euthyroidism can lower both total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. Restoration of euthyroidism by levothyroxine (LT4) treatment may correct the lipid profile and cardiac abnormalities, especially in patients with an initially higher deviation from normality and higher serum TSH levels. Importantly, a strong association between SH and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, independent of the traditional risk factors, has been recently reported in a large cross-sectional survey (the Rotterdam Study). However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy.

55032efde9bde69634000035	Which receptor is targeted by telcagepant?	In vivo quantification of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor occupancy by telcagepant in rhesus monkey and human brain using the positron emission tomography tracer [11C]MK-4232. Lack of hemodynamic interaction between CGRP-receptor antagonist telcagepant (MK-0974) and sumatriptan: results from a randomized study in patients with migraine. Olcegepant is the first selective CGRP receptor antagonist of proven efficacy in migraine. Olcegepant could only be administered intravenously and never taken beyond Phase II. Telcagepant is orally available and several completed Phase III trials have revealed positive results.  Telcagepant (MK-0974) is a novel calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist currently undergoing clinical trials for migraine (http://www.merck.com/research/pipeline/home.html). Four chemically unrelated CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) antagonists (olcegepant, telcagepant, MK-3207 and BI 44370 TA) have displayed efficacy in the treatment of migraine.  Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being evaluated for acute migraine treatment.  BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, such as telcagepant, may be useful for acute migraine treatment in patients with cardiovascular disease, a population for whom triptans are contraindicated. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (gepants)-olcegepant (BIBN 4096 BS), telcagepant (MK-0974), MK3207, and BI 44370 TA-are effective in treating acute migraine.  Telcagepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine.  The potent calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, telcagepant, does not affect nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation in healthy men. AIMS: To assess the effect of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on the haemodynamic response to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG).  BACKGROUND: Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine.  BACKGROUND: The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists olcegepant and telcagepant are very potent drugs.  CONCLUSION: The apparently high doses of CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and telcagepant needed for anti-migraine effect are not so high after all.  Dose-response curves for headaches relief and adverse events (AEs) are presented for five triptans: sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan, and the CGRP antagonist telcagepant. INTRODUCTION: Telcagepant (MK-0974) is a novel, orally active and selective CGRP receptor antagonist being investigated for acute treatment of migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are another promising nonvasoconstrictor approach to treating acute migraine. Olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK-0974) have been shown to be safe and effective in phase I, II, and (for telcagepant) phase III clinical trials.  Background.- Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being investigated for the acute treatment of migraine. In 3 randomized clinical trials (n = 1585) the calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist telcagepant 300 mg orally had an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo when used in the acute treatment of migraine.  BACKGROUND: Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist with acute antimigraine efficacy comparable to oral triptans METHODS: This study evaluated the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant (tablet formulation) for treatment of a migraine attack and across four attacks. A highly efficient, asymmetric synthesis of telcagepant (1), a CGRP receptor antagonist for the treatment of migraine, is described Asymmetric synthesis of telcagepant, a CGRP receptor antagonist for the treatment of migraine. Sustained pain freedom and no adverse events as an endpoint in clinical trials of acute migraine treatments: application to patient-level data from a trial of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, and zolmitriptan. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate new composite efficacy-plus-tolerability endpoints based on a post-hoc analysis of patient-level data from a previous randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, and zolmitriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Effect of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant in human cranial arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide morphological and functional data on the presence of CGRP receptors in cerebral and meningeal arteries, which illustrates a possible site of action of telcagepant in the treatment of migraine. Characterization of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist telcagepant (MK-0974) in human isolated coronary arteries. We therefore investigated the effects of the antimigraine CGRP receptor antagonist telcagepant (MK-0974) [N-[(3R,6S)-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)azepan-3-yl]-4-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxamide] on human isolated coronary arteries.  These findings in vitro support the cardiovascular safety of CGRP receptor antagonists and suggest that telcagepant is unlikely to induce coronary side effects under normal cardiovascular conditions. Towards this end, the non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists olcegepant and telcagepant have been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine. While telcagepant is being pursued as a frontline abortive migraine drug in a phase III clinical trial, an oral formulation of a novel CGRP receptor antagonist, BI 44370, is currently in phase II clinical trials. Telcagepant represents a new class of antimigraine drug-the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers.  The CGRP receptor antagonists telcagepant and olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of migraine and there is now a need to better understand how these molecules interact with the receptor.  Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and tolerability of telcagepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, in adults. Telcagepant is a novel, orally active, and selective calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist being developed for acute treatment of migraine with and without aura.  Studies were conducted in human isolated coronary arteries to explore the vascular effects of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant and to compare its coronary vasoconstrictive potential to that of zolmitriptan.  Intravenous BIBN4096BS (olcegepant) and oral MK-0974 (telcagepant), two CGRP-receptor antagonists, were safe and effective in the treatment of migraine attacks in Phase I and II trials.  Telcagepant (MK-0974) is a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist and is currently under clinical development.	['calcitonin gene-related peptide']
5ab147edfcf4565872000013	The Mantoux test detects what latent infection/disease?	screened for TB infection with a Mantoux tuberculin skin test  The present study reports the results of a three-year TB surveillance among HCW in a large teaching hospital in Rome, using TST (by standard Mantoux technique) Laboratory diagnostic testing of cellular immunity against pathogenic mycobacteria employs the tuberculin skin test (TST, Mantoux tuberculin test)  tuberculin skin test (TST) performed according to the Mantoux method.  Diaskintest® test and Mantoux test with 2TE PPD-L were concurrently carried out in 300 children and adolescents with tuberculosis and followed up in risk groups at a tuberculosis dispensary to determine the sensitivity of the new skin test in active tuberculosis infection. Latent tuberculosis treatment was recommended in all Mantoux-positive contacts. The prevalence of tuberculosis infection among hospitalized patients in a pneumological department of an inner-city hospital was evaluated, using the intradermal tuberculin skin test (Mantoux technique).  he 100-year-old tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) has been the only available diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection, despite its many well-known limitations. In order to determine the prevalence of latent infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in drug users and to provide centres for drug users with a practical tool for tuberculosis screening, 237 drug users were subjected to the Monotest and, for reference purposes, to the Mantoux test.

550c4011a103b78016000009	Which residue of alpha-synuclein was found to be phosphorylated in Lewy bodies?	Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (S129) is highly elevated in Parkinson's disease patients where it mainly accumulates in the Lewy bodies Approximately 90% of α-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% or less of total α-syn is phosphorylated at this residue in the normal brain. This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies. These inclusion bodies are the characteristic pathologic lesions of Parkinson disease Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies. �-Synuclein is causative for autosomal dominant familial Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the phosphorylation of �-synuclein at residue Ser-129 is a key posttranslational modification detected in Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies lesions. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions. alpha-Synuclein is a major protein component deposited in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that is extensively phosphorylated at Ser(129), although its role in neuronal degeneration is still elusive. These observations are most consistent with a model in which preferential accumulation of normally produced Ser-129 phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is the key event responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies in various Lewy body diseases. The predominant modification of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies is a single phosphorylation at Ser-129. Approximately 90% of Î±-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated Î±-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies	['Serine 129']
515dd3d5298dcd4e5100001c	In what proportion of children with heart failure has Enalapril been shown to be safe and effective?	The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year Patients with intraatrial baffle procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have diastolic dysfunction, decreased exercise capacity, stroke volume response and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed. A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function. Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure. Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure. Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery. Renal failure was a problem in young infants with left-to-right shunts. In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril. The median age was 5.4 months. All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%. Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3). Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome. The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0.30 (0.21) mg/kg/day. Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril. We studied the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in eight infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics, treated orally with 0.25 mg kg-1 enalapril maleate once a day In infants with CHF, mean baseline ACE activity was significantly higher than in control infants Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit "heart failure" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.

55201a316b348bb82c000019	What is the sedimentation coefficient of the mammalian mitoribosome?	 The mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (55S) The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) has a highly protein-rich composition with a small sedimentation coefficient of 55 S, consisting of 39 S large and 28 S small subunits. The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (referred to hereafter as "mitoribosome") is protein-rich, containing nearly twice as much protein as the Escherichia coli ribosome.  59 of 78 proteins of the 55S mitoribosome, several TIM and TOM proteins and cell death proteins were present. The sedimentation coefficient of the intact monosome was about 55 S.  Though the nematode mitoribosome has a larger size than the bacterial ribosome, it does not differ significantly in size from mammalian mitoribosomes. The mammalian mitochondrial (mt) ribosome (mitoribosome) is a bacterial-type ribosome but has a highly protein-rich composition.	['55 S']

5e5e502a1af46fc13000000a	What receptor is associated with the protein encoded by the Spätzle gene?	 In Drosophila, apoptotic elimination of the weaker "loser" cells from growing wing discs is induced by a signaling module consisting of the Toll ligand Spätzle (Spz), several Toll-related receptors, and NF-κB factors The Drosophila Toll-1 receptor is involved in embryonic development, innate immunity, and tissue homeostasis. Currently, as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor, only Spätzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The ligand for the Toll receptor is thought to be spätzle (spz), a secreted protein that is activated by proteolytic cleavage. Spätzle protein is an extracellular ligand of Toll receptor in Toll signaling pathway involved in the embryonic dorsoventral patterning and in the innate immunity. spätzle acts immediately upstream of the membrane protein Toll in the genetic pathway, suggesting that spätzle could encode the ventrally localized ligand that activates the receptor activity of Toll. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The canonical Toll receptor (Toll-1) is activated by the cytokine Spätzle (Spz-1), but Drosophila encodes eight other Toll genes and five other Spz genes whose interactions with one another and associated functions are less well-understood.

5a8712af61bb38fb24000002	What is the link between psoriatic arthritis and depression	Depression Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Psoriatic Arthritis among Patients with Psoriasis merging data also suggest associations between psoriasis and other comorbidities beyond psoriatic arthritis, including chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic disease, certain malignancies, infections, and mood disorders. Do depression and anxiety reduce the likelihood of remission in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis? To investigate the predictive value of baseline depression/anxiety on the likelihood of achieving joint remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as well as the associations between baseline depression/anxiety and the components of the remission criteria at follow-up. Rate of depression was higher in patients with PsA compared to non-PsA patients. The rate of suicidal behaviors was similar between the two cohorts. Over the past decade, multiple studies have shown that not only is there an association between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, depression, and substance abuse, but psoriasis patients also have a higher incidence of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Psoriasis is a chronic disease that affects more than the skin. It has an impact on every facet of an individual's life and is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, depression, anxiety and other immune-related conditions, such as Crohn's disease.  We found an increased risk of depression in US women with psoriasis compared with those without psoriasis.  The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of varianc Furthermore, obesity and psychological diseases such as depression and anxiety disorders are linked with psoriasis and play a central role in its management.  Recommendations were synthesized into 19 final recommendations ranging mainly from grade C to D, and relating to a large spectrum of comorbidities observed in clinical practice: CVD, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, infections, and cancer. Level of agreement ranged from 80.9% to 95.8%.CONCLUSION: These practical evidence-based recommendations can guide management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO and optimize outcome Anxiety and depressive symptoms and illness perceptions in psoriatic arthritis and associations with physical health-related quality of life.  The rate of depression and anxiety is significantly higher in patients with PsA than in those with PsC. Depression and anxiety are associated with disease-related factors. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the prevalence of depression symptoms are high among patients suffering psoriatic arthritis in the studied population. Psoriasis (Pso) is a common chronic cutaneous inflammatory disease involving the skin that is associated with serious comorbidities. Comorbidities in Pso include psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reduced quality of life, malignancy, depression, but also a constellation of associated conditions that enhance the cardiovascular (CV) risk.  Dermatologists and primary care providers share roles in screening for associated comorbidities (including cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney disease, Crohn disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, depression, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis),	['comorbidity']

Epizootic congenital abnormalities, encephalomyelitis and febrile illnesses in cattle caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are prevalent in Japan  Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by mosquitoes.  Nine different arboviruses are known to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses) are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks Arboviruses are transmitted among vertebrates by biting insects, chiefly mosquitoes and ticks Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida) Mosquito-transmitted arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and West Nile virus constitute a major public health burden and are increasing in severity and frequency worldwide. Malaria and Japanese encephalitis are the two most serious human diseases transmitted by riceland mosquitoes, but they have been incriminated as vectors of dozens of arboviruses and other parasites and pathogens including the causal agents of West Nile and Rift Valley Fevers and lymphatic filariasis. Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida). Many of them are transmitted by insects (arboviruses, e.g. yellow fever virus) or by rodents (e.g. Hanta viruses), others by contact with patients and nosocomial infections (e.g. Ebola virus). Arboviruses - viruses transmitted by haematophagous arthropods - are responsible for febrile syndromes, which sometimes include haemorrhagic or neurological symptoms. Arboviruses are transmitted to vertebral hosts during blood feedings by mosquitoes, ticks, biting flies, mites, and nits. Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes are a major cause of human disease worldwide. Diseases caused by arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, continue to rise in annual incidence and geographic expansion. Arboviruses transmitted by ticks must adapt to the peculiar physiological and behavioral characteristics of ticks, particularly with regard to blood feeding, bloodmeal digestion, and molting. The last decade has seen significant changes in the epidemiology of arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, particularly in relation to the intercontinental spread of Aedes albopictus. This technique enables the detection of 70 of the 80 arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes in Africa and very easily detects arbovirus associations by using either monospecific or monoclonal immune ascitic fluids (dengue-1-2-3-4 and yellow fever viruses) used in the indirect immunofluorescence technique..

5545e65bd355485447000001	Patients of which disease could be treated by utilizing knowledge obtained from experiments suppressing TDP-43 toxicity in yeast?	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS	['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)']

5e49c2356d0a277941000010	Which database exists that contains regulatory SNPs which affect predicted transcription factor binding site affinity?	SNP2TFBS - a database of regulatory SNPs affecting predicted transcription factor binding site affinity. SNP2TFBS is a computational resource intended to support researchers investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in the human genome. The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor. These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive SNP catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual SNP, to extract SNPs based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of SNPs or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected SNPs.

571f5c150fd6f91b68000009	Which protein is found to be mutated in Friedreich's ataxia?	It is generally accepted that Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a deficiency in frataxin expression, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, which mainly affects the brain, dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, heart and in certain cases the pancreas Friedreich's ataxia is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased expression of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein that stimulates iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis In eukaryotes, frataxin deficiency (FXN) causes severe phenotypes including loss of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster protein activity, accumulation of mitochondrial iron and leads to the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia Complete absence of frataxin, the mitochondrial protein defective in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, is lethal in C. elegans, while its partial deficiency extends animal lifespan in a p53 dependent manner. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Friedreich's ataxia results from a deficiency in the mitochondrial protein frataxin, which carries single point mutations in some patients. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cardio- and neurodegenerative disease, is caused by low expression of frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein, encoded in the nucleus. The severe reduction in mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, encoded by the X25 gene, causes Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive hereditary ataxia. Assembly and iron-binding properties of human frataxin, the protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia is a human neurodegenerative and myocardial disease caused by decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, is caused by abnormally low levels of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease caused by a deficiency of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein of unknown function. This review will focus on the progress of potential treatment strategies for Friedreich ataxia that target the GAA expanded gene and seek to increase the level of frataxin message and protein. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and which is associated with abnormal intramitochondrial iron handling The neurodegenerative disorder FRDA (Friedreich&apos;s ataxia) results from a deficiency in frataxin, a putative iron chaperone, and is due to the presence of a high number of GAA repeats in the coding regions of both alleles of the frataxin gene, which impair protein expression The Friedreich's ataxia protein frataxin modulates DNA base excision repair in prokaryotes and mammals. It is caused by deficiency of frataxin, a highly conserved nuclear-encoded protein localized in mitochondria. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Interestingly, Drosophila frataxin (dfh), which causes Friedreich's ataxia if mutated in humans, displayed an interacting effect with Al, suggesting Friedreich's ataxia patients might be more susceptible to Al toxicity. Although the Friedreich's ataxia phenotype results from decreased expression of a mitochondrially targeted protein, frataxin, mitochondrial myopathy has not been described as a feature of the disease.

5e4940f46d0a277941000004	How many annotated conserved human lncRNAs come from ancestral protein-coding genes?	These lncRNAs have specific characteristics, such as broader expression domains, that set them apart from other lncRNAs. Fourteen lncRNAs have sequence similarity with the loci of the contemporary homologs of the lost protein-coding genes. We propose that selection acting on enhancer sequences is mostly responsible for retention of these regions. As an example of an RNA element from a protein-coding ancestor that was retained in the lncRNA, we describe in detail a short translated ORF in the JPX lncRNA that was derived from an upstream ORF in a protein-coding gene and retains some of its functionality.CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that ~ 55 annotated conserved human lncRNAs are derived from parts of ancestral protein-coding genes, and loss of coding potential is thus a non-negligible source of new lncRNAs. Some lncRNAs inherited regulatory elements influencing transcription and translation from their protein-coding ancestors and those elements can influence the expression breadth and functionality of these lncRNAs.

516e5f10298dcd4e5100007c	Is cancer related to global DNA hypo or hypermethylation?	Regions of focal DNA hypermethylation and long-range hypomethylation in colorectal cancer Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation Comparison of CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation in premalignant stages of gastric cancer CpG island hypermethylation and genomic DNA hypomethylation are found not only in gastric cancers but also in associated premalignant lesions Methylation of repetitive DNA elements in gastric lesions generally decreased with progression of the gastric lesion along the multistep carcinogenesi our findings suggest that CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation are enhanced with progression of the gastric lesion DNA hypomethylation arises later in prostate cancer progression than CpG island hypermethylation Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA was one of the first somatic epigenetic alterations discovered in human cancers. DNA hypomethylation is postulated to occur very early in almost all human cancers, perhaps facilitating genetic instability and cancer initiation and progression. Contrary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all human cancers, we show that reductions in (5me)C content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a significant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease These findings provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation changes occur later in prostate carcinogenesis than the CpG island hypermethylation changes and occur heterogeneously during prostate cancer progression and metastatic dissemination. revealed a high incidence of hypermethylation only in poorly differentiated (early and late) tumors. In contrast to gene hypermethylation, genomic DNA hypomethylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive elements and loss of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, occurred in both early and late stages of prostate cancer. Tumors have reduced levels of genomic DNA methylation and contain hypermethylated CpG islands The results are consistent with a specific defect in methylation of repetitive DNA sequences in human cancer. Both hypomethylation and hypermethylation in a 0.2-kb region of a DNA repeat in cancer Differential DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation signatures in colorectal cancer Cancer cells are characterized by a generalized disruption of the DNA methylation pattern involving an overall decrease in the level of 5-methylcytosine together with regional hypermethylation of particular CpG islands We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression	['Global hypomethylation is coupled with focal hypermethylation at CpG islands']
56c5c7915795f9a73e000004	Where does CTCF colocalize with cohesin?	In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.  In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.  Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels. Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.   To determine the functional importance of the binding of CTCF and cohesins at the three imprinted loci, CTCF and cohesins were depleted in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Results of these experiments demonstrate an unappreciated role for CTCF and cohesins in the repression of imprinted genes in somatic cells. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We conclude that cohesin subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene regulation and chromatin organization. Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Here, we show that ATRX, MeCP2, and cohesin, chromatin regulators implicated in ATR-X, RTT, and CdLS syndromes, respectively, interact in the brain and colocalize at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) with preferential binding on the maternal allele. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle.  ChIP sequencing was performed on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at ~60 sites throughout the V(H) region and 2 other sites within the Igh locus.  Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus.  CTCF colocalizes with cohesin but not RNA Polymerase II.

56c048acef6e39474100001c	Which enzyme is inhibited by Imetelstat?	The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.  Telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L) limits the lifespan of human pancreatic cancer cells. GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase.  We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and phosphorylation of TP53. The activity of imetelstat as a single agent suggests that further studies of telomerase inhibitors in combination with other agents may be warranted.  Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of telomerase inhibition on proliferation and tumorigenicity in established cell lines (BXD-1425EPN, R254), a primary TIC line (E520) and xenograft models of pediatric ependymoma.  PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase.  Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Imetelstat inhibited proliferation and self-renewal by shortening telomeres and inducing senescence in vitro. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. The GBM tumor-initiating cells were treated with imetelstat and examined for the effects on telomerase activity levels, telomere length, proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation. We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT. This enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not in the majority of normal somatic cells. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.  Telomerase antagonist imetelstat inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth and increases radiation-induced DNA breaks. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential.  When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells.  Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer.  In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs.  Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.  BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity.  Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis.  Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. 	['telomerase']
5a86e6fafaa1ab7d2e000036	What is the nucleotide composition of the Lamin Associated Domains (LADs)?	Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence. In metazoans, the nuclear lamina is thought to play an important role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment.

5a804f71faa1ab7d2e00001d	Which algorithm is used for detection of long repeat expansions?	Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.

53189656b166e2b80600001c	Against which protein is the antibody used for immonostaining of Lewy bodies raised?	α-Synuclein is the major protein associated with Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. With the aim to develop antibodies showing high specificity and sensitivity for disease-associated α-synuclein, synthetic peptides containing different amino acid sequences were used for immunization of mice. Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are very frequent neurological disorders of the elderly. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) gene cause Parkinson's disease, often associated with dementia. Neuropathologically these diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils. Immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%). We immunohistochemically investigated the degeneration processes of the nigro-striatal and nigro-amygdaloid pathways and the relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy bodies (LB) formation in the substantia nigra using 15 autopsied cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The substantia nigra possessed alpha-synuclein-positive LB-bearing neurons that were almost evenly distributed, while the putamen exhibited diffuse or granular alpha-synuclein-immunostaining. The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein, Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central constituent of LB. By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Notably, carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes were immunodominant in GCIs, but the entire panel of antibodies immunostained cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) in dementia with LBs brain with similar intensity. Discrete immunostaining was demonstrated in NFTs and neuropil threads with various antibodies against phosphorylated tau, and in LBs with antibody against alpha-synuclein. The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease. Alpha-synuclein cortical Lewy bodies correlate with dementia in Parkinson's disease recent advances in immunostaining of alpha-synuclein have suggested the possible importance of cortical Lewy bodies (CLBs) in the brains of demented patients with PD. CLBs positive for alpha-synuclein are highly sensitive (91%) and specific (90%) neuropathologic markers of dementia in PD CLBs detected by alpha-synuclein antibodies in patients with PD are a more sensitive and specific correlate of dementia alpha-Synuclein immunoreactivity in dementia with Lewy bodies alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein recently identified as a specific component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites. alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles. The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites. These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs. Nigral and cortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic nigral neurites in Parkinson's disease and cortical Lewy body disease contain alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity PD brain demonstrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in nigral Lewy bodies, pale bodies and abnormal neurites. DLB cases demonstrated these findings as well as alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cortical Lewy bodies and CA2-3 neurites. These results suggest that, even in sporadic cases, there is an early and direct role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD and the neuropathologically related disorder DLB.

56bb68f9ac7ad1001900000b	What is the cause of Phthiriasis Palpebrarum?	Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. We report a case of unilateral phthiriasis palpebrarum with crab louse.  BACKGROUND: Pediculosis capitis is a common parasitic infestation, whereas phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon infection due to Phthirus pubis (pubic lice) inoculating the eyelashes and surrounding tissues of the eye.  Head lice typically do not infect the eyes, and given the different morphology of the lice on the patient's head and eyes, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made.  P. pubis can cause pruritic eyelid margins or unusual blepharoconjunctivitis. We present a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 4-year-old boy. INTRODUCTION: Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an ectoparasitosis in which Phthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. In all cases, the diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was confirmed by parasitological examination of eyelashes, which revealed the presence of adult and nit forms of Phthirus pubis.  Based on the observation of numerous nits at the base of the eyelashes and the ectoparasite in the palpebral margin, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made. Phthiriasis palpebrarum (lice infestation of palpabrae) is a rarely reported disorder and may present as blepharoconjuctivitis.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis. Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Phthirus pubis, is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis; therefore, this condition is easily misdiagnosed Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an unusual cause of blepharoconjunctivitis and may easily be overlooked because of the failure of physicians to recognize Phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an infestation of the eyelashes caused by the louse Pthirus pubis (Linnaeus, 1758).  Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Phthirus pubis, is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis; therefore, this condition is easily misdiagnosed. Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected.

We report a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 6-year-old girl, which was initially misdiagnosed as allergic blepharoconjunctivitis. Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an unusual cause of blepharoconjunctivitis and may easily be overlooked because of the failure of physicians to recognize Phthirus pubis.	['Pthirus pubis']

56c1f03bef6e394741000053	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome?	 The disorder is caused by mutations to the NKX2.1 (TITF1) gene and also forms part of the "brain-lung-thyroid syndrome", in which additional developmental abnormalities of lung and thyroid tissue are observed.  Novel NKX2-1 Frameshift Mutations in Patients with Atypical Phenotypes of the Brain-Lung-Thyroid Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To verify the involvement of NKX2-1 gene in infants with brain-lung-thyroid (BLT) syndrome and hypothyroid phenotypes variable among congenital hypothyroidism (CH) or idiopathic mild hypothyroidism (IMH) of postnatal onset. They were carriers of new de novo heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 (c.177delG and c.153_166del14). CONCLUSIONS: Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 were identified in 2 cases selected on the basis of a BLT-like phenotype among 183 hypothyroid infants.  NKX2-1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: a case series of four patients. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (BLTS) characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, respiratory distress syndrome, and benign hereditary chorea is caused by thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TTF1) mutations. Two of the four patients presenting with the triad of BLTS had NKX2-1 mutations, and one of these NKX2-1 [c.890_896del (p.Ala327Glyfs*52)] is a novel variant. The third patient without any identified NKX2-1 mutations was a carrier of mitochondrial mutation; this raises the possibility of mitochondrial mutations contributing to thyroid dysgenesis. Although rare, the triad of congenital hypothyroidism, neurological, and respiratory signs is highly suggestive of NKX2-1 anomalies. Screening for NKX2-1 mutations in patients with thyroid, lung, and neurological abnormalities will enable a unifying diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected families. In addition, identification of an NKX2-1 defect would be helpful in allaying the concerns about inadequate thyroxine supplementation as the cause of neurological defects observed in some children with congenital hypothyroidism. Loss-of-function mutations in NKX2.1, a gene vital to the normal development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid, have been identified in a number of individuals. BACKGROUND: NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. CONCLUSION: MLPA should be considered as a complementary tool in patients with partial or total brain-lung-thyroid syndrome when direct sequencing failed to identify NKX2.1 mutations.  Mutations in NKX2-1 cause neurological, pulmonary, and thyroid hormone impairment. Recently, the disease was named brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  Genetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in two patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb deletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient. Congenital hypothyroidism was not detected on neonatal screening in the patient with the missense mutation, and frequent respiratory infections were observed in the patient with the deletion in NKX2-1.  Haploinsufficiency of NKX2.1, the gene encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)--critical for lung, thyroid and central nervous system morphogenesis and function--causes a rare form of progressive respiratory failure designated brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  We report a novel TTF-1 molecular defect causing recurrent respiratory failure episodes in an infant. In conclusion, ILD in patients with NKX2-1 mutations was associated with altered surfactant protein metabolism, and both gain and loss of function of the mutated NKX2-1 genes on surfactant protein promoters were associated with ILD in "Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome". Thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TITF1) mutations cause brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, characterized by congenital hypothyroidism (CH), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC). The objectives of the present study were (i) detection of NKX2-1 mutations in patients with CH associated with pneumopathy and/or BHC, (ii) functional analysis of new mutations in vitro and (iii) description of the phenotypic spectrum of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Five new TTF1/NKX2.1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: rescue by PAX8 synergism in one case. NKX2-1 mutations leading to surfactant protein promoter dysregulation cause interstitial lung disease in "Brain-Lung-Thyroid Syndrome". Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification improves the detection rate of NKX2.1 mutations in patients affected by brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. The clinical spectrum of 6 own and 40 published patients with NKX2-1 mutations ranged from the complete triad of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (50%), brain and thyroid disease (30%), to isolated BHC (13%).

5ac725250340b9f058000006	Which miRNA is associated with the circular RNA ciRS-7?	In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear. Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues.  This review summarizes the structure and function of circRNAs and provides evidence for the impact of ciRS-7 in promoting the development of cancer by acting as sponge of miR-7.	['miR-7']

58b6bd2622d300530900000c	Which ApoE isoform is associated with hyperlipoproteinemia?	ApoE2 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Arg158Cys located near the LDLR recognition site exhibits impaired binding to the receptor and an inability to promote clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles; this isoform is associated with Type-III hyperlipoproteinemia.  Type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP), a disorder associated with a high incidence of premature cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma. The primary genetic defect in patients with type III HLP is the presence of apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2), an isoform of apoE, and accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma has been thought to be attributable to the presence of apoE2, which bind poorly to low density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in defective remnant lipoprotein clearance.  ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele.  Reduced expression of the LDLR is believed to be a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in some humans homozygous for the apoE2 allele (APOE*2).  Overall, the 2.3-fold normal level of LDLR message in heterozygotes completely ameliorates type III HLP caused by the homozygosity for the human APOE*2 allele, normalizing their plasma lipoprotein profile. Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia and spontaneous atherosclerosis in mice resulting from gene replacement of mouse Apoe with human Apoe*2. Mice expressing human apoE2 (2/2) have virtually all the characteristics of type III hyperlipoproteinemia.  ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Type III hyperlipoproteinemia typically is associated with homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158----Cys). ApoE is a polymorphic protein, and homozygosity for the E2 allele is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Homozygosity for the apolipoprotein (apo) E variant apoE2(158 Arg----Cys) invariably gives rise to dysbetalipoproteinemia, and when associated with obesity or a gene for hyperlipidemia, results in type III hyperlipoproteinemia. ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). From the data of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of hyperlipoproteinemia. Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist Whereas the association of the apo E2 isoform with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia type III is well established, the plasma- and LDL-cholesterol lowering effects of apo E2 and the phenomenon of apo E4 raising these parameters on the development of coronary heart disease is still a matter of controversial discussion.  The primary genetic defect in patients with type III HLP is the presence of apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2), an isoform of apoE, and accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma has been thought to be attributable to the presence of apoE2, which bind poorly to low density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in defective remnant lipoprotein clearance.  In the normal population, ApoE3 isoform is the most prevalent, and ApoE2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. ApoE2 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Arg158Cys located near the LDLR recognition site exhibits impaired binding to the receptor and an inability to promote clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles; this isoform is associated with Type-III hyperlipoproteinemia. In the normal population apo E3 isoform is most prevalent and apo E2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. From the data of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of hyperlipoproteinemia. We describe a new variant of apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, which is, in contrast to apoE-2, dominantly associated with type III HLP. ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by delayed chylomicron and VLDL remnant catabolism and is associated with homozygosity for the apoE-2 allele. The association of the E2/2 phenotype with type IV/V hyperlipoproteinemia rather than type III hyperlipoproteinemia in identical twin brothers led us to investigate the primary structure of their apoE. ApoE2 is defective in binding and homozygosity for apoE2 is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Homozygous carriers of apoE2 have an increased risk to develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia, whereas apoE4 is associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Patients homozygous for apolipoprotein E2 are predisposed to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and apoE2 may be protective against AD.	['ApoE2 isoform', 'Apolipoprotein E2 isoform']
5c61d278e842deac67000005	Which disease can be classified with the Awaji Criteria?	Adoption of the Awaji criteria significantly increased the yield of EMG-positive segments in the cervical (P < 0.0005) and lumbosacral (P < 0.0001) regions, and upgraded 19 patients into the probable category and 1 patient into the definite category. The Awaji criteria increases the diagnostic sensitivity of the revised El Escorial criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis in a Chinese population. However, previous studies that have assessed the diagnostic sensitivities of the Awaji criteria (AC) and the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in patients with ALS have been inconsistent, most of them were consensual regarding the advantage of Awaji over conventional criteria. Our study sought to compare the roles of AC and rEEC in the diagnosis of ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that the AC exhibited greater diagnostic sensitivity than the rEEC in a Chinese ALS population.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the added prognostic value of the aggregated clinical and electrodiagnostic data, which define a given diagnostic category according to the Awaji or revised El Escorial criteria at time of diagnosis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Diagnostic category according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0177) criteria, definite ALS according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0343) and number of regions with LMN involvement (p < 0.0001) were all associated with shorter survival. Methods: This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study including a consecutive series of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to Awaji's criteria.  The importance of fasciculation potentials in the diagnosis of ALS led to changes in electrophysiological criteria at Awaji consensus conference.  Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies. STUDY SELECTION We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS. CONCLUSION The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS. In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS.

CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Awaji and revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Awaji Commission recently proposed a modification of the electrodiagnostic criteria for ALS. INTRODUCTION Recently, some authors have claimed that the Awaji criteria (AC) are not always more sensitive than the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The updated Awaji criteria enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity in limb-onset ALS. BACKGROUND Recently, new electrophysiological ALS criteria incorporating fasciculation potentials (FPs) as evidence for lower motor neuron signs (Awaji Criteria (AC)) was proposed to provide earlier detection of early-stage ALS than revised El Escorial electrophysiological criteria (REEC). The Awaji criteria, recently introduced to increase diagnosis sensitivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), equate the diagnostic significance of neurogenic electrophysiological changes to clinical signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months. New diagnostic criteria for ALS, the Awaji algorithm, reintroduced fasciculations as evidence of acute denervation equivalent to that of fibrillations and positive sharp waves. Given that cortical hyperexcitability appears to be an early feature in ALS, the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation technique as an aid to the research-based Awaji criteria in establishing an earlier diagnosis of ALS. The specificity of the both criteria were identical, 99.5%, indicating the number needed to test in order to diagnose one extra case of ALS was 1.8 (1.5-2) for Awaji criteria and 2.4 (2-2.6) for rEEC.  We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS.  Our retrospective analysis of patients referred over a 6-month period to the electromyography (EMG) laboratory for suspected motor neuron disease (MND) showed a higher agreement of the Awaji modifications than the Airlie House criteria with the clinical diagnosis of ALS. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months.  Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.  <b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies.<br><b>DATA SOURCES</b>: MEDLINE and Web of Science (until October2011).<br><b>STUDY SELECTION</b>: We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS.<br><b>DATA EXTRACTION</b>: Evaluation and data extraction of identified studies were done independently. Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. Diagnostic accuracy of Awaji criteria was higher in bulbar- than in limb-onset cases.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS.<br> We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS. Using the El Escorial criteria, 51 patients were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS, 14 with probable laboratory-supported ALS, and 28 with possible ALS. Applying the Awaji recommendations, 66 patients were diagnosed with either definite or probable ALS, and 27 with possible ALS. Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.

56c1f045ef6e394741000058	Selexipag is used for which disease?	OBJECTIVE: Selexipag is a novel, oral, selective prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist in clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Selexipag for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This review was based on a PubMed search and focuses on the potential role of selexipag in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Selexipag showed effects on pharmacodynamic end points obtained with right heart catheterization in a Phase II trial in patients with PAH, and is being evaluated in the ongoing Phase III trial (GRIPHON trial, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01106014). Pending the GRIPHON trial results, selexipag could provide a convenient first-line prostacyclin treatment option for patients with PAH. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of selexipag, an orally available selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, in development for pulmonary arterial hypertension in healthy subjects. These data demonstrate that the relaxant efficacy of the selective IP receptor agonist selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 is not modified under conditions associated with PAH, whereas relaxation to treprostinil may be limited in the presence of mediators of disease.

SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and growth dysfunctions. The present report describes, for the first time, a Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia child with SMARCAL1 missense mutation (R561H) and manifestations of intussusception secondary to Epstein-Barr virus-negative non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who expired due to septicemia following chemotherapy. Mutations in SWI/SNF2 related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1 (SMARCAL1) gene are responsible for the disease. Sequence analysis revealed that patient was compound heterozygous for two SMARCAL1 mutations: a novel missense change (p.Arg247Pro) and a well-known nonsense mutation (p.

In this report, interactions between human Ctf4 (hCtf4) and the replicative helicase containing the cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45)/minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (Mcm2-7)/Go, Ichi, Nii, and San (GINS) (CMG) proteins [human CMG (hCMG) complex] were examined We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex Drosophila Ctf4 is essential for efficient DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression The Ctf4 protein has been shown to be a central member of the replication fork and links the replicative MCM helicase and DNA polymerase α primase  it has been implicated as a member of a complex that promotes replication fork stability, the Fork Protection Complex (FPC), and as being important for sister chromatid cohesion Drosophila Ctf4 is a conserved protein that interacts with members of the GINS complex, Mcm2, and Polymerase α primase Ctf4 remains a central player in DNA replication These data indicate that Ctf4p facilitates Mcm10p to promote the DNA replication  hCtf4 plays an essential role in DNA replication and its ability to stimulate the replicative DNA polymerases  Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha coupling MCM2-7 to replicative polymerases is an important feature of the regulation of chromosome replication in eukaryotes, and highlight a key role for Ctf4 in this process Ctf4 coordinates the progression of helicase and DNA polymerase alpha Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication We show that And-1/Ctf4 (Chromosome transmission fidelity 4) interacts with Mcm10, which associates with MCM2-7, and with the p180 subunit of DNA pol alpha And-1/Ctf4 is therefore a new replication initiation factor that brings together the MCM2-7 helicase and the DNA pol alpha-primase complex, analogous to the linker between helicase and primase or helicase and polymerase that is seen in the bacterial replication machinery Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication. Ctf4 remains a central player in DNA replication. Drosophila Ctf4 is essential for efficient DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression. Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1 on DNA replication. Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In this report, we examined the mechanism of action of human Ctf4 (hCtf4) in DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo. And-1/Ctf4 is therefore a new replication initiation factor that brings together the MCM2-7 helicase and the DNA pol alpha-primase complex, analogous to the linker between helicase and primase or helicase and polymerase that is seen in the bacterial replication machinery. We show that cells lacking both Ctf4 and Mrc1 experience chronic activation of the DNA damage checkpoint during chromosome replication and do not complete the cell cycle. Using in vivo RNAi knockdown of CTF4 in Drosophila we show that Ctf4 is required for viability, S phase progression, sister chromatid cohesion, endoreplication, and coping with replication stress. We show that Ctf4 function is conserved and that Drosophila can be effectively used as a model to further probe the precise function of Ctf4 as a member of the replication fork and possible roles in development. Chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (Ctf4) is a conserved protein required for DNA replication. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. A key role for Ctf4 in coupling the MCM2-7 helicase to DNA polymerase alpha within the eukaryotic replisome.
