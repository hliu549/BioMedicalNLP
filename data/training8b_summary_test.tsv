5312f0f0e3eabad02100000d	What is the mechanism of action of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors?	DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors are a major class of cancer chemotherapeutics, which are thought to eliminate cancer cells by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. We show that anthracyclines promote histone eviction irrespective of their ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks. The histone variant H2AX, which is a key component of the DNA damage response, is also evicted by anthracyclines, and H2AX eviction is associated with attenuated DNA repair. Induction of apoptotic cell death by DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors The results we have obtained clearly indicate that topoisomerase II poisons induce cell death by apoptosis. Histone eviction deregulates the transcriptome in cancer cells We define a novel mechanism of action of anthracycline anticancer drugs doxorubicin and daunorubicin on chromatin biology, with important consequences for DNA damage responses, epigenetics, transcription	['DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors eliminate cancer cells by causing DNA double-strand breaks, finally leading to apoptotic cell death.

5319a83bb166e2b80600002c	What is the use of emulsion PCR in Next Generation Sequencing?	Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing. The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors. Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. In our NGS approach, the 16,569-bp mtDNA is enriched by long-range PCR and the 108 nuclear genes (which represent 1301 amplicons and 680 kb) are enriched by RainDance emulsion PCR. Sequencing is performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or MiSeq platforms, and bioinformatics analysis is performed using commercial and in-house developed bioinformatics pipelines. However, pyrosequencing of emulsion PCR reactions, amplifying from only one molecule at a time, can generate megabases of clonally amplified loci at high coverage, thereby greatly simplifying allelic sequence determination. During genomic PCR, in this 4-primer system, the outer set of primers containing the MID and the 454 adaptor sequences are incorporated into an amplicon generated by the inner HLA target-specific primers each containing a common sequence tag at the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Pools of the resulting amplicons are used for emulsion PCR and clonal sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX System, followed by genotyping with Conexio software. The purpose of our study was to compare NGS enrichment methods for a clinical assay targeting the nine genes known to be associated with aortopathy. RainDance emulsion PCR and SureSelect RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment methods were directly compared by enriching DNA from eight samples. We show the efficacy by comparing the method to a commercial kit and further demonstrate that emulsion PCR can be used for bias free amplification and virtual immortalization of DNA template libraries. Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR. Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads. The protocol is simple and provides an even sequence distribution of multiplex libraries when sequencing the flow-sorted beads. Moreover, since many empty and mixed emulsion PCR beads are removed, the approach gives rise to a substantial increase in sequence quality and mean read length, as compared to that obtained by standard enrichment protocols. Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX. Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads. The library samples were loaded to sequencing Chip for Work Flow Analysis (WFA) or sequencing running with default parameters.

5c5866c086df2b9174000002	Describe clinical presentation of Escobar syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Escobar syndrome, a nonlethal variant of multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pterygia and multiple joint contractures along with other anomalies. It is generally characterized by multiple pterygia that are found in the cervical, antecubital and popliteal regions. In this report, we present the treatment management of a 14-year-old case with late stage Escobar syndrome who was admitted due to multiple pterygia and bilateral knee contractures. Escobar syndrome is a nonlethal subtype of multiple pterygium syndromes, characterized by webbing across the joints, congenital joint contracture, facial dysmorphism and a variety of other congenital anomalies. The Escobar variant of multiple pterygium syndrome (MPS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder which may lead to many serious or even lethal fetal abnormalities. MPS is characterized by pterygia, arthrogryposis (joint contractures), and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the case described below, increased fetal nuchal translucency was the first abnormality diagnosed already in the first trimester of pregnancy. Other symptoms of the disease were found during the second trimester of pregnancy using ultrasonography examination. Nonlethal multiple pterygium syndrome: Escobar syndrome. Escobar syndrome (ES) or multiple pterygia syndrome (MIM#265000) is an infrequent condition characterized by facial dysmorphism, multiple webbing (pterygia), congenital contractures (arthrogryposis) and other internal anomalies.  Escobar syndrome is characterized with multiple pterygia or webs of the skin and multiple congenital anomalies. Nonlethal Escobar is a rare disorder that is a variant of multiple pterygium syndromes. It is a form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita characterized by excessive webbing (pterygia), congenital contractures (arthrogryposis), and scoliosis.

54f1e887c409818c32000004	What is known about thalidomide therapy and survival of glioblastoma patients?	In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The authors previously reported improved outcome in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with thalidomide and irinotecan compared with historical controls.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and irinotecan did not achieve sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation against AG, although a subset of patients experienced prolonged PFS/OS.  The treatment regimen was well tolerated. OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT. The addition of celecoxib and thalidomide to adjuvant temozolomide was well tolerated but did not meet the primary end point of improvement of 4-month PFS from study enrollment. CONCLUSION: The combination of irinotecan and thalidomide has limited activity against GBM. The combination of irinotecan, a cytotoxic agent, and thalidomide, an antiangiogenic agent, shows promising activity against recurrent GBM in patients not receiving EIACs and warrants further study.  CONCLUSION: The administration of temozolomide in association with thalidomide after radiotherapy (RT) does not offer an advantage over temozolomide alone in adults with newly diagnosed GBM. The two therapeutic strategies produce similar results for survival, but the latter regimen shows a moderate increase in toxicity. CONCLUSION: This drug combination was reasonably safe, but with little indication of improvement compared to temozolomide alone. In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased. Experimental studies have demonstrated that thalidomide has anti-tumor activity mediated by blockage of angiogenesis, with clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme, and renal cell cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy was relatively well tolerated, but there was no survival advantage compared with historical studies using XRT either with adjuvant nitrosourea chemotherapy, with TMZ alone, or with the combination of TMZ and thalidomide. PURPOSE: The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide have both demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy of combination TMZ, thalid and RT was relatively well tolerated with favorable survival outcome for patients with GM when compared to patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and similar to those who have received nitrosourea adjuvant chemotherapy. It is unclear the added advantage thalid has in combination with TMZ for this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and temozolomide in the treatment of GBM appears to be more effective than that of thalidomide alone with respect to survival, TTP, and neuroradiological documentation of progression, stable disease or response.  In conclusion, thalidomide induces modest side effects and it may be considered a valid therapeutic option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Thalidomide is a well-tolerated drug that may have some activity in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.  Eight patients were alive more than 1 year after starting thalidomide, although almost all with tumor progression.   In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thalidomide prolongs disease stabilization after conventional therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression	['Findings regarding clinical value of thalidomide in terms of survival in patients with glioblastoma remain mixed.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention.  Conclusions As a preventive treatment of episodic migraine, erenumab at a dosage of 70 mg monthly significantly reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication use.  CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.  Estimating the clinical effectiveness and value-based price range of erenumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with prior treatment failures: a US societal perspective. CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).  Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant ER(+) human breast cancer cell lines and mice bearing PIK3CA-mutant xenografts were treated with the antiestrogen fulvestrant, the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (pictilisib; varied doses/schedules that provided similar amounts of drug each week), or combinations.  These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene. Phase II Randomized Preoperative Window-of-Opportunity Study of the PI3K Inhibitor Pictilisib Plus Anastrozole Compared With Anastrozole Alone in Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer. This preoperative window study assessed whether adding the PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941) can increase the antitumor effects of anastrozole in primary breast cancer and aimed to identify the most appropriate patient population for combination therapy. In contrast to parental cells, resistant cells were sensitive to growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by the class I PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941 (pictilisib), which also induced FOXO1 nuclear translocation. Using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform, we discovered that plasma concentrations of 26 metabolites, including amino acids, acylcarnitines, and phosphatidylcholines, were decreased in mice bearing PTEN-deficient tumors compared with non-tumor-bearing controls and in addition were increased following dosing with class I PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941).

We show that the MS signal of histones can be used as a "proteomic ruler" because it is proportional to the amount of DNA in the sample, which in turn depends on the number of cells. As a result, our proteomic ruler approach adds an absolute scale to the MS readout and allows estimation of the copy numbers of individual proteins per cell.

Nucleosome arrays inhibit both initiation and elongation of transcripts  Both transcript initiation and elongation were inhibited, the extent of the inhibition being directly proportional to the number of nucleosome cores reconstituted onto the pT207-18 DNA templates. neither partial nor complete dissociation of the histone octamer is essential for transcription elongation through arrays of nucleosome cores in vitro. The high affinity of histones for single-stranded DNA observed in titration experiments performed using the purified (+) and (-) strands of the NX1 fragment suggests that nucleosome dissociation is not due to the formation of segments of single-stranded DNA by RNA polymerase in the elongation process These effects are especially pronounced on chromatin templates, where both transcription initiation and elongation are virtually halted. The inhibition of transcription elongation appears to result from a dramatic increase in premature termination of transcripts. By using this system, we show that BRG1, the enzymatic motor of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, is recruited to the positioned nucleosome in a transcription elongation-dependent manner and facilitates traversal of the nucleosome by RNAPII. in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin  We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.

56e0813651531f7e33000010	What are viral vectors used for in optogenetics?	To express ChR in neurons, the common expression systems include viral vectors, in utero electroporation, and transgenic animals, each with their advantages and limitations regarding the cost, expression pattern, and the required effort.  In this review, the various strategies for selective genetic targeting of a defined neuronal population are discussed as well as the pros and cons of the use of transgenic animals and recombinant viral vectors for the expression of transgenes in a specific set of neurons. We demonstrate how the ability to target astrocytes with cell-specific viral vectors to express optogenetic constructs helped to unravel some previously unsuspected roles of these inconspicuous cells. Optogenetics, the use of light to stimulate or inhibit neural circuits via viral transduction of protein channels, has emerged as a possible method of treating epilepsy. We demonstrate how the ability to target astrocytes with cell-specific viral vectors to express optogenetic constructs helped to unravel some previously unsuspected roles of these inconspicuous cells. We conclude that a viral vector approach with a strong promoter is required for successful optogenetic stimulation of distal axons to evoke transmitter release in pre-autonomic PVN neurons. RESULTS: Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from infralimbic (IL) pyramidal cells, IL interneurons and prelimbic (PL) pyramidal cells 2-3 weeks after intra-IL injection of a viral vector encoding channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) under the control of the CaMKII promoter (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP) or a control vector that lacked the ChR2 sequence (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-EYFP).  We conclude that a viral vector approach with a strong promoter is required for successful optogenetic stimulation of distal axons to evoke transmitter release in pre-autonomic PVN neurons.  We selectively expressed ChR2(H134R) in rostral VLM catecholaminergic neurons by injecting Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vectors into the brain of adult dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH)(Cre/0) mice.  We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before.  We generated rabies glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that use a positive feedback loop composed of a Tet promoter driving both its own tetracycline-dependent transcription activator (tTA) ("TLoop") and channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2YFP).  Optogenetic control of cardiomyocytes via viral delivery. Here, we used an optogenetic approach, in which female rats received bilateral dorsal mPFC microinjections of viral constructs coding light-sensitive eNpHR3.0-eYFP or control eYFP protein and intracranial fiber optic implants.  We transduced rat LC neurons by direct injection of a lentiviral vector expressing channelrhodopsin2 under the control of the PRS promoter.  Here, we describe the construction of a blue-light-induced K(+) channel 1 (BLINK1) engineered by fusing the plant LOV2-J� photosensory module to the small viral K(+) channel Kcv.  In parallel, remarkable success in the development of highly efficient viral vectors for ocular gene therapy led to new strategies of using these novel optogenetic tools for vision restoration.  These recent findings show that novel optogenetic tools and viral vectors for ocular gene delivery are now available providing many opportunities to develop potential optogenetic strategies for vision restoration.

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility.

531b2fc3b166e2b80600003c	What is the prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure?	 Cumulative survival was significantly lower among patients with free triiodothyronine < 2.12 pg/mL and among patients with brain natriuretic peptide > 686 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors of major cardiac events were age, free triiodothyronine, and brain natriuretic peptide The T3 was more meaningful than the BNP in the prognosis of CHF. The BNP and T3 combination detection was more valuable in determining the severity of CHF and prognosis. fT3 and BNP hold an independent and additive prognostic value in HF. Univariate regression analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4 (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained significantly associated with the events. Low T(3) levels are an independent predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, adding prognostic information to conventional clinical and functional cardiac parameters. Sixteen patients (14%) died during the follow-up period; their fT3/fT4 ratio was significantly lower than the patients who survived (1.31+/-0.37 vs. 2.01+/-0.72, p<0.001). The authors conclude that among elderly patients with heart failure, lower triiodothyronine concentrations are more prevalent and are associated with a worse prognosis. A low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio is associated with poor ventricular function and nutritional status and is the strongest predictor yet identified for short-term outcome in patients with advanced heart failure.

Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs. Four high-throughput studies have provided a compendium of motifs that function as exonic splice enhancers, but only one, RESCUE-ESE, has been generally employed to examine the properties of enhancers. Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs. Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs.	["In mammals there is a bias in amino acid usage near splice sites that is explained, in large part, by the high density of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in these regions. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) activate pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of the flanking splice sites. Some of these variants may have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing, either by altering degenerate positions of splice site sequences or by affecting intronic or exonic splicing regulatory sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements. FELINES was shown to be useful for characterizing branchsites, polypyrimidine tracts and 5' and 3' splice sites in the intron databases and exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in S.pombe exons. Unexpectedly, a fully experimental dataset identifies motifs that commonly behave opposite to the consensus, for example, being enriched in exon cores where splice-associated mutations are rare.Prior analyses that used the RESCUE-ESE set of hexamers captured the properties of consensus exonic splice enhancers.", 'Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs.

IRG1 is highly upregulated in murine ANA-1 macrophages by several proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, as well as in spleen and lung of Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, respectively The proinflammatory cytokine-induced IRG1 protein associates with mitochondria multiple genes induced by Borrelia burgdorferi in macrophages to regulate Lyme disease inflammation One of these genes, IRG1, was confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to be involved in susceptibility. Its precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, although the analysis of gene expression data suggests it has a role in apoptosis. Murine immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) plays significant roles in embryonic implantation and neurodegeneration the IRG1 gene is differentially expressed in human fetal PBMCs and LPS-stimulated adult PBMCs. we identified the immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1), which was expressed substantially higher in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated than in MAP-infected murine macrophage cell lines. The inhibitor also blocked induction by LIF of several LIF-regulated genes in the LE including Irg1, which has been shown previously to be essential for implantation. Immune-responsive gene 1 is a novel target of progesterone receptor and plays a critical role during implantation in the mouse. our studies identified Irg1 as a novel target of PR in the pregnant uterus and also revealed that it is a critical regulator of the early events leading to implantation  This resulted in the identification of one novel P4-regulated gene that had been previously found in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and called immune response gene-1 (Irg1) and which is the mammalian ortholog of the bacterial gene encoding methylcitrate dehydratase the mammalian ortholog of methylcitrate dehydratase (immune response gene 1) Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1). T Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1). This gene exhibits significant homology to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta-inducible human genes p27 and 6-16, indicating that these genes may belong to the same family The level of IRG1 mRNA again rose transiently on day 4 immediately preceding implantation. Although the functional roles of IRG1 and p27 remain unclear, we describe for the first time, identification of a gene family regulated by IFNalpha in both rodent and human uteri Hence, the induction of IRG1 by LPS is mediated by tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C pathway.	['Human IRG1 and mouse Irg1 mediates antiviral and antimicrobial immune responses, without its exact role having been elucidated. Irg1 has been suggested to have a role in apoptosis and to play a significant role in embryonic implantation. Irg1 is reported as the mammalian ortholog of methylcitrate dehydratase.']

Fyn is an attractive target for AD therapeutics, not only based on its activation by Aβ via cellular prion protein but also due to its known interaction with tau, uniquely linking the two key pathologies in AD. This PrPC-Aβo complex activates Fyn kinase which, in turn, hyperphosphorylates tau (P-Tau) resulting in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits.

5cf619a8a49efeb44c000010	What is the function of the Spt6 gene in yeast?	Spt6 is a highly conserved histone chaperone that interacts directly with both RNA polymerase II and histones to regulate gene expression. Spt6 is a highly conserved factor required for normal transcription and chromatin structure.  Binding of elongation factor Spt6 to Iws1 provides an effective means for coupling eukaryotic mRNA synthesis, chromatin remodelling and mRNA export.  Spt6 Is Essential for rRNA Synthesis by RNA Polymerase I. Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. These effects are mediated through interactions with histones, transcription factors, and the RNA polymerase. Two lines of evidence suggest that Spt6 also plays a role in rRNA synthesis. We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression.  Previous characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins suggested that these proteins act as transcription factors that modify chromatin structure. The SPT4, SPT5, and SPT6 gene products define a class of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought to function through their effects on chromatin assembly or stability. The SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified originally by mutations that suppress delta insertion mutations at HIS4 and LYS2.  Taken together, these genetic and biochemical results indicate that SPT4, SPT5 and SPT6 function together in a transcriptional process that is essential for viability in yeast.

58cd633c02b8c6095300003a	What is known about telomere length shortening and stress?	A significant relationship between more perceived stress and shorter telomere length is consistent with theoretical frameworks positing that stress induces physiological changes that result in shortened telomeres.  Psychological stress contributes to numerous diseases and may do so in part through damage to telomeres, protective non-coding segments on the ends of chromosomes. Our results support the hypothesis that depression is associated with accelerated cell aging. Future studies are required to clarify whether the association is mediated through environmental stress, and whether effective treatment can halt cell aging. Telomere length, a reliable predictor of disease pathogenesis, can be affected by genetics, chronic stress and health behaviors. Cross-sectionally, highly stressed postmenopausal women have shorter telomeres, but only if they are inactive.

5a6f8dc6b750ff4455000058	Is trastuzumab associated cardiotoxicity reversible?	Although reduction of cardiac function by trastuzumab is mostly reversible, some patients, especially those with cardiac risk factors, may rarely experience chronic heart failure or prolonged left ventricular ejection fraction reduction.  We report the rare case of a metastatic breast cancer in a woman without cardiac risk factors who experienced long-term irreversible cardiotoxicity after discontinuation of trastuzumab therapy. Long-term irreversible trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity for metastatic breast cancer in a patient without cardiac risk factors. Similar to prior observations in breast cancer, TIC in gastric cancer patients is not frequent or reversible.  BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect, manifesting as either an asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF).  Furthermore, recent retrospective studies have shown an increased incidence of heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy in patients treated with trastuzumab, that can persist many years after the conclusion of the therapy, thus suggesting that the side toxic effects are not always reversible as it was initially proposed.  Trastuzumab-induced CT may be reversible.  BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a HER2 monoclonal antibody, has transformed the prognosis of patients with the aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer type. Trastuzumab augments the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines, but its effect is thought to be at least partially reversible. CONCLUSIONS: LV dilation and subclinical impairment in cardiac function persists>2 years after the end of anthracycline and trastuzumab treatment, without significant recovery after trastuzumab cessation, suggestive of long-term underlying cardiac damage and remodeling. Because trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity is reversible, efforts to improve the adequacy of cardiac monitoring are needed, particularly in vulnerable populations. CONCLUSION: PHARE confirm that the incidence of cardiac end-points remains low and mostly reversible after trastuzumab.  Several breast cancer therapies can lead to cardiovascular toxicity: drugs such anthracyclines can cause permanent damage, anti-HER2 agents may cause transitory and reversible cardiac dysfunction and others, such as those used in endocrine therapy, primarily disturb lipid metabolism.  BACKGROUND: Although it is known that trastuzumab causes cardiotoxicity, its extent and reversibility are still in question. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity may induce reversible damage that is usually transitory and improves with trastuzumab withdrawal. The cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab also differs from traditional chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in that it appears to be at least partially reversible, not related to the cumulative dose, and re-challenge is generally tolerated. It is of note that the cardiotoxicity is generally reversible and can usually be managed with standard medical treatment. Although reversible in most cases, cardiotoxicity frequently results in the discontinuation of trastuzumab. The cardiac dysfunction associated with trastuzumab is most often reversible upon discontinuation of treatment and initiation of standard medical therapy for CHF. Two categories of cardiotoxic side effects of antineoplastic drugs have been previously proposed: Type I cardiotoxicity, defined as permanent cardiotoxicity, is usually caused by anthracyclines; Type II cardiotoxicity, considered as reversible cardiotoxicity, has been mainly related to monoclonal antibodies. The long-term significance of these events, isolating known cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines from those of trastuzumab, and the appropriateness of referring to trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity as reversible rather than responsive to trastuzumab withdrawal and heart failure medical therapy, are issues that continue to be debated. LVEF improved in most patients regardless of whether or not trastuzumab was continued.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. Reversible cardiotoxicity in a 54-year-old woman treated with trastuzumab. Reversibility of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity: new insights based on clinical course and response to medical treatment. Type II cardiac changes occur in trastuzumab-treated patients, which do not appear to be dose-related, are not associated with histological changes, and are generally reversible.

54dcb29dc0bb8dce23000004	Which pathological condition of the heart is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)?	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disease of the cardiac muscle that occurs mainly due to mutations (>1,400 variants) in genes encoding for the cardiac sarcomere. HCM, the most common familial form of cardiomyopathy, affecting one in every 500 people in the general population, is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and presents variable expressivity and age-related penetrance. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), due to point mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins such as myosin, occurs in 1/500 people and is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals. n HCM, the modified protein function leads, over years to decades, to secondary remodeling with substantial morphological changes, such as hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and extensive fibrosis associated with severe functional deterioration. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young, particularly among athletes. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one the most common heart disorders, with gene mutations in the cardiac sarcomere. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been recently recognized as the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 adults worldwide. HCM is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy resulting in thickening of the ventricular wall, myocyte disarray, interstitial and/or replacement fibrosis, decreased ventricular cavity volume and diastolic dysfunction. HCM is also the most common cause of sudden death in the young. A large proportion of patients diagnosed with HCM have mutations in sarcomeric proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of phenotypic expression, in the absence of another systemic or cardiac disease causing increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, is estimated to be 1:500.  HCM is the most prevalent genetic disorder affecting the heart, it often goes undiagnosed until midlife after patients show symptoms of myocardial remodeling. Adults with cardiomyopathy suffer SCD or adverse events such as stroke and heart failure from HCM. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous autosomal dominant heart disease characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease that is capable of producing significant wall thickening. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited genetic disease characterized by compensatory pathological left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy due to sarcomere dysfunction.

56f82a39cf1c325851000001	What is protein carbamylation?	urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues.  Carbamylation describes a nonenzymatic posttranslational protein modification mediated by cyanate, a dissociation product of urea.  Cyanate, a reactive electrophilic species in equilibrium with urea, posttranslationally modifies proteins through a process called carbamylation, which promotes atherosclerosis.  Protein carbamylation, a posttranslational modification promoted during uremia and catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) at sites of inflammation, is linked to altered protein structure, vascular dysfunction, and poor prognosis.  Carbamylation (carbamoylation) of lysine residues and protein N-termini is a nonenzymatic PTM that has been related to protein ageing. In contrast to other PTM, such as phosphorylation, carbamylation can be artificially introduced during sample preparation with urea, thus affecting studies directed toward in vivo carbamylation.  Carbamylation is a general process involved in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups.  Protein carbamylation is one of the important post-translational modifications, which plays a pivotal role in a number of biological conditions, such as diseases, chronic renal failure and atherosclerosis. Protein carbamylation is a post-translational modification that can occur in the presence of urea. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines, arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines.  Carbamylation of proteins through reactive cyanate has been demonstrated to predict an increased cardiovascular risk.  Protein carbamylation is of great concern both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we report the first structural characterization of a protein carbamylated at the N-terminal proline.  Post-translational modification and functional impairment of proteins through carbamylation is thought to promote vascular dysfunction during end-stage renal disease. Cyanate, a reactive species in equilibrium with urea, carbamylates protein lysine residues to form epsilon-carbamyllysine (homocitrulline), altering protein structure and function.

52fb19ab2059c6d71c00005c	What are the pregnancy outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis?	Patients with rheumatic disease can have successful pregnancy outcomes, particularly when a collaborative approach between the rheumatologist and obstetrician is applied.  Of 78 JIA pregnancies, 53 (68%) were delivered by either Caesarean section (n = 40, 51%) or instrumental delivery (n = 13, 17%); compared with other women, those with JIA had significantly higher rates of pre-eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage and severe maternal morbidity. Compared with other infants, those with mothers with JIA were more likely to be born prematurely, but were not at increased risk of being small for gestational age, requiring neonatal intensive care, having a low Apgar score at 5 min or severe neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Infants of women with JIA did not have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Intensive obstetric care might be required during pregnancy for women with JIA given the increased risk of maternal morbidity. High rate of preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by rheumatoid arthritis. Women with RA may be at higher risk for preterm delivery. A significant increase in frequency and number of cesarean deliveries, besides a higher number of pregnancies with preeclampsia, were found after RA onset. Additionally, four newborns with congenital anomalies were reported after the disease onset compared to none before RA onset. CONCLUSIONS: compared to pre-RA obstetric events, a higher frequency and number of adverse outcomes was found in pregnancies that occurred after RA onset. There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity in Canadian women with RA or SLE. Most pregnancies in women with rheumatologic disease will result in the delivery of a healthy baby. Pregnancy can be particularly risky in women with active disease or on teratogenic medications, Rheumatoid arthritis typically improves and does not have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes. Although the sample size is small, these data do not support the notion that there is a substantial increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to leflunomide exposure among women who undergo cholestyramine elimination procedure early in pregnancy. Nonetheless, pregnancies in most autoimmune diseases are still classified as high risk because of the potential for major complications. These complications include disease exacerbations during gestation and increased perinatal mortality and morbidity in most autoimmune diseases, We conclude that pregnancy outcome in patients with SLE in India is worse in comparison to patients with RA.  Women with RA had an increased risk of LBW, SGA babies, preeclampsia and CS compared with unaffected women. Infants of women with rheumatoid arthritis had increased risk of cesarean delivery (adjusted approximate relative risk, aRR=1.66, 95% CI (1.22, 2.26)), prematurity (aRR=1.78, 95% CI (1.21, 2.60)), and longer birth hospitalization (aRR=1.86, 95% CI (1.32, 2.60)) compared to those born to women without rheumatoid arthritis. Women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM had significantly increased rates of hypertensive disorders compared with the general obstetric population (23.2%, 11.1%, 27.4%, and 7.8%, respectively), longer hospital stays, and significantly higher risk of cesarean delivery. Although women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM were significantly older than women in the general obstetric population, disparities in the risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy remained statistically significant after adjustment for maternal age. women with SLE and RA appear to have a higher age-adjusted risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy and longer hospital stays than do pregnant women in the general population, and careful antenatal monitoring should be performed. In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX. However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains. In general, active inflammation from rheumatic diseases poses a stronger threat to the well-being of both mother and foetus than many immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, continued immunosuppression with the least risky medications will allow for the most optimal pregnancy outcomes.	['There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity.

514cd15ad24251bc05000067	What is the role of anhedonia in coronary disease patients?	Reduced positive affect and depression/anxiety were associated with poor prognosis, but reduced positive affect was the only independent predictor of events. The incidence of death/MI in adequate versus reduced positive affect patients was 4% (29/663) vs. 11% (23/211); HR = 2.55 (95% CI 1.46-4.34, P = 0.001), adjusting for clinical variables. Reduced positive affect and diabetes were independent prognostic factors, and patients with one (HR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.58-5.10) or both (HR = 5.61, 95% CI 2.25-13.99) of these factors had a higher risk when compared with nondiabetic patients with adequate positive affect, P < or = 0.003. Reduced positive affect independently predicted death/MI following stent implantation, and improved risk stratification above and beyond diabetes. Reduced positive affect (anhedonia) predicts major clinical events following implantation of coronary-artery stents. t follow-up, there were 176 clinical events (36 deaths, 8 MIs, 58 ACS, 55 hospital readmissions, 19 heart failures). Dimensional anhedonia and depression were associated with poor prognosis, but anhedonia was the only predictor of severe cardiac events and clinical events after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Contrary to depression, categorical anhedonia (PAS >23) was an independent and significant predictor of severe cardiac events after adjusting for clinical variables. The incidence of death/MI in hedonics vs anhedonics was 11.1% vs 22.1% (hazard ratio = 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.26). Dimensional and categorical anhedonias predicted independently severe cardiac events and clinical events after ACS. Only depressive symptoms of fatigue-sadness predicted prognosis in univariate (hazard ratio [HR]=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, P=.025) and multivariate analysis (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, P=.025). Symptoms of anhedonia (HR=1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.8, P=.102) and depressive cognitions (HR=1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.2, P=.402) did not. Controlling for sex, age, and medical covariates, anhedonia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.14; P < .01) was a significant predictor of combined MACE and ACM, but depressed mood was not. Anhedonia continued to significantly predict outcomes (P < .05) when additionally controlling for MDE diagnosis or depressive symptom severity. Anhedonia identifies risk of MACE and ACM beyond that of established medical prognostic indicators, including MDE and depressive symptom severity. The incidence of mortality in anhedonic patients was 22.7% (65/286) vs. 13.2% (121/920) in non-anhedonic patients (HR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.19-2.32], p = 0.003). Cumulative hazard functions were significantly different for anhedonic vs. non-anhedonic patients (log-rank χ(2) = 16.61, p < 0.001). n multivariable analysis, anhedonia remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.03-2.22], p = 0.036), after adjusting for socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and negative and relaxed affect. Anhedonia was independently associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality in patients who survived the first 6 months post-PCI. Depressive symptoms related to lack of enjoyment or pleasure and physical or cognitive slowing, as measured by the HADS-D, predicted all-cause mortality at 8 years ACS patients, whereas other depressive and anxiety symptoms did not.	['Anhedonia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with coronary disease. Namely, in patients with coronary disease, anhedonia was associated with increased mortality, greater risk for major cardiac event, impaired physical health status, more cardiac symptoms, more feelings of disability.

Among 1155 differentially expressed circRNAs, 715 were upregulated and 440 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that hsa_circ_103110, hsa_circ_104689 and hsa_circ_104821 levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, whereas hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were downregulated.  The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing breast cancer was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.90) when hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were used in combination. This study provides evidence that circRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are important in carcinogenesis because they participate in cancer-related pathways and sequester miRNAs. Circular RNAs and their associations with breast cancer subtypes. Notably, circRNA results reveal that normal-adjacent tissues in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) subtype have relatively higher numbers of circRNAs than tumor samples in TCGA. Similar phenomenon of high circRNA numbers were observed in normal breast-mammary tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Finally, we observed that number of circRNAs in normal-adjacent samples of ER+ subtype is inversely correlated to the risk-of-relapse proliferation (ROR-P) score for proliferating genes, suggesting that circRNA frequency may be a marker for cell proliferation in breast cancer. We believe that Circ-Seq will be a valuable tool to identify circRNAs useful in the diagnosis and treatment of other cancers and complex diseases.

571f356f0fd6f91b68000006	What are the skeletal muscle satellite cells?	Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are Pax7(+) myogenic stem cells that reside between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofiber. In mature muscles, SCs are typically quiescent, but can be activated in response to muscle injury. Depending on the magnitude of tissue trauma, SCs may divide minimally to repair subtle damage within individual myofibers or produce a larger progeny pool that forms new myofibers in cases of overt muscle injury Satellite cells (SC) are quiescent adult muscle stem cells critical for postnatal development Satellite cells are multipotential stem cells that mediate postnatal muscle growth and respond differently to temperature based upon aerobic versus anaerobic fiber-type origin Skeletal muscle mass, function, and repair capacity all progressively decline with aging, restricting mobility, voluntary function, and quality of life. Skeletal muscle repair is facilitated by a population of dedicated muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, that reside in anatomically defined niches within muscle tissues. In adult tissues, MuSCs are retained in a quiescent state until they are primed to regenerate damaged muscle through cycles of self-renewal divisions Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. Skeletal muscle satellite cells are quiescent mononucleated myogenic cells, located between the sarcolemma and basement membrane of terminally-differentiated muscle fibres. The acquisition of a proliferating-cell status from a quiescent state as well as the shift between proliferation and differentiation are key developmental steps in skeletal-muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to provide proper muscle regeneration Satellite cells are essential for skeletal muscle regeneration as they ultimately provide the myogenic precursors that rebuild damaged muscle tissue Skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to myogenesis and do not spontaneously adopt nonmyogenic fates. These are normally quiescent in adult muscle, but act as a reserve population of cells, able to proliferate in response to injury and give rise to regenerated muscle and to more satellite cells. Satellite cell-derived muscle precursor cells may be used to repair and regenerate damaged or myopathic skeletal muscle, or to act as vectors for gene therapy. Research focusing on the canonical adult myogenic progenitor, the skeletal muscle satellite cell, is still an ever-growing field 46 years from their initial description.  Skeletal muscle satellite cells, located between the basal lamina and plasma membrane of myofibers, are required for skeletal muscle regeneration. The capacity of satellite cells as well as other cell lineages including mesoangioblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and side population (SP) cells to contribute to muscle regeneration has complicated the identification of a satellite stem cell.  Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. In adult muscle, satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent.  Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue composed of non-dividing, multi-nucleated muscle fibres that contract to generate force in a controlled and directed manner. Skeletal muscle is formed during embryogenesis from a subset of muscle precursor cells, which generate both differentiated muscle fibres and specialized muscle-forming stem cells known as satellite cells.  Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. Sheep satellite cells have a greater similarity to human satellite cells with regard to metabolism, life span, proliferation and differentiation, than satellite cells of the rat and mouse.

56d046813975bb303a00000f	What is the effect of dovitinib on the cell cycle?	Dovitinib triggered a G2 /M arrest in cancer cell lines from diverse origins including HeLa, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Single-cell analysis revealed that Dovitinib promoted a delay in mitotic exit in a subset of cells, causing the cells to undergo mitotic slippage. Higher concentrations of Dovitinib induced a G2 arrest similar to the G2 DNA damage checkpoint.  Finally, Dovitinib-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death could be promoted after DNA damage repair was disrupted by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases.  Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with dovitinib resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and blockade of bFGF-induced cell migration. Finally, Dovitinib-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death could be promoted after DNA damage repair was disrupted by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases.

56f403d009dd18d46b000004	Which is the most well-accepted method for Down syndrome non-invasive prenatal diagnosis?	Potential of syncytiotrophoblasts isolated from the cervical mucus for early non-invasive prenatal diagnosis Maternal serum protein profile and immune response protein subunits as markers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21, 18, and 13 Maternal serum protein profiling using proteomics may allow non-invasive diagnostic testing for the most common trisomies and may complement ultrasound-based methods to more accurately determine pregnancies with fetal aneuploidies The presence of foetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA Using massively parallel sequencing, foetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 have been detected from maternal plasma. These developments suggest that the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma would play an increasingly important role in future obstetrics practice. Currently, two applications for NIPD of Down syndrome have been developed with potential and have displayed positive results; the NIPD using next-generation sequencing technologies and the NIPD using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from the plasma of peripheral blood from 121 women 9-20 weeks of pregnancy. Five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in PLAC4 gene were analyzed by reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA), followed by capillary electrophoresis Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 by dosage ratio of fetal chromosome-specific epigenetic markers in maternal plasma This study examined the methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A between maternal and placental DNA, and the implication of this difference in the identification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and in prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Diagnosis of trisomy 21 was established according to the ratio of fetal-specific AIRE to RASSF1A in maternal plasma. Both methods confirmed that AIRE and RASSF1A were hypomethylated in maternal blood cells but hypermethylated in placental or chorionic villus tissues. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Preliminary reports indicate that the detection of fetal aneuploidies might be possible using epigenetically modified genes, e.g. maspin on chromosome 18.

Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 patterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes In a recent paper in PNAS, Rigoutsos et al. (2006) describe a nonrandom pattern of repeated elements, called pyknons, which are found more frequently in the 3' untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome Discovery of pyknons, the most frequent, variable-length DNA sequence motifs in the human genomes, suggests extensive sequence-based connectivity between non-coding and protein-coding components of human genomes Short blocks from the noncoding parts of the human genome have instances within nearly all known genes and relate to biological processes.

56bf3a79ef6e39474100000f	What is the association of estrogen replacement therapy and intracranial meningioma risk?	The meta-analyses yielded significantly increased risks for all CNS tumors, glioma and meningioma in users of estrogen-only [1.35 (1.22-1.49), 1.23 (1.06-1.42) and 1.31 (1.20-1.43), respectively] but not estrogen-progestin HT [1.09 (0.99-1.19), 0.92 (0.78-1.08) and 1.05 (0.95-1.16), respectively]; these differences were statistically significant (p<0.005 for each tumor type). There was no significant difference between glioma and meningioma risk in users of estrogen-only HT. The totality of the available evidence suggests an increased risk of all CNS tumors (and of glioma and meningioma separately) in users of estrogen-only HT.  Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67).  The relationship between current use of exogenous hormones and meningioma remains unclear, limited by the small numbers of patients currently on oral hormone medications and a lack of hormone receptor data for meningioma tumors. Ever use of estradiol-only therapy was associated with an increased risk of meningioma (standardized incidence ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.44). Among women who had been using estradiol-only therapy for at least 3 years, the incidence of meningioma was 1.40-fold higher (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.64; P<0.001) than in the background population.  Estradiol-only therapy was accompanied with a slightly increased risk of meningioma. Results from several prospective, large-scale studies indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy may increase the risk for diagnosing meningioma by 30-80%, but there is no effect in regard to glioma.  A retrospective study including more than 350,000 women, about 1400 of whom had developed meningioma, showed that the risk of meningioma was about twice as high in users of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy as in non-users. Compared with never users of HRT, the relative risks (RRs) for all incident CNS tumours, gliomas, meningiomas and acoustic neuromas in current users of HRT were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05-1.36), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.89-1.32), 1.34 (95% CI: 1.03-1.75) and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.02-2.45), respectively, and there was no significant difference in the relative risks by tumour type (heterogeneity p = 0.2).  BACKGROUND: Previous studies on association of exogenous female sex hormones and risk for meningioma have yielded conflicting results. RESULTS: Postmenopausal hormonal treatment, use of contraceptives, or fertility treatment did not influence the risk of meningioma.  CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little indication that reproductive factors or use of exogenous sex hormones affect meningioma risk. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.  BACKGROUND: The role of exogenous hormone exposures in the development of meningioma is unclear, but these exposures have been proposed as one hypothesis to explain the over-abundance of such tumors in women. RESULTS: Although risk of meningioma appeared modestly elevated in past OC users (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8 - 2.7), and in current users (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.5 - 12.6), the confidence intervals were wide.  Likewise, risk of meningioma was only weakly associated with past use of HRT (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 - 1.3), and not at all with current use of HRT (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.5 - 2.2).   Overall, in post menopausal women, HRT use appeared to confer a non-significant protective effect, and was not associated with low or high PR expressing meningiomas.CONCLUSION: This study found little evidence of associations between meningioma and exogenous hormone exposures in women but did suggest that some hormonal exposures may influence tumor biology in those women who develop meningioma. The increased odds ratios with African Americans was retained in post-menopausal women, while the protective odds ratios for pregnancy, smoking and oral contraceptives (OCs) became stronger in pre-menopausal women. The pattern by duration and timing of use does not suggest an etiologic role for OCs or hormone replacement therapy.  The use of hormone replacement therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women either with previously treated disease or with dormant tumors is discussed, but remains controversial. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk. OC use was associated with increased risk of a meningioma expressing less rather than more PR (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.3 - 8.0).  In further analysis by hormone receptor status, there was some indication for an increased risk of progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas associated with oral contraceptive use (OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.92-2.10) and other hormonal contraception (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95-2.36).  Several studies indicate that use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma, while associations between HRT use and risk of other brain tumors have been less explored. available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk. A significant positive association existed between meningioma risk and increased body mass index (p &lt; 0.01) while a significant negative association existed between meningioma risk and current smoking (p &lt; 0.01). Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67). A higher risk of meningioma was observed among postmenopausal women who were current users of hormone replacement therapy (HR, Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67). There was no association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.

54ede34694afd61504000004	Which is the genetic cause for the development of Fanconi anemia complementation group D1?	The discovery of biallelic BRCA2 mutations in the FA-D1 complementation group allows for the first time to study the characteristics of primary BRCA2-deficient human cells. Although he lacked a strong family history of cancer, he was subsequently shown to carry biallelic mutations in the FANCD1/BRCA2 gene. These included an IVS7 splice-site mutation, which is strongly associated with early AML in homozygous or compound heterozygous carrier status in FA-D1 patients. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause FA-D1.

Insect odorant receptors function as heteromeric odorant-gated cation channels comprising a conventional odorant-sensitive tuning receptor, and a conserved co-receptor (Orco) Insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor families, including the odorant receptors (ORs), membrane proteins that form heteromeric odour-gated ion channels comprising a variable ligand-selective subunit and an obligate co-receptor called Orco Surprisingly, mutation of the obligate olfactory coreceptor (Orco) does not abolish CO(2) aversion during walking yet eliminates CO(2) tracking in flight.   Most odors are detected via a family of odorant receptors (ORs), which form heteromeric complexes consisting of a well-conserved OR co-receptor (Orco) ion channel and a non-conserved tuning OR that provides coding specificity to each complex. Orco functions as a non-selective cation channel and is expressed in the majority of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).  a novel OR co-receptor (Orco) In insects, odor cues are discriminated through a divergent family of odorant receptors (ORs). A functional OR complex consists of both a conventional odorant-binding OR and a nonconventional coreceptor (Orco) that is highly conserved across insect taxa.  Insect odorant receptors (ORs) function as odorant-gated ion channels consisting of a conventional, odorant-binding OR and the Orco coreceptor. 	['Odorant co-receptor.']
57169a49cb4ef8864c00000a	What is the mechanism of action of decitabine?	The use of the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine (Dacogen®) has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and its clinical effects on solid tumors have gained attention. low-dose decitabine and combined therapy show significant improvement in solid tumor treatment. Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent degradation of Dnmt1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing catalytic site mutant (cys-ser), confirming that the covalent bond formation between Dnmt1 and decitabine-incorporated DNA is not essential for this process. NMT1o, the oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the N-terminal 118-amino acid domain, did not undergo decitabine-mediated degradation, which further proves the requirement of multiple domains including nuclear localization signa Analysis of glycerol density gradient fractions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei showed that both nucleosomal and nucleoplasmic DNMT1 are degraded upon decitabine treatment. The maximal effect caused by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) persuaded us to investigate further its role in decitabine-mediated DNMT1 degradation.  These studies provide substantial evidence that decitabine-induced degradation of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 does not require covalent bond formation with the substrate and also elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Decitabine is a potent demethylating agent that exhibits clinical activity against myeloid malignancies. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. Recent studies indicating that decitabine also induces regional chromatin remodeling of some unmethylated genes suggest additional mechanisms of action. Our findings indicate that decitabine can relieve p21WAF1 repression in AML by a mechanism that involves release of HDAC1 without requiring promoter demethylation. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) can relieve p21WAF1 repression in human acute myeloid leukemia by a mechanism involving release of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) without requiring p21WAF1 promoter demethylation. Decitabine, a demethylating drug, is the first-line treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and gains better overall survival, which is based on epigenetic mechanism Demethylating agent decitabine was reported to be able to up-regulate CTAs through its hypomethylation mechanism, thus enhance the immunogenicity of leukemia cells However, further elucidation of its mechanism of action is required, as clinical response to decitabine does not correlate with demethylation of the p15 gene promoter or the repetitive DNA element LINE.  In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is increasingly used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear.

Humans lack a functional cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) protein and cannot synthesize the sugar Neu5Gc, an innate mammalian signal of self. Losing this sugar changed how humans interact with some of our deadliest pathogens: malaria, influenza, and streptococcus among others. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies are detected in all human sera, though with variable levels and epitope-recognition profiles. These antibodies likely play a role in several inflammation-mediated pathologies including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Human polyclonal IgG antibodies directly against the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are potential biomarkers and mechanistic contributors to cancer and other diseases associated with chronic inflammation.  Human heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal erythrocytes are known to detect the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).  Nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc is very low in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors differentiated with B27/N2 and noggin A concern recently has been raised that human embryonic stem cell (HESC) lines cultured with currently available methods may have limited clinical usefulness due to the immunogenicity of the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc incorporated into their membranes during culturing.

Neu5Gc is synthesized from Neu5Ac by the enzyme cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH). Human cells cannot synthesize Neu5Gc because of dysfunction of the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene but can exogenously and metabolically incorporate Neu5Gc from dietary sources. Finally, we demonstrate that the synthesized Neu5Gc can be incorporated into the cell glycocalyx of human cells, which do not naturally synthesize this sugar.

5713394af9287de436000001	Which is the underlying mechanism for exon skipping used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy?	Antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy is a promising therapeutic approach that uses short DNA-like molecules called antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to skip over/splice out the mutated part of the gene to produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein many DMD patients need exon skipping of multiple exons in order to restore the reading frame, depending on how many base pairs the mutated exon(s) and adjacent exons have. Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD. Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), the disrupted DMD reading frame is restored, allowing generation of partially functional dystrophin and conversion of a severe Duchenne into a milder Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype.  Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting specific exons the DMD reading frame is restored and partially functional dystrophins are produced.

5d35f07b7bc3fee31f000003	What is the function of BRD4?	Brd4-independent transcriptional repression function of the papillomavirus e2 proteins. the cellular bromodomain protein Brd4 as a major E2-interacting protein and established that it participates in tethering bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 and viral genomes to host cell mitotic chromosomes Brd4 mediates E2-dependent transcriptional activation Knockdown of BRD4-NUT in NMC cells disperses the transcriptionally inactive chromatin foci and releases the transcriptional activators to stimulate c-fos expression, leading to restoration of cellular differentiation. Resistance is mediated by the bromodomain protein BRD4, which exhibits altered genome-wide binding patterns in transformation-resistant cells, leading to inhibition of oncogenic dedifferentiation. BRD4 also inhibits, albeit to a lower extent, the tumorigenic potential of transformed cells from healthy individual n important role of bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) in promoting estrogen-regulated transcription and proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells.  Such mechanisms may also render leukemia cells vulnerable to perturbations of transcriptional regulators, which includes small molecules targeting the coactivator protein BRD4. Here we report that the epigenetic reader BRD4 and the methyltransferase G9a repress a TFEB/TFE3/MITF-independent transcriptional program that promotes autophagy and lysosome biogenesis Our recent study revealed that autophagy programs are transcriptionally suppressed by the BET family protein BRD4. BRD4 is a newly characterized transcriptional regulator that represses autophagy and lysosomal function. As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators. Taken together, the newly reported repressive role of BRD4 in autophagy adds to our understanding of how autophagy and lysosome functions are regulated at the transcriptional level. The olfactory bromodomain‑containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a protein that recognizes and binds acetylated lysine. It has been reported that the high expression of BRD4 is involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy.

Inn1 and Cyk3 regulate chitin synthase during cytokinesis in budding yeasts Our data support a model in which the C2-domain of Inn1 acts in conjunction with Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of Chs2 during cytokinesis. Cdc14-dependent dephosphorylation of Inn1 contributes to Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation Cdc14 colocalizes with Inn1 at the cell division site and interacts with the C-terminal proline-rich domain of Inn1 that mediates its binding to the SH3-domain-containing proteins Hof1 and Cyk3. We show that phosphorylation of Inn1 by Cdk1 partially perturbs the interaction of Inn1 with Cyk3 thereby reducing the levels of Cyk3 at the cell division site. We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis Targeted localization of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 by the mitotic-exit network regulates cytokinesis in budding yeast Cyk3 acts in actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis by recruiting Inn1 to the yeast bud neck Role of Inn1 and its interactions with Hof1 and Cyk3 in promoting cleavage furrow and septum formation in S. cerevisiae we identified a novel factor that we call Inn1, which associates with the contractile actomyosin ring at the end of mitosis and is needed for cytokinesis.

We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis. Inn1 and Cyk3 regulate chitin synthase during cytokinesis in budding yeasts. Cyk3 acts in actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis by recruiting Inn1 to the yeast bud neck. Inn1 couples contraction of the actomyosin ring to membrane ingression during cytokinesis in budding yeast. Targeted localization of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 by the mitotic-exit network regulates cytokinesis in budding yeast. We therefore propose that the MEN directly controls cytokinesis via targeting of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 to the bud neck. Our data support a model in which the C2-domain of Inn1 acts in conjunction with Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of Chs2 during cytokinesis. In addition to compensating for mutations in the Inn1 C2-domain, the dominant CHS2 alleles suppress cytokinesis defects produced by the lack of the Cyk3 protein. We propose that Cyk3 is part of an actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis pathway, which acts as a rescue mechanism to recruit Inn1 to the bud neck. We previously found that the C2-domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Inn1 protein plays an essential but uncharacterised role at the cleavage site during cytokinesis.

54dfcdf81388e8454a00000a	What is the mechanism of action of APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase to inhibit HIV-1 replication?	APOBEC3G inhibits HIV-1 RNA elongation by inactivating the viral trans-activation response element Deamination of cytidine residues in viral DNA is a major mechanism by which APOBEC3G (A3G) inhibits vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. dC-to-dU transition following RNase-H activity leads to viral cDNA degradation, production of non-functional proteins, formation of undesired stop codons and decreased viral protein synthesis HIV-1 transcription elongation is regulated by the trans-activation response (TAR) element, a short stem-loop RNA structure required for elongation factors binding. Vif-deficient HIV-1-infected cells accumulate short viral transcripts and produce lower amounts of full-length HIV-1 transcripts due to A3G deamination of the TAR apical loop cytidine, highlighting the requirement for TAR loop integrity in HIV-1 transcription The APOBEC3 deoxycytidine deaminase family functions as host restriction factors that can block replication of Vif (virus infectivity factor) deficient HIV-1 virions to differing degrees by deaminating cytosines to uracils in single-stranded (-)HIV-1 DNA. Upon replication of the (-)DNA to (+)DNA, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase incorporates adenines opposite the uracils, thereby inducing C/G→T/A mutations that can functionally inactivate HIV-1 APOBEC3G is a member of this family that inhibits HIV-1 replication in the absence of the viral infectivity factor Vif. Inhibition of HIV replication occurs by both deamination of viral single-stranded DNA and a deamination-independent mechanism Suppression of HIV-1 infection by APOBEC3 proteins in primary human CD4(+) T cells is associated with inhibition of processive reverse transcription as well as excessive cytidine deamination These proteins exert their suppressive effects through the inhibition of viral reverse transcription as well as the induction of cytidine deamination within nascent viral cDNA We demonstrate that APOBEC3 proteins impart a profound deficiency to reverse transcription from the initial stages of cDNA synthesis, as well as excessive cytidine deamination (hypermutation) of the DNAs that are synthesized Without Vif, A3 proteins, particularly APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), inhibit HIV-1 replication by blocking reverse transcription and/or integration and hypermutating nascent viral cDNA. The molecular mechanisms of this antiviral activity have been primarily attributed to two biochemical characteristics common to A3 proteins: catalyzing cytidine deamination in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a nucleic acid-binding capability that is specific to ssDNA or ssRNA A host cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3G (A3G), inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by incorporating into virions in the absence of the virally encoded Vif protein (Deltavif virions), at least in part by causing G-to-A hypermutation. APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G cytidine deaminases potently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by enzymatically inserting G-to-A mutations in viral DNA and/or impairing viral reverse transcription independently of their deaminase activity	['During reverse transcription, APOBEC3G deaminates dC to dU in nascent minus-strand viral DNA, resulting in G-to-A hypermutation in the plus strand DNA to inhibit replication of HIV-1, due to viral cDNA degradation, production of non-functional proteins, formation of undesired stop codons and decreased viral protein synthesis. In an additional line of antiviral defense, APOBEC3G induces deamination of the apical loop cytidine of the trans-activation response (TAR) element, a short stem-loop RNA structure required for binding of elongation factors during HIV-1 transcription elongation, resulting in accumulation of short viral transcripts and production of lower amounts of full-length HIV-1 transcripts in Vif-deficient HIV-1-infected cells.']

5507ea9a0195c16935000008	What type of arrhythmia is known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BDVT)?	Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with alternating polarity of the QRS complex most commonly described digitalis toxicity.  Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity. Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively. When the heart rate exceeded the threshold for bigeminy at the first site in the His-Purkinje system, ventricular bigeminy developed, causing the heart rate to accelerate and exceed the threshold for bigeminy at the second site. Thus, the triggered beat from the first site induced a triggered beat from the second site. The triggered beat from the second site next reciprocated by inducing a triggered beat from the first site, and so forth. Bigeminy from two sites produced BVT, and that from three or more sites produced polymorphic VT. This "ping pong" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy. The BVT, in this case, was most likely due to myocardial ischema. The ethiology of published BVT cases are most commonly digitalis toxicity and rarely herbal aconitine poisoning, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, cathecolaminergic VT, myocarditis, and Anderson-Tawil syndrome. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), although a rare arrhythmia in the general population, is frequently observed in patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome and long QT interval. However, the pharmacologic treatment of this arrhythmia remains unknown. This report suggests that flecainide can be effective in controlling BVT associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome and indicates that the left ventricular dysfunction is secondary to the arrhythmia and not due to an associated phenotypic manifestation of the disorder. Based on similarity of electrocardiographic features, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia has been considered a variant of long QT syndrome. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, defined as the rapid alternation of the QRS complexes with successive opposing axial deviation, is a rare arrhythmia. In the rare cases which have undergone endocavitary investigations, an infrahisian origin has generally been proved. However, the mechanism of these tachycardias remains poorly understood and is discussed with respect to a new case. In the light of previously reported cases with documented endocavitary investigation and this new case, it seems possible to talk in terms of true "bidirectional ventricular tachycardia", a tachycardia whose mechanism is obscure but certainly not univocal. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with alternating polarity of the QRS complex most commonly described digitalis toxicity. BACKGROUND: Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity.

Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT). Based on similarity of electrocardiographic features, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia has been considered a variant of long QT syndrome. Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively. This "ping pong" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy.']

Reduced dosage of ERF causes complex craniosynostosis in humans and mice and links ERK1/2 signaling to regulation of osteogenesis we show that reduced dosage of ERF, which encodes an inhibitory ETS transcription factor directly bound by ERK1/2 (refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7), causes complex craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures) in humans and mice.

Fractality and entropic scaling in the chromosomal distribution of conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. We explored the chromosomal distribution of different classes of CNEs in the human genome. We employed two methodologies: the scaling of block entropy and box-counting, with the aim to assess fractal characteristics of different CNE datasets. Both approaches converged to the conclusion that well-developed fractality is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution.  Conserved noncoding elements follow power-law-like distributions in several genomes as a result of genome dynamics. We find widespread power-law-like distributions, i.e. linearity in double logarithmic scale, in the inter-CNE distances, a feature which is connected with fractality and self-similarity.

5a82fc89faa1ab7d2e000028	Which yeast nucleosomes are preferentially marked by H2A.Z?	The H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes have different sequence preferences. The shifted peaks coincide with DNA regions interacting with the histone loops. Deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z at gene bodies regulates transcription by modifying chromatin accessibility in plants. We showed that H2A.Z preferentially associated with H3K4me3 at promoters, while it was found with H3K27me3 at enhancers, and that H2A.Z deposition negatively correlated with gene expression. In addition, we demonstrated that H2A.Z represses gene expression by establishing low gene accessibility at +1 nucleosome and maintaining high gene accessibility at -1 nucleosome. We further showed that the high measures of gene responsiveness correlate with the H2A.Z-associated closed +1 nucleosome structure. In particular, replacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z has been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; Using genome-wide nucleosome maps and histone variant occupancy in the mouse liver, we show that the majority of genes were associated with a single prominent H2A.Z containing nucleosome in their promoter region Proximity of H2A.Z containing nucleosome to the transcription start site influences gene expression levels in the mammalian liver and brain The genes with no detectable H2A.Z showed lowest expression level, whereas H2A.Z was positioned closer to the TSS of genes with higher expression levels. The proximity of histone variant H2A.Z, but not H3.3 to the TSS, over seven consecutive nucleosomes, was correlated with expression  Our results suggest that gene expression levels in vivo are determined by accessibility of the TSS and proximity of H2A.Z. We also find that human H2A.Z nucleosomes protect only approximately 120 bp of DNA from MNase digestion and exhibit specific sequence preferences, suggesting a novel mechanism of nucleosome organization for the H2A.Z variant. Variant histone H2A.Z is globally localized to the promoters of inactive yeast genes and regulates nucleosome positioning. We have identified 4,862 small regions--typically one or two nucleosomes wide--decorated with H2A.Z. Those "Z loci" are predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all across the genome. Genome-wide profiling of Anp32e revealed a remarkable co-occupancy between Anp32e and H2A.Z. Cells overexpressing Anp32e displayed a strong global H2A.Z loss at the +1 nucleosomes, whereas cells depleted of Anp32e displayed a moderate global H2A.Z increase at the +1 nucleosomes. This suggests that Anp32e may help to resolve the non-nucleosomal H2A.Z aggregates and also facilitate the removal of H2A.Z at the +1 nucleosomes, and the latter may help RNA polymerase II to pass the first nucleosomal barrier. Although distinct epigenetic marks correlate with different chromatin states, how they are integrated within single nucleosomes to generate combinatorial signals remains largely unknown. We report the successful implementation of single molecule tools constituting fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), pulse interleave excitation-based Förster resonance energy transfer (PIE-FRET) and fluorescence lifetime imaging-based FRET (FLIM-FRET) to elucidate the composition of single nucleosomes containing histone variant H2A.Z (Htz1p in yeast) in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that yeast nucleosomes containing Htz1p are primarily composed of H4 K12ac and H3 K4me3 but not H3 K36me3 and that these patterns are conserved in mammalian cells.

5a7610ca83b0d9ea6600001b	What is the role of nimotuzumab in treatment of pontine glioma?	Targeted therapy protocols included radiation therapy along with treatment by erlotinib, cilengitide, or an association of nimotuzumab and vinblastine. . We found that nimotuzumab with or without radiotherapy, chemotherapy in newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), might improve the response rate or the survival time. In conclusion, nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug with acceptable toxicity, and it may have promising value in the combination treatment. Time to progression following initiation of nimotuzumab for the 4 patients with SD or better at W18 was 119, 157, 182 and 335 days, respectively. Median survival time was 3.2 months. Two patients lived 663 and 481 days from the start of nimotuzumab.CONCLUSIONS: Modest activity of nimotuzumab in DIPG, which has been shown previously, was confirmed: A small subset of DIPG patients appeared to benefit from anti-EGFR antibody treatment. Additionally, 1 patient received nimotuzumab once per week.  Findings on the role of EGFR signaling in the onset of childhood DIPG prompted the use of nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody.   The nimotuzumab/vinorelbine combination was very well tolerated, with no acute side-effects.  This strategy generated interesting results and warrants further investigation. Combining craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab therapy may slightly improve tumor control and overall survival.  Here, we describe the case of an 8-year-old girl with primary metastatic DIPG who received craniospinal radiotherapy, a local boost, and concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab treatment based on an individual therapy recommendation.  The most frequently used drugs were etoposide (14), bevacizumab (13), irinotecan (13), nimotuzumab (13), and valproic acid (13). Recent studies of nimotuzumab indicate the reason for the lack of toxicity, which is the most attractive argument for its clinical use besides modest efficacy. . Studies are also ongoing in pediatric HGG with 2 EGFR inhibitors: cetuximab and nimotuzumab.

5172e9448ed59a060a000018	Other than protein coding potential, what features set apart long non-coding RNAs from protein coding genes?	Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts hey are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. he proportion of conserved sequence (4.1%-5.5%) in these macroRNAs is comparable to the density of exons within protein-coding transcripts (5.2%). These macroRNAs, taken together, thus possess the imprint of purifying selection, thereby indicating their functionality.	['Compared to protein coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display a bias towards two-exon transcripts. They are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleous.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular senescence. In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear Our study indicates a causal effect of PAI-1 on human longevity, which may be mediated by alterations in metabolism PAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women.  However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.

Regulatory Trait Concordance (RTC) that accounts for local LD structure and integrates eQTLs and GWAS results in order to reveal the subset of association signals that are due to cis eQTLs.  After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs.  We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect.

5e4606c03f54159529000004	Describe Twiddler Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Twiddler's, reel, and ratchet syndromes are rare entities responsible for lead displacement of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). The twiddler syndrome results in retraction and coiling of the lead in the pacemaker pocket with subsequent pacemaker malfunction. Twiddler syndrome is described as a spontaneous rotation or intentional external manipulation of implanted cardiac or occasionally deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices.  Twiddler's syndrome is a rare cause of pacemaker electrode displacement.  Twiddler syndrome is uncommon in children and most commonly described as causing lead retraction with implanted cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.  Twiddler syndrome is a form of pacemaker lead dislocation caused by the coiling of the pacemaker leads due to pulse generator rotation on its long axis.  On chest X-ray coiling of both atrial and ventricular leads was noted and caused inadvertently by active shoulder-arm physiotherapy.  Twiddler's syndrome, a rare but potentially lethal complication of cardiac pacemaker treatment, is generally diagnosed within the first year of implantation. It is characterized by device malfunction due to dislodgement of cardiac leads resulting from some form of manipulation by the patient. Twiddler syndrome is described as a spontaneous rotation or intentional external manipulation of implanted cardiac or occasionally deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices. Twiddler syndrome with a twist: a cause of vagal nerve stimulator lead fracture. Twiddler syndrome occurs when a patient intentionally or unintentionally manipulates an implantable generator (usually a pacemaker) and dislodges the pacing leads, causing malfunction of the device.

This pilot study examined gene expression signatures in pathological gingival tissues of subjects with chronic or aggressive periodontitis, and explored whether new subclasses of periodontitis can be identified based on gene expression profiles. A total of 14 patients, seven with chronic and seven with aggressive periodontitis, were examined with respect to clinical periodontal status, composition of subgingival bacterial plaque assessed by checkerboard hybridizations, and levels of serum IgG antibodies to periodontal bacteria assayed by checkerboard immunoblotting. In addition, at least two pathological pockets/patient were biopsied, processed for RNA extraction, amplification and labeling, and used to study gene expression using Affymetrix U-133 A arrays. Based on a total of 35 microarrays, no significantly different gene expression profiles appeared to emerge between chronic and aggressive periodontitis. However, a de novo grouping of the 14 subjects into two fairly robust clusters was possible based on similarities in gene expression. These two groups had similar clinical periodontal status and subgingival bacterial profiles, but differed significantly with respect to serum IgG levels against the important periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Campylobacter rectus. These early data point to the usefulness of gene expression profiling techniques in the identification of subclasses of periodontitis with common pathobiology Gene ontology analysis identified 61 differentially expressed groups (adjusted P <0.05), including apoptosis, antimicrobial humoral response, antigen presentation, regulation of metabolic processes, signal transduction, and angiogenesis	['Aggressive periodontitis does not differ from chronic periodontitis from a microbial profile point of view but there are distinctive immunological signatures, including a higher expression in IgG against most periodontal pathogens and a more intense regulatory mechanism of metabolic processes.']
532f043ed6d3ac6a34000023	what is the role of MEF-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation?	The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Gene expression profiling revealed decreased levels of transcription factors transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein, serum response factor, GATA4, and myocyte enhancer factor 2, linked to increased Ca(2+)-dependent calcineurin activity and Notch1 signaling that impaired ESC differentiation. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy. Hypertrophic agonist stimulation of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes increased Mef2 expression by enhancing its translation, without changing its transcription or blocking degradation of the protein. MEF2 abundance was increased by Calcineurin overexpression in vivo and was reduced by Calcineurin inhibition in vitro, without affecting Mef2 mRNA levels. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed association of Gli2 to the Mef2c gene, and of MEF2C to the Gli2 gene in differentiating P19 cells. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins formed a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters containing both Gli- and MEF2-binding elements. We propose a model whereby Gli2 and MEF2C bind each other's regulatory elements, activate each other's expression and form a protein complex that synergistically activates transcription, enhancing cardiac muscle development.  MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors is not only important for controlling gene expression in normal cellular programs, like muscle differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synaptic differentiation, but has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions.  Furthermore, the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptor) stimulated the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 towards MEF2 and PCAF. Supporting the physical interaction and deacetylase activity, HDAC3 repressed MEF2-dependent transcription and inhibited myogenesis.  The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined.  Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). We provide evidence that MEF2 proteins are recruited to target promoters by the cell-specific GATA transcription factors, and that MEF2 potentiates the transcriptional activity of this family of tissue-restricted zinc finger proteins. During differentiation into cardiac muscle, Nkx2-5 expression resulted in the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), but not MEF2A, -B, or -D Similar to Nkx2-5, MEF2C expression initiated cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. These findings indicate the presence of a positive regulatory network between Nkx2-5 and MEF2C and show that both factors can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.

N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide levels as a predictor of functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. There was a strong positive correlation between the plasma level of NT-proBNP and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (r=0.415, P=0.000). Plasma levels of NT-proBNP in patients with an unfavorable outcome were significantly higher than those in patients with a favorable outcome [3432 (interquartile range, 1100-54991) vs. 978 (interquartile range, 123-1705) pg/ml; P=0.000]. In multivariate analyses, after adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, the NT-proBNP level that remained can be seen as an independent unfavorable outcome predictor, with an adjusted odds ratios of 4.14 (95% confidence interval, 2.72-7.99; P=0.000). Our results show that plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome and might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for the assessment of functional outcomes in patients with AIS. Plasma levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin were associated with stroke severity, as well as short-term functional outcomes. After adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin remained as independent outcome predictors. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the biomarker panel (including BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin) predicted functional outcome and death within 90 days significantly more efficiently than the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the biomarker alone. The NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher at 4 intervals after ischemic stroke than in healthy and at-risk control subjects (all p<0.001).  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and NIH Stroke Scale were the 2 strongest independent predictors of increased NT-proBNP levels (all p<0.01). Furthermore, increased NT-proBNP (> or = 150 pg/ml) was the strongest independent predictor of long-term (mean follow-up: 24 months) UFCO (26 patients) (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The NT-proBNP level was markedly elevated after acute ischemic stroke and declined substantially thereafter. An increased NT-proBNP level was strongly and independently correlated with UFCO in patients after ischemic stroke.	['ProBNP serum concentrations are elevated in stroke patients relative to healthy controls. Greater proBNP serum concentrations are associated with greater stroke severity and with increased risk for unfvorable functional outcomes.']

58848822e56acf517600000c	What is the mechanism of action of Osimertinib?	In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib).  Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are presently in clinical use. Understanding resistance mechanisms has led to the identification of a secondary mutational target, T790M, in more than half of patients, for which osimertinib has been approved.  Third-generation EGFR TKIs against the T790M mutation have been in active clinical development. These agents include osimertinib, rociletinib, HM61713, ASP8273, EGF816, and PF-06747775.  PURPOSE: Osimertinib (AZD9291) 80 mg once daily is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC whose disease has previously progressed on EGFR-TKI therapy. Osimertinib PK was evaluated to define the dose and dosing interval, whether a fixed-dosing approach can be used globally, and the impact of formulation and food on exposure. RECENT FINDINGS: Third-generation TKIs in clinical development include osimertinib, rociletinib, and HM61713. In this study, we investigated the interaction between ABCB1 and osimertinib, a novel selective, irreversible third-generation EGFR TKI that has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Considering that osimertinib is a clinically approved third-generation EGFR TKI, our findings suggest that a combination therapy with osimertinib and conventional anticancer drugs may be beneficial to patients with MDR tumors. In our study, we investigated whether osimertinib (AZD9291), a third-generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both activating EGFR mutations and resistance-associated T790M point mutation, could reverse MDR induced by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo Our results showed that osimertinib significantly increased the sensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cells to their substrate chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in the model of ABCB1-overexpressing KBv200 cell xenograft in nude mice.  The potency of 1st (erlotinib), 2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express mutated or wild type EGFR Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso™), an oral, third-generation EGFR TKI, has been designed to target the EGFR T790M mutation, while sparing wild-type EGFR. Early phase clinical data suggest the third generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib, rociletinib, and HM61713 are highly efficacious and well tolerated. We review the rapid clinical development and approval of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib for treatment of NSCLCs with EGFR-T790M.

When TFs are bound to active regulatory regions, they displace canonical nucleosomes, making these regions biochemically detectable as nucleosome-depleted regions or accessible/open chromatin. Here we ask whether open chromatin profiling can be used to identify the entire repertoire of active promoters and enhancers underlying tissue-specific gene expression during normal development and oncogenesis in vivo. To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin.

The treatment of choice for localized primary GI lymphoma is controversial. Complete surgical resection may increase the chance of complete remission, but mortality and relapse rates might be higher than those observed with combination chemotherapy alone. The most common gastric lymphoma are low-grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL) of MALT type. In early stages of disease, H. pylori eradication alone may lead to complete lymphoma remission in up to 75% of cases. Nonresponder or locally advanced lymphoma should be treated with radiation therapy. Advanced lymphoma may be treated with the nucleoside analogon cladribine within clinical trials In patients with primary gastric diffuse large cell lymphoma and aggressive histology, diffuse large cell lymphoma in early stage SCT achieved good results, but surgery was associated with some cases of lethal complications. Thus it appears that CT should be considered the treatment of choice in this patient setting. Controversy remains regarding the best treatment for primary gastric lymphoma (PGL). Recent developments in diagnosis and chemotherapy have changed strategies for this disease. With the exception of eradication therapy in H. pylori-positive low-grade lymphoma of stage EI and the subgroup of locally advanced high-grade lymphoma, resection remains the treatment of choice.  The treatment of primary gastric lymphoma is controversial. The role of surgery has come to be questioned with increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of gastric lymphoma and with new therapeutic approaches such as eradication of Helicobacter pylori. curative resection is the treatment of choice for gastric lymphoma, but radiation therapy may offer some benefit when complete resection is not feasible.

The results presented here demonstrate that KP4 and three plant defensins, MsDef1, MtDef2, and RsAFP2, all inhibit root growth in germinating Arabidopsis seeds at low micromolar concentrations . There are three well-characterized killer toxins in U. maydis-KP1, KP4, and KP6-which are secreted by the P1, P4, and P6 subtypes, respectively. These killer toxins are small polypeptides encoded by segments of an endogenous, persistent double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus in each U. maydis subtype. The viral gene for the killer protein 4 (KP4) has been explored for its antifungal effect antifungal protein KP4 from Ustilago maydis-infecting virus The antifungal activity correlated with the presence of the KP4 transgene. These results suggest that KP4 may inhibit cell growth and division by blocking calcium-regulated signal transduction pathways. KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis. KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis. Our results defining the type of mammalian channel affected by this fungal toxin further support our contention that KP4 inhibits fungal growth by blocking transmembrane calcium flux through fungal calcium channels, Killer toxins are polypeptides secreted by some fungal species that kill sensitive cells of the same or related species. In the best-characterized cases, they function by creating new pores in the cell membrane and disrupting ion fluxes KP4 is a virally encoded and highly specific toxin that kills fungi closely related to the fungus Ustilago maydis. The P4 strain of the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis, secretes a fungal toxin, KP4, encoded by a fungal virus (UMV4) that persistently infects its cells. These results led to experiments demonstrating that the toxin specifically inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mammalian cells. Ustilago maydis killer toxins are small polypeptides (7-14 kDa) which kill susceptible cells of closely related fungal species. The KP4 toxin is a single polypeptide subunit with a molecular weight of 11.1 kDa	['The virally encoded fungal toxin KP4  specifically blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.']

5aacd83ffcf4565872000008	What is PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance?	PARPi has been designed and tested for many years and became a potential supplement for the conventional chemotherapy. However, increasing evidence indicates the appearance of the resistance to this treatment. Specifically, cancer cells may acquire new mutations or events that overcome the positive effect of these drugs. Recent studies have shown that PARP-1 could be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive in different cancers. PARP inhibitor resistance is also a growing concern in the clinical setting. Recently, changes in the levels of PARP-1 activity or expression in cancer patients have provided the basis for consideration of PARP-1 regulatory proteins as potential biomarkers.  However, emerging data have also shown that even BRCA-mutant cells may be resistant to PARPi. The mechanistic basis for these drug resistances is poorly understood.

5c65ae757c78d6947100000a	Describe the bartender algorithm	Bartender: a fast and accurate clustering algorithm to count barcode reads. Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing-from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data.Results: In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.Availability and implementation: Bartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1.

5e3e8b1c48dab47f26000008	What are the effects of 14-3-3 dimers on Tau phosphorylation?	Proteomic, biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate that both Drosophila 14-3-3 proteins interact with human wild-type and mutant Tau on multiple sites irrespective of their phosphorylation state. 14-3-3 dimers regulate steady-state phosphorylation of both wild-type and the R406W mutant Tau, but they are not essential for toxicity of either variant. Moreover, 14-3-3 elevation itself is not pathogenic, but recruitment of dimers on accumulating wild-type Tau increases its steady-state levels ostensibly by occluding access to proteases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contrast, the R406W mutant, which lacks a putative 14-3-3 binding site, responds differentially to elevation of each 14-3-3 isoform. Although excess 14-3-3ζ stabilizes the mutant protein, elevated D14-3-3ɛ has a destabilizing effect probably because of altered 14-3-3 dimer composition.

5abc9c1efcf4565872000020	How are deletion breakpoints defined?	Molecular mapping of deletion breakpoints on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we investigated the deletion breakpoints of the parkin mutations in 22 families with AR-JP and examined the possible association between these deletion events and meiotic recombinations. We identified 18 deletion breakpoints at the DNA nucleotide sequence level.  Hemizygotic deletions or duplications in the large Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD gene responsible for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are routinely identified using multiple ligation probe amplification and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Commonly used methods for the detection of CNV breakpoints include long-range PCR and primer walking, their success being limited by the deletion size, GC content and presence of DNA repeats. he hemizygous deletion of exons 45-50 in the DMD gene and the large autosomal heterozygous PARK2 deletion were used to demonstrate the workflow that relies on real-time quantitative PCR to narrow down the deletion region and Sanger sequencing for breakpoint confirmation.  Specifically, (AT)n, (GAA)n and (GAAA)n constitute the most frequent repeats at translocation breakpoints, whereas A-tracts occur preferentially at deletion breakpoints Using this approach, we have efficiently defined the proximal and distal breakpoints in two cytogenetic cases, one duplication and one deletion, to within 5-20 kb. The results support the potential use of BAC-based PCR fragments to further improve the resolution of the microarray-CGH strategy by an order of magnitude. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. In this investigation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing were used to isolate the deletion breakpoints, utilizing the newly available dog genome sequence. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. We used paralog-specific primers and long-range PCR to clone, sequence, and examine the distal deletion breakpoints from two patients with de novo deletions mapping to these distal LCRs. To define the Thailand deletion breakpoints, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the normal-sequence DNA fragments across the breakpoints.

We develop a statistical framework that uses a distance-based approach to compute the variability of splicing ratios across observations, and a non-parametric analogue to multivariate analysis of variance. We implement this approach in the R package sQTLseekeR and use it to analyze RNA-Seq data from the Geuvadis project in 465 individuals. We identify hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), including some falling in genome-wide association study SNPs. By developing the appropriate metrics, we show that sQTLseekeR compares favorably with existing methods that rely on univariate approaches, predicting variants that behave as expected from mutations affecting splicing Identification of genetic variants associated with alternative splicing using sQTLseekeR Identification of genetic variants associated with alternative splicing using sQTLseekeR.
