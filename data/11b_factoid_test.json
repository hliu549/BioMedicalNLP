Recurrent variants were established to be de novo in nine cases and shown to affect highly conserved residues within the lamin \u0251-helical rod domain, likely disrupting interactions required for higher-order assembly of lamin filaments.CONCLUSION: We identify dominant pathogenic variants in LMNB1 and LMNB2 as a genetic cause of primary microcephaly, implicating a major structural component of the nuclear envelope in its etiology and defining a new form of laminopathy. The distinct nature of this lamin B-associated phenotype highlights the strikingly different developmental requirements for lamin paralogs and suggests a novel mechanism for primary microcephaly warranting future investigation.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033404", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 0, "offsetInEndSection": 101, "text": "Heterozygous lamin B1 and lamin B2 variants cause primary microcephaly and define a novel laminopathy", "beginSection": "title", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33033404", "endSection": "title"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 913, "offsetInEndSection": 1137, "text": "identify dominant pathogenic variants in LMNB1 and LMNB2 as a genetic cause of primary microcephaly, implicating a major structural component of the nuclear envelope in its etiology and defining a new form of laminopathy.

The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression.
