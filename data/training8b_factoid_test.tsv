Different combinations and new formulations of cytotoxic agents, such as clofarabine or CPX-351, are newer options for specific subsets of patients. Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Discovery of AG-120 (Ivosidenib): A First-in-Class Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of IDH1 Mutant Cancers. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo.   Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. A phase I study suggests that ivosidenib can induce remission in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia characterized by IDH1 mutations. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). The FDA approved ivosidenib for patients with IDH1-mutant relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.  Ivosidenib (TibsovoÂ®) is a small molecule, orally available inhibitor of mutated cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that is being developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer in patients with IDH1 mutations. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ivosidenib leading to this first approval in the USA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation.

5171438a8ed59a060a000007	What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?	Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S). In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i.e. MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T). RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCR Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The germline mutation was detected because of the systematic genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, which is useful for genetic counseling of potential risk of HSCR and MTC in other family members. This family could be added to the small worldwide cohort of families with MEN2A/FMTC-HSCR. Germline mutations of the ret protooncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and a proportion of cases of HSCR. In this report, we describe a new kindred in which the MEN2 and HSCR phenotypes are associated with a single C620S point mutation at one of the cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the ret protooncogene. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene.	['Ret']

54f5bc7d5f206a0c06000001	What is the function of caspases?	Caspases are the ultimate executors of the apoptotic programmed cell death pathway. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases coordinate the morphological and biochemical events that typify apoptosis.  Caspase function is known to be essential for cell death by apoptosis, Caspases, initially identified as a family of proteases regulating cell death, have been found to have nonapoptotic functions as well. . As in other organisms, apoptosis is executed by caspases. Caspases are intracellular proteases that propagate programmed cell death, proliferation, and inflammation.  Apoptosis is dependent upon caspase activation leading to substrate cleavage and, ultimately, cell death. Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that constitute the effector arm of the apoptotic machinery. Caspases are critical mediators of apoptosis, the principle mechanism by which extra and harmful cells are eliminated to ensure proper development and maintain cellular homeostasis in all multicellular organisms.  Caspases (cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases) are at the core of the cell's suicide machinery. These enzymes, once activated, dismantle the cell by selectively cleaving key proteins after aspartate residues.  Programmed cell death plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis during animal development, and has been conserved in animals as different as nematodes and humans.

5e36dc8cb5b409ea5300000d	What is another name for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)?	Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMd, Niemann-Pick disease A/B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B).  Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficient Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene. The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form.  BACKGROUND  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Introduction  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase.

53148a07dae131f847000002	Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?	Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary among affected individuals and seem to be partially dependent on nutritional iodide intake. Elucidation of the molecular basis of Pendred syndrome and the function of pendrin has provided unexpected novel insights into the pathophysiology of the inner ear, thyroid hormone synthesis, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange in the kidney. Thyroid goiter was found in 46.5% of cases. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter. From age 15 years, her thyroid gland showed progressive enlargement accompanied by elevation of serum thyroglobulin reaching 10-fold the normal amount.  In summary, a molecularly confirmed PS patient showed goiter progression accompanied by elevated serum thyroglobulin and increased thyroidal iodine uptake, but normal serum TSH levels and normal iodine organification. A coherent organization of differentiation proteins is required to maintain an appropriate thyroid function in the Pendred thyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial organification defect of iodide.  The clinical phenotype of patients with Pendred syndrome and the fact that pendrin can mediate iodide efflux in transfected cells suggest that this anion exchanger may be involved in mediating iodide efflux into the follicular lumen, a key step in thyroid hormone biosynthesis.  Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapidly increase pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid cells.  These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it may have a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, coding for the anion transporter pendrin, are responsible for Pendred syndrome, characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness and dyshormonogenic goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial defect in iodide organification. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary and appear to depend on nutritional iodide intake.  Pendrin is mainly expressed in the thyroid, the inner ear, and the kidney. In the thyroid, pendrin localizes to the apical membrane of thyrocytes, where it may be involved in mediating iodide efflux.  Mutations of SLC26A4 cause an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, nonsyndromic deafness, and deafness as part of Pendred syndrome. SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney.  Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister. Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndromes, e.g. Pendred syndrome (PS) and resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct bilaterally. The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a diagnosis of PS. This is the first report of the cooccurrence, in the same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment. Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. Biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene lead to Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Thyroidectomy in a patient with multinodular dyshormonogenetic goitre--a case of Pendred syndrome confirmed by mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene. We report a young woman with genetically confirmed Pendred syndrome and discuss the current therapeutic strategies of dyshormonogenetic goitre. Management of a patient with Pendred syndrome requires careful follow-up and regular imaging of the thyroid.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment, presence of goiter, and a partial defect in iodide organification, which may be associated with insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis. Goiter development and development of hypothyroidism are variable and depend on nutritional iodide intake. Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and a partial iodine organification defect.  Levels of thyroid hormones were essentially normal in all patients: 2 patients had goiters and/or elevated serum thyroglobulin levels, whereas 2 other patients had positive thyroid antibodies and a positive perchlorate discharge test.  Pendred syndrome, defined as the constellation of goiter, sensori-neural hearing loss, and positive perchlorate discharge test, is the most frequent cause of congenital deafness.  Presuming the classic triad as the gold standard, we compared MRI findings in six such defined patients with six cases having goiter, hearing loss, and normal perchlorate discharge test.  For over 100 years after the first description of the disorder, the molecular pathology underlying the deafness and thyroid pathology in Pendred syndrome (PS) remained unknown.  We review the literature to identify genetic defects involved in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from circulation into the thyroid cell, defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell to the follicular lumen (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification. Among those causing dyshormonogenesis, the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes were initially described, and more recently PDS (Pendred syndrome), NIS (sodium iodide symporter), and THOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2) gene defects.  Among permanent CH cases, those with a goitre (n = 27) had an iodine organification defect (n = 10), Pendred syndrome (n = 1), a defect of thyroglobulin synthesis (n = 8), or a defect of sodium iodine symporter (n = 1), and in seven patients no aetiology could be determined. Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid.  Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations.  The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Two patients were hypothyroid, two individuals were euthyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and thyroid goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association between sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid swelling or goitre and is likely to be the most common form of syndromic deafness.  Pendred syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter).

58eb99f3eda5a57672000009	Do origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire early or late?	Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components.  Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins.  We propose that by promoting replication fork integrity under these conditions Rad53 ensures centromere duplication.  Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s). Mutations in two of these LCS (linear chromosome stability) genes had little or no effect on the loss rate of a circular YAC that had the same centromere and origin of replication as present on the linear YA Lack of positional requirements for autonomously replicating sequence elements on artificial yeast chromosomes. We find that terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? Because the activation time of individual origins is not an intrinsic property of S. cerevisiae origins, but is influenced by surrounding sequences, we sought to test the hypothesis that centromeres influence replication time by moving a centromere to a late replication domain. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? In Candida albicans, a neocentromere contains an early firing origin, supporting the first hypothesis but not addressing whether the new origin is intrinsically early firing or whether the centromere influences replication time. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L.

5150b807d24251bc05000072	How many clinical trials for off-label drugs in neonates are cited in the literature.	Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis.	['none', '0', 'zero']
58a342e760087bc10a00001c	Can you define iatrogenic disease?	Iatrogenic neurologic deficits after lumbar spine surgery are rare complications, but important to recognize and manage. However, we analyze its etiology in order to determine if it is from iatrogenic causes. This syndrome can be categorized as follows: mistaken diagnoses, transoperative error, technique error, poor application, poor indication However, the clinical events that occur during iatrogenic immunosuppression (transplantation and cancer therapy) and as a result of immunocompromise due to human immunodeficiency virus infection are currently promoting our understanding of the epidemiology of CMV disease and the definition of its clinical spectrum The authors observed one case of an iatrogenic subarachnoid-pleural fistula secondary to the resection of an upper lobe carcinoma of the lung. Radiological procedures require the intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media, which are becoming a great source of an iatrogenic disease known as contrast-induced nephropathy.  Many studies have reported that AED therapy is associated with metabolic bone disease and is a major iatrogenic risk factor for fractures.  The aetiology of arrhythmias can be either iatrogenic, such as postsurgical, Iatrogenic diseases are defined as illnesses due to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice.  Iatrogenic diseases are defined as illnesses due to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.  Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice.To study and evaluate major cardiac iatrogenic disease as the cause of admission to the intensive cardiac care unit in the modern era.We assessed 64 critically ill patients suffering from major cardiac iatrogenic problems among a total of 2,559 patients admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit during 3 years. Iatrogenic disease was defined as adverse drug reactions according to the World Health Organization Definition and complications induced by non-drug medical interventions. Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice. Iatrogenic illness was defined as any problem that resulted from therapy. An iatrogenic event was defined as "an adverse event related to a medical procedure". Patients with colorectal cancer who had splenectomy as a result of iatrogenic damage of the spleen while undergoing resection of the sigmoid or rectum for adenocarcinoma had a significantly worse prognosis. Intraoperative aortic dissection remains a rare and unpredictable complication of cardiac surgery, with worse outcomes than spontaneous aortic dissection. Increased age and atheromatous disease at the site of cannulation are significant risk factors for iatrogenic dissection. In this series, off-pump coronary artery bypass did not appear to be a risk factor for iatrogenic aortic dissection  Iatrogenic injury to the spleen is not an uncommon complication. Left nephrectomy has been reported as the second commonest cause of iatrogenic splenectomy with a reported incidence between 1.3 and 24%. Iatrogenic splenectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.AIMS: We reviewed the occurrence of iatrogenic splenectomy during left nephrectomy at our centre. Hallux valgus is a common forefoot pathology often requiring surgical intervention for symptomatic relief. One complication of hallux valgus correction is flexible hallux varus. Iatrogenic flexible hallux varus often requires surgical repair; however, the most advantageous surgical procedure for repair of iatrogenic flexible hallux varus and their sustainability remains unclear The possible interrelationship between such deposition and cranial irradiation and/or i.t. MTX suggests a new iatrogenic disorder.  report of a patient with granulomatous peritonitis following general surgery is presented. Laparoscopy was performed as the final diagnostic procedure. Prevention is the remedy for this iatrogenic problem. This report reviews both the medical and surgical literature during the past 15 years of patients treated for pseudomembranous colitis. Analysis of this clinical data has provided us with the opportunity to both define the role of surgery in this disorder and illustrate the necessity for a combined medical and surgical cooperative approach in the early management of this iatrogenic disease. Iatrogenic problems following gastric surgery. difficult to truly define iatrogenic complications in the postsurgical state in that the surgery is a condition originated by physician intervention and thus any problems that occur may be technically considered as physician created he most severe iatrogenic events were nosocomial infections (49/62 [79%]) and respiratory events (nine of 26 [35%]). Cutaneous injuries were frequent (n=94) but generally minor (89 [95%]), as were medication errors (15/19 [76%]). Most medication errors occurred during administration stage (12/19 [63%]) and were ten-fold errors (nine of 19 [47%]).

Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by weakness of the face, upper arm, shoulder, and lower limb musculature, with an onset between the first and third decades.  Clinical diagnosis is made from the distinctive pattern of weakness, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and confirmed by genetic testing.  In one family together with prenatal diagnosis founder mutation in FSHD A1 gene was detected, according to the autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance remarkable for its early involvement of facial musculature. Consensual diagnostic criteria for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) include onset of the disease in facial or shoulder girdle muscles, facial weakness in more than 50% of affected family members, autosomal dominant inheritance in familial cases, and evidence of myopathic disease in at least one affected member without biopsy features specific to alternative diagnoses Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant muscular disorder associated with a short (<35 kb) EcoRI/BlnI fragment resulting from deletion of an integral number of units of a 3.3-kb repeat located at 4q35. In 139 families, dominant inheritance was observed in 97, a pattern compatible with germline mosaicism in 6, while sporadic cases were found in 36 families.

5ace12be0340b9f058000007	Which gene is responsible for proper speech development?	The Key Regulator for Language and Speech Development, FOXP2, is a Novel Substrate for SUMOylation. Transcription factor forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) plays an essential role in the development of language and speech. Absence of a paternally inherited FOXP2 gene in developmental verbal dyspraxia. Mutations in FOXP2 cause developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), but only a few cases have been described. Our results indicate that absence of paternal FOXP2 is the cause of DVD in patients with SRS with maternal UPD7. The data also point to a role for differential parent-of-origin expression of FOXP2 in human speech development. Despite similarities in motor planning and execution between speech development and oral feeding competence, there have been no reports to date linking deletions within the FOXP2 gene to oral feeding impairments in the newborn. The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. The FOXP2 gene is important for the development of proper speech motor control in humans. BACKGROUND Mutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development. CNTNAP2 is known to be involved in the cause of language and speech disorders and autism spectrum disorder and is in the same pathway as FOXP2, another important language gene, which makes it a candidate gene for causal studies speech and language disorders such as stuttering. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language.	['FOXP2']
531a34d5b166e2b806000036	Which gene is required for the efficient function of clopidogrel?	The CYP2C19 G681A single polymorphism has been proven to affect clopidogrel responsiveness.  This study investigated the effect of coexisting polymorphisms of CYP2C19 and P2Y12 on clopidogrel responsiveness and adverse clinical events in Chinese patient ssociation of a functional polymorphism in the clopidogrel target receptor gene, P2Y12 We tested for an association of gene sequence variations in P2Y12 and occurrence of neurological adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) during clopidogrel treatment Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP] family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12) Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  The prodrug clopidogrel requires activation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes for its antiplatelet effect Carriers of the CYP2C19*2 and *4 alleles showed reduced platelet inhibition after a clopidogrel 600-mg loading dose but responded to higher loading and maintenance dose regimens Carriers of the CYP2C19*17 T-allele, with increased clopidogrel activation, had a 37% relative reduction in the TLR incidence, the primary end point The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel and poor clinical outcome after stent implantation From these results it is suggested that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with subclinical thrombus formation among Japanese patients receiving clopidogrel.  To determine the effect of various SNPs on post-clopidogrel platelet reactivity and clinical outcome. MATERIALS & METHODS: Cytochrome 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function (LOF; *2, *3) and gain-of-function (GOF; *17) allelic variants, together with ABCB1 (3435 CâT and 2677 GâT/A) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1; 192 QâR) SNPs were analyzed in 189 patients after elective stent implantation who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00638326) Chinese people are more frequent carriers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function alleles than Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 variants on clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in these patients The risk of a low response to clopidogrel and composite ischemic events increased with the number of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. However, there were not significant differences in clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes across the ABCB1 and PON1 genotype groups; bleeding was not significantly different across the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 genotype groups The CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles had a gene dose effect on the pharmacodynamics and composite ischemic events of clopidogrel in our study population. Neither the ABCB1 nor the PON1 genotype significantly influenced the antiplatelet effect and clinical outcomes of clopidogrel in these patients	['cytochrome P450, CYPC19']

Dasatinib inhibited antigen-specific proliferation of murine CD4(+) and CD8(+) transgenic T cells in vitro and in vivo Herein, we show that dasatinib inhibits TCR-mediated signal transduction, cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and in vivo T-cell responses.  Both dasatinib and staurosporine inhibited T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation in a dose-dependent manner.  Herein, we show that dasatinib inhibits TCR-mediated signal transduction, cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and in vivo T-cell responses Dasatinib, a small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation Dasatinib, a small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation. Dasatinib inhibits the proliferation and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. T-cell functions including proliferation, activation and cytokine production were all uniformly inhibited in the presence of dasatinib. We also demonstrated inhibition of TCR signalling through Src-family kinase LCK, and predicted that inhibition of LCK and other kinases involved in T-cell signalling by dasatinib is responsible for the suppression of T-cell function.

51716e808ed59a060a00000b	Which is the vector of Louping ill virus?	Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. n Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. The complex pathogen-host-vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector. We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system. This study has examined the efficacy following intramuscular administration of a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) vaccine, encoding the prME and NS1 proteins of louping ill virus (LIV), in sheep. Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered.

This event also causes phosphorylation of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein FANCI, triggering its monoubiquitination of the key DNA repair factor FANCD2 by the FA core E3 ligase complex, thereby promoting this central pathway of DNA repair which permits replication to be restarted. Here we show that the protein defective in individuals with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B is an essential component of the nuclear protein 'core complex' responsible for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key event in the DNA-damage response pathway associated with Fanconi anemia and BRCA. A key event in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein, which depends on a multiprotein FA core complex. The key event of the FA pathway is dependent on an eight-protein core complex (CC), required for the monoubiquitination of each member of the FANCD2-FANCI complex.

56c1f039ef6e394741000052	Which antibody is implicated in the Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis?	In addition, BBE and Fisher syndrome, which are clinically similar and are both associated with the presence of the immunoglobulin G anti-GQ1b antibody, represent a specific autoimmune disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms that include ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. The syndrome defined by Bickerstaff of progressive, external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, with disturbance of consciousness or hyperreflexia, has subsequently been associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies. An anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome has been proposed to underlie the common pathophysiology for the three disorders; however, other studies have found a positive anti-GM1 instead of anti-GQ1b antibody. Serologic analysis of antibodies against ganglioside complexes (anti-GDIa, anti-GDIb, anti-GM1, anti-GM2, anti-GM3, anti-GQIb and anti-GTIb antibodies) showed negative results. However, contrary to a proposed anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome, we would suggest that pathogenesis of this clinical spectrum is not limited to anti-ganglioside antibodies. Although there are usually no abnormalities in MFS by routine neuroimaging, in a few cases, contrast enhancement of nerve roots and signs of central nervous system involvement were described supporting the hypothesis of an anti-GQ1b-syndrome, a continuum involving GBS, MFS, and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis.  Anti-GM1 IgG, GD1a IgG, GQ1b IgG, and GT1a IgG antibodies were positive. The discovery of the association of the anti-GQ1b IgG antibody with the postinfectious clinical syndromes of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia helped house the phenotypes of the Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), atypical MFS, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome with ophthalmoplegia, and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis under one roof.  These findings suggest that host susceptibility may play a role in inducing the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies and the development of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. These antibodies should provide useful serological markers for identifying patients who have atypical GBS with preserved deep tendon reflexes, ataxic GBS, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis or acute ophthalmoparesis, especially for those who have no antibodies to GM1, GD1a or GQ1b.

Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome overlap in an asthma patient with negative anti-ganglioside antibodies. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis is a clinical syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and central nervous system signs and is associated with the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. This is only the second case in the literature of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies described in association with M pneumoniae infection. Of those patients with Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, ataxic GBS or acute ophthalmoparesis, 33% of 67 anti-GM1b-positive, and 52% of 25 anti-GalNAc-GD1a-positive patients had no anti-GQ1b antibodies. Fisher syndrome or Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis? Anti-GQ1b IgG antibody syndrome involving both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Anti-GQ1b antibody has been found in Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) with ophthalmoplegia, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE), and acute ophthalmoplegia without ataxia (AO). This case presented clinical characteristics of three syndromes concurrently-Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome-that may be collectively called 'anti-GQ1b IgG antibody syndrome'. This is the case of a 79-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome with features overlapping with the Miller Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and positive antiganglioside GQ1b antibody about 6 months after treatment with bendamustine and rituximab.

55149f156a8cde6b72000013	Which gene fusion is the result of the "philadelphia translocation" or the "philadelphia chromosome" mutation?	Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cytogenetic abnormality associated with poor outcome in adults. This preliminary study, in the absence of substantial evidence, reported the prevalence of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in ALL patients by RT-PCR in Pakistan. The Philadelphia chromosome and its corresponding fusion gene, BCR-ABL, is one of the best-known genetic abnormalities in hematological malignancies. Major BCR-ABL translocation is much more common in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minor BCR-ABL in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions.  The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation leading to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome resulting in BCR-ABL gene fusion is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the presence of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR/ABL gene fusion on the derivative chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.  Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transforming abilities. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic progenitors from some CML patients. The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. The translocation event creates on the Philadelphia chromosome a fusion between two genes: bcr and abl. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Using specific probes for the BCR and ABL genes, results of FISH showed a three-way variant Philadelphia translocation (9;22;21)(q34;q11;p12) with a BCR/ABL fusion residing on the der(22) and the 3BCR region translocated on the short arm of the derivative chromosome 21. We report a cytogenetic study of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who, while displaying a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting from a standard t(9;22) at diagnosis, during the chronic phase (CP) showed disappearance of the Ph and occurrence of new chromosome changes, including a marker probably arising from a translocation involving chromosome 17 and the Ph. In situ hybridization confirmed the cytogenetic appearance and demonstrated that the breakpoint on the Ph marker occurred below the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. BACKGROUND: The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. In the great majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome produces fusion DNA sequences consisting of the 5 part of the major breakpoint cluster region-1 (M-BCR-1) and the ABL protooncogene which encodes for the P210BCR-ABL phosphoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Unique fusion of bcr and c-abl genes in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Expression of the ABL-BCR fusion gene in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation	['The BCR/ABL gene fusion', 'ABL/BCR fusion']

An 8-year-old girl received 53 grays radiotherapy after surgery for craniopharyngioma. One year later she developed generalized dystonia Pharmacological treatment with tetrabenazine, clonazepam and trihexiphenydile allowed a very limited improvement of dystonia; welve cases of status dystonicus, of various underlying aetiologies, are presented Drug therapy with benzhexol, tetrabenazine and pimozide or haloperidol may be beneficial in some cases. Over the past 15 years we have treated 526 patients with severe hyperkinetic movement disorders with tetrabenazine (TBZ) The global response rating of 1 (marked improvement) was recorded in 89.2% of 93 patients with tardive stereotypy, 83.3% of 12 with myoclonus, 82.8% of 29 with Huntington's disease, 80.5% of 82 with tardive dystonia, 79.3% of 29 with other movement disorders, 62.9% of 108 with idiopathic dystonia Twelve adults with severe axial dystonia, and two children with life-threatening generalised dystonia were treated with a combination of a low constant dose of tetrabenazine to which were added pimozide and benzhexol as necessary. When benzhexol treatment alone fails in adults with severe disabling axial dystonia, or in children with life-threatening generalised dystonia, combined therapy with tetrabenazine, pimozide and benzhexol may give valuable symptomatic relief. We present 42 patients with tardive dystonia. The age of onset of dystonia was 13 to 60 years. The most frequently helpful medications were tetrabenazine (68% of patients improved) and anticholinergics (39% improved). 8-year-old boy of non-Jewish, Mexican-American descent with autosomal-dominant dystonia musculorum deformans who developed rapidly progressive and severe generalized dystonia, hyperpyrexia, myoglobinuria, and renal failure Transient improvement was achieved with tetrabenazine and baclofen	['up to > 60%']
5c960f21ecadf2e73f000020	What are DMARDs?	To determine the utility of ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  [DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs)]. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have largely contributed to recent paradigm shift of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategy. BACKGROUND Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are increasingly used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Tocilizumab (TCZ) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response (IR) to prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disorder of joints that is associated with high health care costs, yet guidance is lacking on how early to initiate biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a class of medications that is the major cost driver in RA management. BACKGROUND Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is typically characterized by the sequential use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). There are only six DMARDs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) available in the clinical practice, such as gold sodium thiomalate, D-penicillamine, bucillamine, auranofin, salazosulphapyridine, and lobenzarit disodium. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz(Â®)) is the first approved drug in a new class of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. OBJECTIVE Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard of care for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, studies have found that many patients do not receive them. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pharmacotherapy and should be initiated promptly after RA diagnosis. OBJECTIVES When rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have achieved sustained good clinical responses can their disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) be reduced or discontinued? BACKGROUND Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. BACKGROUND Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve outcomes compared to conventional therapy (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroids). Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of drugs which is used as medication in various arthritic conditions to arrest the progression of disease along with relief from pain. For this purpose, all patients with the diagnosis of RA should be treated by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including biologic DMARDs and non-biologic DMARDs. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Patients and rheumatologists have a number of options to consider for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). To explore what considerations patients have when deciding about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and what information patients need to participate in the decision-making process. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy is now clearly accepted as the primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, with an increasing emphasis on use of combination therapy. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? The efficacy of the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) shown in clinical trials may be jeopardized due to prevalent poor patient adherence. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism.

54e0d7471388e8454a000015	Which molecule is targeted by a monoclonal antibody Secukinumab?	We identified 3 distinct clonotypes that efficiently neutralized IL17A in a cell-based in vitro assay. Their potencies were comparable to those of known neutralizing antibodies, including 2, AIN457 (secukinumab) and ixekizumab that are currently in clinical development for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders.  Secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. BACKGROUND: Secukinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody. BACKGROUND: Secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis when administered via subcutaneous injection.  We evaluated secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  Ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody directed against the common p40 subunit of IL-23 and IL-12), secukinumab, ixekizumab (both monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-17A), and brodalumab a monoclonal antibody against the IL-17RA receptor) have been recently used in proof-of-concept and randomized trials in the ankylosing spondylitis and/or psoriatic arthritis subforms of SpA, with overall very promising clinical efficacy. The selective anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) attenuates IL17A-induced levels of IL6 in human astrocytes. The family of interleukin 17 receptors (IL17Rs), subtypes IL17RA-IL17RE, is targeted by the group of pro-inflammatory IL17 cytokines (IL17A-F) and moreover the newly developed anti-IL17A antibody secukinumab (AIN457) has shown promise in Phase II trials in multiple sclerosis.   Three agents neutralizing IL-17 (i.e., secukinumab and ixekizumab) or antagonizing its receptor (i.e., brodalumab) are currently being tested for efficacy and safety in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA. Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A whose efficacy in the therapy of chronic plaque psoriasis has been demonstrated in different phase II clinical trial.  Associations between IGA 0/1 responder rates and PASI scores were evaluated using data from two phase 2 studies with the anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) that utilized a similar 6-point IGA.  Several IL-17A inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-17RA monoclonal antibody brodalumab. Anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.  In a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A, was ineffective and associated with more adverse events than placebo. Several IL-17A blockers, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-IL-17 receptor subunit A monoclonal antibody brodalumab have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials.  Further studies are needed to clarify whether the therapeutic blockade of IL-17A through the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab is able to counteract the fibrogenic process in CD. Th-17A antagonism has been investigated by a randomized controlled trial in PsA patients with secukinumab, a fully human, high-affinity, monoclonal antibody in a cohort of patients with active PsA.  Efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriatic arthritis: a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II proof-of-concept trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human, anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody for targeted interleukin-17A blockade, in patients with noninfectious uveitis. Effect of IL-17A blockade with secukinumab in autoimmune diseases. Early clinical data are now available on secukinumab (AIN457), a recombinant, highly selective, fully human monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody of the IgG1/Îº isotype, enabling a preliminary assessment of the effects of IL-17A inhibition in multiple autoimmune diseases. In conjunction with studies using the humanised anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) ixekizumab (LY2439821) and the fully human anti-IL-17RA mAb brodalumab (AMG 827), the findings on secukinumab provide evidence for the role of IL-17A in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease and suggest the potential value of targeting this cytokine. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A IgG1Îº monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  Treatment with the interleukin-17A-blocking antibody secukinumab does not interfere with the efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects: results of an open-label, parallel-group, randomized single-center study. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects exposed to the anti-interleukin-17A (IL-17A) monoclonal antibody (MAb) secukinumab. Blockade of IL-17A by secukinumab does not appear to interfere with efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations, as assessed by the achievement of protective antibody levels. Secukinumab, a human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, for moderate to severe Crohn's disease: unexpected results of a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: The authors tested whether the anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab was safe and effective for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.  Secukinumab is an IL-17A monoclonal antibody that is under development and preliminary results have suggested its efficacy in inflammatory mediated diseases such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.

5a895f51fcd1d6a10c000004	What is the preferred orientation of CTCF binding sites for chromatin looping?	Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated Conversely, CTCF binding sites in NPCs are largely preexisting in pluripotent stem cells. Only a small number of CTCF sites arise de novo in NPCs.  Moreover, siRNA knockdown ofYy1specifically disrupts interactions between key NPC enhancers and their target genes. YY1-mediated interactions between NPC regulatory elements are often nested within constitutive loops anchored by CTCF As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another.  As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. ccctc binding factor ctcf is an architectural protein involved in the three dimensional 3d organization of chromatin in this study we assayed the 3d genomic contact profiles of a large number of ctcf binding sites with high resolution 4c seq as recently reported our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between ctcf binding sites oriented in a convergent manner to directly test this we used crispr cas9 genome editing to delete core ctcf binding sites in three loci including the ctcf site in the sox2 super enhancer in all instances ctcf and cohesin recruitment were lost and chromatin loops with distal convergent ctcf sites were disrupted or destabilized re insertion of oppositely oriented ctcf recognition sequences restored ctcf and cohesin recruitment but did not re establish chromatin loops we conclude that ctcf binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. we recently used in situ hi c to create kilobase resolution 3d maps of mammalian genomes here we combine these maps with new hi c microscopy and genome editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers domains and loops we find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer combining hi c data and novel mathematical theorems we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule instead we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding in one intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic tension globule in the other ccctc binding factor ctcf and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops however the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the ctcf binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation finally we perform 13 genome editing experiments examining the effect of altering ctcf binding sites on chromatin folding the convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case moreover the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3d maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of ctcf binding sites in the wt thus we show that it is possible to disrupt restore and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.

551c23bc6b348bb82c00000b	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the familial isolated pituitary adenoma?	The cause of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) remains unknown in a high percentage of cases, but the AIP gene plays an important role in the etiology.  Familial isolated pituitary adenoma caused by a Aip gene mutation not described before in a family context. We report a Spanish family with FIPA in whom a mutation in the AIP gene previously unreported in a familiar context was identified. FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families. Understanding the tumorigenic process in AIP-positive and AIP-negative FIPA patients could result in better diagnostic and treatment options for both familial and sporadic cases. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene has a major role in the pathogenesis of familial isolated pituitary adenoma.  The discovery of heterozygous, loss-of-function germline mutations in the gene encoding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) in 2006 has subsequently enabled the identification of a mutation in this gene in 20% of FIPA families and 20% of childhood-onset simplex soma- totroph adenomas.  This review aims to summarize currently available clinical data on AIP mutation-positive and negative FIPA patients. [Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene and familial isolated pituitary adenomas]. Many heterozygous mutations have been discovered in AIP in about 20% of FIPA families.  Germline mutations of aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor interacting protein (AIP) are associated with pituitary adenoma predisposition. They occur in 20Â % of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) and in about 3-5Â % of sporadic pituitary adenomas, especially in early onset somatotropinomas and prolactinomas.  We report a FIPA family harbouring an AIP R16H change, supporting the hypothesis that the latter represents a variant of unknown significance. Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds.  Genetic analysis in a patient presenting with meningioma and familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) reveals selective involvement of the R81X mutation of the AIP gene in the pathogenesis of the pituitary tumor. About 20 % of the families with FIPA harbor inactivating mutation in aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene (AIP) associated with loss of heterozygosity of the same genetic locus (11q13) in the tumor. Rarely different types of extra-pituitary tumors have been described in the setting of AIP mutation-positive FIPA.  Mutations in AIP account only for 15-25% of FIPA families.  In 20-40% of families with this syndrome, mutations have been identified in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene while in the rest of the families the causative gene or genes have not been identified.  Germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene (AIP) predispose to young-onset pituitary tumours, most often to GH- or prolactin-secreting adenomas, and most of these patients belong to familial isolated pituitary adenoma families. We also briefly describe the genetic basis of three other inherited states predisposing individuals to endocrine tumors, namely Carney's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism type 2 (HRPT2) and familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which are related to inactivating mutations in the PRKAR1-alpha, HRPT2 and AIP genes, respectively. The identification of mutations in the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) cases has recently expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited pituitary adenoma disorders. Several studies and reviews have assessed the genetic and clinical features of AIP-mutated FIPA patients, which range from a complete lack of symptoms in adult/elderly individuals to large, aggressive early-onset pituitary tumors. In 20% of FIPA families, heterozygous mutations have been described in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting (AIP) gene, whereas in other families the causative gene(s) are unknown. A novel C-terminal nonsense mutation, Q315X, of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene in a Japanese familial isolated pituitary adenoma family. Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) and the pituitary adenoma predisposition due to mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene. Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds. Mutations of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene are associated with pituitary adenomas that usually occur as familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA).

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) gene variants in AIP mutation-negative familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds. Although the cause of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) remains unknown in many cases, germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene were identified in approximately 20 % of families with FIPA The cause of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) remains unknown in a high percentage of cases, but the AIP gene plays an important role in the etiology FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds The identification of mutations in the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) cases has recently expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited pituitary adenoma disorders To date, the number of molecular genetic factors unequivocally linked to pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers of one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (2) the MENIN and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (3) mutations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% of familial isolated acromegaly	['aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein']

The hydrophobic major structural protein GvpA forms the ribbed gas vesicle wall.  The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC,  The wall of these gas vesicles is freely permeable to gas molecules and is composed of a small hydrophobic protein, GvpA, which forms a single-layer wall. Gas vesicles are intracellular, microbial flotation devices that consist of mainly one protein, GvpA. Modeling of the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA: from protein sequence to vesicle wall structure. Gas vesicle production and the expression of the gvpA gene encoding the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA, was monitored in each Haloferax volcanii transformant. Analysis of gas vesicle gene expression in Haloferax mediterranei reveals that GvpA and GvpC are both gas vesicle structural proteins.	['GvpA forms the gas vesicle wall']

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a distressing cause of infertility in young women. POI is heterogeneous with only a few causative genes having been discovered so far. Our objective was to determine the genetic cause of POI in a consanguineous Lebanese family with two affected sisters presenting with primary amenorrhoea and an absence of any pubertal development. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed. Whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband. Linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 7 where exome sequencing successfully identified a homozygous two base pair duplication (c.1947_48dupCT), leading to a truncated protein p.(Y650Sfs*22) in the STAG3 gene, confirming it as the cause of POI in this family. Exome sequencing combined with linkage analyses offers a powerful tool to efficiently find novel genetic causes of rare, heterogeneous disorders, even in small single families. This is only the second report of a STAG3 variant; the first STAG3 variant was recently described in a phenotypically similar family with extreme POI. Identification of an additional family highlights the importance of STAG3 in POI pathogenesis and suggests it should be evaluated in families affected with POI.

51387022bee46bd34c000002	Which is the process that Conserved noncoding elements mostly regulate?	Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development. Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes. These results suggest important roles for SINEs in the development of the mammalian neuronal network, a part of which was initiated with the exaptation of AmnSINE1 in a common mammalian ancestor. Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation. The majority of tetrapod-specific UCEs are noncoding and associated with genes involved in regulation of transcription and development. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs).

During this phase, at least 48 genes, collectively named Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, are important for the long-term survival of bacilli under a non-respiring state, a condition that bacilli encounter inside granulomatous lesions. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence.  DosR/DevR of M. tuberculosis is a two component dormancy survival response regulator which induces the expression of 48 genes.  The functional importance of tandem arrangement was established by analyzing promoter variants harboring Dev boxes with altered spacing. Conserved sequence logos were generated from 47 binding sequences which included 24 newly discovered Dev boxes.  The two component sensor/regulator dosRS is a major mediator in the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and controls a regulon of approximately 50 genes that are induced under this condition. In silico analysis of the DosR regulon in BCG and M. tuberculosis showed at least 97% amino acid sequence homology, with 41 out of 48 genes being identical.

5506ce078e1671127b00000b	Which protein phosphatase has been found to interact with the heat shock protein, HSP20?	 Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.  Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling.  Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20.

56d1f790f22319765a000001	Which gene harbors the mutation T790M?	Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20.  Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse.  Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M. However, resistance to the EGFR TKIs develops mostly secondary to T790M mutation in exon 20.  The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the threonine(790)-methionine(790) (T790M) point mutation of EGFR kinase is one of the leading causes of acquired resistance to the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib Both AKT and MEK inhibition contributed to cell death independent of erlotinib in the T790M-containing H1975 and the EGFR-WT cell lines tested.

5147c088d24251bc05000026	Which type of lung cancer is the most strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome?	The autoantibodies implicated in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES), which are known to inhibit ICa and INa in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, also significantly inhibited INa in SCLC cells. These results indicate that (i) action potentials in human SCLC cells result from the regenerative increase in voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance; (ii) fundamental characteristics of SCLC Na+ channels are the same as the classical sodium channels found in a variety of excitable cells; and (iii) in some LES patients, SCLC Na+ channels are an additional target of the pathological IgG present in the patients' sera. Clinical features were those of LES and occurred insidiously in this 68-year old man: proximal weakness predominant in the lower limbs, generalized areflexia, dryness of the mouth and partial right eye palsy. Investigations disclosed a small cell lung cancer. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may be important to the secretion of ectopic hormones and the etiology and pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of the motor nerve terminal in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are produced. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a myasthenia-like syndrome of paraneoplastic origin which is often associated with anaplastic small-cell lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common cause of LES. We report an unusual case of LES associated with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. The Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels and often occurs in patients with small cell lung cancer. A 53 year-old heavy smoker presented with a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Bronchoscopy was normal but radiological examinations revealed a lymph node in site 4R. The pathological diagnosis after mediastinoscopy was negative. Twenty-five months later, an opacity on chest X-ray led to a biopsy which revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. LEMS is generally associated with small cell lung cancer occurring in three percent of cases. However, the case that we report shows the unusual association of LEMS with non small-cell lung cancer and highlights the difficulties associated in the management of this condition. LEMS has a high degree of coincidence (approximately 60%) with small cell lung cancer; the remaining 40% of patients with LEMS have no detectable tumor. BACKGROUND: To enhance the acknowledgement of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer. There were 10 cases of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer Treatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome Improving the recognition of Lambert-Eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. The Lambert Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung cancer in 50% of the cases unlike generalized myasthenia which apparently is never associated with small-cell lung cancer. Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome is presented in two cases with small cell lung cancer. Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder caused by an IgG-mediated reduction in number of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the neuromuscular junction. In at least 50% of cases, the stimulus for antibody production may be VGCC on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Also, there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with LES from those with LES and concurrent SCLC. The cancer associated with LEMS was small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in 15 cases and epidermoid lung carcinoma in 3 cases. Etiology of this disease is uncertain but in view of its frequent association with small cell lung cancer, this specific type of neoplasm may be implicated in the initiation of autoimmune response. Recent studies indeed support the possibility that the antigenic stimulus in the neoplastic form of LES may arise from voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels found in the lung cancer cells. In the majority of LEMS patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells. Radiological, bronchoscopic and histological investigations revealed small-cell lung cancer, and neurophysiological investigations confirmed a diagnosis of LEMS. Physicians need to be aware that patients may develop PCD and LEMS associated with anti-VGCC antibody caused by small cell lung cancer, and a mass survey should be conducted and careful examinations performed. Biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) indicating the importance of repeated chest CT in LEMS even when an existing autoimmune-like disease and negative CT may suggest an autoimmune origin. BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular symptoms in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop more rapidly than in LEMS patients without a SCLC. The detection of SOX1 antibodies in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) predicts the presence of small cell lung cancer and may be used to follow more closely those LEMS patients with no evidence of cancer at the initial workup. The presence of a particular symptom associated with LEMS did not predict the presence of SCLC, but in patients with rapidly progressive LEMS the possibility of underlying lung cancer should be of particular concern. We report a case of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with LEMS and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week. Using this protein, we demonstrated that anti-beta-subunit antibodies are present in the sera of 23% of LEMS patients and only, in low titer, in 2% of small cell lung cancer patients without LEMS. The gene encoding the beta 2 protein, first described as a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) antigen in humans, is found close to a region that undergoes chromosome rearrangements in small cell lung cancer, which occurs in association with LEMS. We then tested sera from 72 LEMS patients' 25 with proven small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 66 healthy or other neurological, SCLC or autoimmune disease controls in an immunoprecipitation assay using 125I-omega-CmTx-labelled (P/Q-type) VGCCs in human cerebellar extract. In the majority of patients LEMS is associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in particular may develop LEMS, and SCLC is very often detected in patients affected by LEMS. We present a 69-year-old woman who had preventive whole brain radiation after a diagnosis of paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome related to small cell lung cancer Five months after radiation therapy, she developed radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy manifested by ataxia. Among the symptoms of lung cancer LEMS can be seen, but it is very rare. A patient with the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) and small cell lung cancer developed respiratory failure several hours after verapamil was given.	['small-cell lung cancer']

5a43a139966455904c000008	What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?	Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS).  Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. Genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation within individual DNA molecules. Importantly, NOMe-seq obtains DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same DNA molecule, giving the first genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq).  Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession GSE57498. The NOMe-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Finally, these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively. Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. We develop a statistical method, epiG, to infer and differentiate between different epi-allelic haplotypes, annotated with CpG methylation status and DNA polymorphisms, from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and nucleosome occupancy from NOMe-seq data. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq).

5173bdb38ed59a060a000020	How many TAp73 isoforms have been identified in humans?	A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ÎN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ÎNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. Transcription from two different promoters on the p73 gene results in generation of transcriptionally active TAp73 isoforms and dominant negative DeltaNp73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type. The role of various p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis has been controversial. However, as we have recently shown, the generation of TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mice reveals that TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp-73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p73 isoforms, TAp73(-/-) mice show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors. Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (deltaN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionaly active TAp73, as well as a dominant-negatively acting DeltaNp73 transcript isoforms. Since some mutant p53 proteins and ÎNp73 isoforms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentially act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ÎN isoforms. p73 is expressed as TA and ÎN isoforms, both of which are implicated in tumor suppression and/or promotion. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. p73 possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter controlling the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 isoforms and the anti-apoptotic ÎÎp73 isoforms respectively. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of two N-terminal isoforms, TAp73 and ÎNp73, in medulloblastoma cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, to lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ÎN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. The p73 gene possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter, resulting in TAp73 and DeltaNup73 isoforms, respectively. Mice with a complete deficiency of p73 have severe neurological and immunological defects due to the absence of all TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. Moreover, we also found that subcellular location of p73 isoforms changes with the culture density increases. Moreover, ectopic expression of DeltaNp73alpha (but not other p73 isoforms) increased alphaB-crystallin mRNA levels in the absence of p53. Like wt p53, TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms transactivate target genes that activate apoptosis signaling pathways. The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. In contrast, antiapoptotic DeltaNp73 isoforms lack the TA domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. The isoforms TAp63 and TAp73 transactivate p53 target genes and induce apoptosis, whereas the isoforms DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73 lack transactivation and might have dominant-negative effects in p53 family members. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated in tumors. Consequently, different p73 isoforms can be degraded by calpains, i.e., both N-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and DeltaNp73) as well as the C-terminal isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Variants lacking the TA domain (DeltaN isoforms) are induced by TAp73 and by p53, and inhibit their transcriptional activity. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). Interestingly, expression of the Delta Np73 is strongly up-regulated by the TA isoforms and by p53, thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of TAp73 and more importantly of p53.

Collagen was extracted from modern and archaeological cod bones using a weak HCl solution and analysed for its sulphur isotopic composition by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) With the high sensitivity of current generation mass spectrometers, ZooMS provides a non-destructive and highly cost-effective method to characterise collagen peptides. Archaeological bones are usually dated by radiocarbon measurement of extracted collagen.  we describe three complementary preparative HPLC procedures suitable for separating and isolating single amino acids from bone collagen or hair keratin with minimal isotopic contamination.  Bulk bone collagen isotopic analysis of 11 skeletons of Iron Age and Roman date gave a typical C(3) terrestrial signal ( Comparison of liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS) and gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) for the determination of collagen amino acid Î´13C values for palaeodietary and palaeoecological reconstruction. Although the primary focus was the compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen AAs, because of its growing application for palaeodietary and palaeoecological reconstruction, the results are relevant to any field where AA Î´(13)C values are required.  In archaeological studies, the isotopic enrichment values of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen give a degree of information on dietary composition.  Liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurement of Î´13C of amino acids in plant proteins. A new procedure for extraction of collagen from modern and archaeological bones for 14C dating. Bones are potentially the best age indicators in a stratigraphic study, because they are closely related to the layer in which they are found. Collagen is the most suitable fraction and is the material normally used in radiocarbon dating.

Species identification by analysis of bone collagen using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Analysis of the collagen from 32 different mammal species identified a total of 92 peptide markers that could be used for species identification, for example, in processed food and animal feed.

Stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) isotope ratios were measured in bone collagen and dentine from human skeletons excavated from this site in order to establish a weaning curve in mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers. Mass spectrometric analysis of the stable carbon isotope composition (13C/12C or delta 13C) of bone collagen from human remains recovered at archaeological sites provides a direct chemical method for investigating dietary patterns of prehistoric human populations. Coupled with more traditional archaeological methods, stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen can significantly enhance reconstruction of dietary patterns of prehistoric humans.	['Collagen']

571f5e740fd6f91b6800000b	Which enzyme is deficient in Gaucher's disease?	Gaucher's disease is caused by deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity Gaucher's disease is due to glucocerebrosidase deficiency which is responsible for the accumulation of non degraded glucosylceramide within the lysosomes of macrophages: these "Gaucher cells", overloaded and alternatively activated, release in patient's plasma numerous compounds (cytokines, chemokines, hydrolases...) some of which contribute to the various tissue damages Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase Gaucher disease is an inborn recessive autosomal disease due to a partial deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. The deficient activity leads to accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside in the liver, the spleen and bone marrow with concomitant anemia and thrombocytopenia Alglucerase is a modified form of human placental glucocerebrosidase used as enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher's disease, in whom functional glucocerebrosidase is deficient The common mutations found in the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, beta-glucocerebrosidase, earmark these proteins for destruction by the endoplasmic reticulum-localised protein folding machinery, resulting in enzyme insufficiency, lysosomal glycolipid storage and subsequent pathology. Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls. It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). The gene for glucocerebrosidase ( GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, is located in a gene-rich region on 1q21. Î²-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, also has an essential role in maintaining epidermal permeability function, by regulating the ratio of ceramides to glucosylceramides in the stratum corneum of the skin. Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are also identified at an increased frequency among Parkinson probands, including those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Structure/function relationships of acid beta-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, were evaluated by characterizing the proteins expressed from cDNAs encoding normal and mutant enzymes. Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA, E.C.3.2.1.45) GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD) LIMP-2 is required for the normal biogenesis and maintenance of lysosomes and endosomes and has been identified as the specific receptor for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are a common genetic risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease and related disorders, implicating the role of this lysosomal hydrolase in the disease etiology This gene is involved in lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate-independent trafficking of Î²-glucocerebrosidase (GC), an enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls The common mutations found in the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, beta-glucocerebrosidase, earmark these proteins for destruction by the endoplasmic reticulum-localised protein folding machinery, resulting in enzyme insufficiency, lysosomal glycolipid storage and subsequent pathology Replacement therapy for inherited enzyme deficiency--macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase for Gaucher's disease. Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher's disease, the most prevalent of the sphingolipid storage disorders, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase). Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the enzyme deficient in Gaucher's disease (GD) are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. Gaucher's disease is caused by deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity. Functional glucocerebrosidase is deficient in Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that affects people of all ethnic backgrounds, but has a higher incidence among East European Jews (Ashkenazim). We studied two patients with type IV glycogen storage disease 37 and 91 months after liver transplantation and a third patient with lysosomal glucocerebrosidase deficiency (type 1 Gaucher's disease), in whom tissue glucocerebroside deposition had decreased 26 months after liver replacement, to determine whether the migration of cells from the allograft (microchimerism) could explain the improved metabolism of enzyme-deficient tissues in the recipient.

54fc91e96ad7dcbc12000001	PBT2 has been tested for which disorder?	PBT2 improved cognition in a phase II clinical trial with AD patients, and further clinical testing is currently underway. In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.  The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia.  The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight the emerging notion that metal chaperones, such as PBT2 (Prana Biotechnology), modulate a variety of critical pathways affecting key aspects of the AD cascade to provide a more "holistic" approach to the treatment of this disease. The Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2 promotes amyloid-Î² degradation and GSK3 phosphorylation via a metal chaperone activity. The leading compound in this class of therapeutic, PBT2, improved cognition in a clinical trial with AD patients.  Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD. Metalloproteinase modifiers such as PBT2 may be useful AD therapies, but current evidence gives no support to their immediate use in pre-symptomatic AD. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials.  PBT2 rapidly improves cognition in Alzheimer's Disease: additional phase II analyses.  A recent Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta42, and significantly improved executive function on a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within 12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD.  These findings further encourage larger-scale testing of PBT2 for AD. Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Experimental treatments potentially useful for Alzheimer's disease include dimebon, PBT2 and etanercept; the safety and efficacy of the Alzheimer's vaccine remains to be proven, and growth hormone secretagogue and tarenflurbil are likely ineffective.  The recent report of positive results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of PBT2, a novel drug that targets amyloid-beta-metal interactions, underscores the value of abnormal transition metal metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. It has performed very satisfactorily in toxicology and Phase I clinical trials and is advancing as a disease-modifying candidate drug for Alzheimer's disease. Future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness. Small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions (e.g., PBT2) are currently advancing through clinical trials and show increasing promise as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease based on the "metal hypothesis." Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD.	["Alzheimer's disease"]
530cefaaad0bf1360c00000d	Which hormone abnormalities are common in Williams syndrome ?	WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. The cortisol awakening response in WS was associated with parent-reported levels of somatic complaints and social difficulties. Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile that may be sensitive to social and activity transitions throughout the day. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior.  Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects.  Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized by cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended.  In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation.  Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.  None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism.  Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well.  Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). A WS patient with CPP is presented, whose pubertal development and bone age progression were arrested by administration of GnRH analogues.   This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy.  In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height. Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent.  Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS.  Thyroid hemiagenesis and elevated thyrotropin levels in a child with Williams syndrome. A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. However, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and thyroid dysgenesis have been found in other WS cases.  We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.  Although growth hormone deficiency is not likely to be a common cause of short stature in Williams-Beuren syndrome, we nevertheless recommend evaluation of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis in all cases. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.  Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels.  These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion. It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome.   These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion, compared with a group of seven normal children. Our studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome. Additional periodic evaluations during childhood: serum concentration of calcium, thyroid function, hearing, and renal and bladder ultrasound examination. Periodic evaluations during adulthood: glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, and arterial stenosis; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function.  Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%).	['thyroid']

5c74266a7c78d694710000a2	Which biological process takes place in nuclear speckles?	Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles  In a previous study (MelcÃ¡k et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mRNA takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of RNA into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of RNA into the speckles.  Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.   Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity. Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity. DNAJC17 is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with splicing machinery components. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells.

58917c88621ea6ff7e00000a	Where can you find the annulus of Zinn?	Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The annular tendon is commonly named 'annulus of Zinn', from the German anatomist and botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759) who described this structure in his Descriptio anatomica oculi humani (Anatomical Description of the Human Eye, 1755). It arose at the annulus of Zinn, passing forwards between the inferior rectus muscle and lateral rectus muscle, and insert directly on the sclera.  Drilling was continued toward the annulus of Zinn (AZ) and optic nerve superiorly and over the intracavernous ICA posteriorly. Measurements before and after resection of the ACP included the length of C6 segment of the ICA on its lateral aspect; C6 segment length on its medial aspect; and medial length of the optic nerve from the optic chiasm to falciform ligament (before ACP resection) then to the annulus of Zinn (after ACP resection). The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle.   In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1.5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles.  The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. PURPOSE: To describe a combined transcranial-orbital approach for en bloc resection of optic nerve gliomas with preservation of the annulus of Zinn that minimizes recurrence and prevents postoperative paralytic ptosis.DESIGN: A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.STUDY POPULATION: All patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resections using this technique with the authors between 1994 and 2010.PROCEDURE: A transcranial-orbital approach is used to resect the intracranial segment of the optic nerve glioma from 2 mm anterior to the chiasm to the posterior extent of annulus of Zinn. No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis.CONCLUSIONS: The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis.

The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle. The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes.The findings for our patients, particularly in those who underwent additional high resolution MRI, did not provide evidence of a lack of CN IV as a cause of Brown syndrome. Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes. The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. Through a superior orbitotomy exposure, the entire retrobulbar segment of the tumor is transected from the globe to the annulus of Zinn.	['orbit', 'EYE']

54f9cb34dd3fc62544000002	Which protein has been found to interact with phospholamban (PLN) and is also an anti-apoptotic protein?	To identify additional proteins that may interact with PLN, we used the yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cDNA library. HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner. Analysis of the anti-apoptotic function of HAX-1 revealed that the presence of PLN enhanced the HAX-1 protective effects from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. These findings suggest a possible link between the Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the PLN/HAX-1 interaction. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms through which SERCA2a and PLN control cardiomyocyte function in health and disease. Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores. Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function. The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death. Here we identify HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade.  Furthermore, the effects of PLN and its phosphorylation on cardiac function are subject to additional regulation by its interacting partners, the anti-apoptotic HAX-1 protein and Gm or the anchoring unit of protein phosphatase 1.  Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2.

55032e65e9bde69634000034	What is the characteristic feature of the Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome.	Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a rare condition characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, calvarial thickening, skull and facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiparesis, cognitive impairment and seizures. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome refers to atrophy of one cerebral hemisphere (hemiatrophy) due to an insult to the brain in fetal or early childhood period.  Acquired cerebral hemiatrophy: Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome - a case report. CT and MRI scan of the head showed hemiatrophic cerebral parenchyma with prominent sulci and encephalomalacia. CT of the brain revealed characteristic features diagnostic of infantile type of cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed atrophic of left cerebral hemisphere with mildly ventricular dilatation, prominent paranasal and mastoid air cells, suggestive of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS). Imaging showed resolution of the infection and features of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (cerebral hemiatrophy).  Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare epilepsy syndrome that is characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, homolateral skull hyperplasia, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses, seizures with or without mental retardation, and contralateral hemiparesis.  Brain MRI showed prominent atrophy in the left frontal dorsal and lateral regions and mild atrophy of the left superior temporal gyrus and left parietal gyri. A 15-year-old female presented with seizures, right-sided hemiparesis, hemiatrophy of the right side of the body and mental retardation.  Described here is the case of a girl with a reticulated capillary malformation on the right side of her face, along with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, as evidenced by microphthalmia and severe associated anomalies in the right eye, and right cerebral hemispheric atrophy and cerebral arteries malformations. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the cognitive and electroclinical characteristics of right cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome [DDMS]).  The CHA of childhood or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, is originated by intrauterine or perinatal insults that affect the perfusion of a single cerebral hemisphere, manifesting clinically by variable mental retardation, refractory epilepsy, facial asymmetry, hemiplegia/hemiparesis or abnormal movements of the contralateral extremities and by imaging studies, loss of volume in one cerebral hemisphere and ipsilateral compensatory cranial changes such as skull vault thickening, elevation of the orbital roof and petreous ridge, also hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinus and mastoid cells. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a disorder involving hemiatrophy or hypoplasia of 1 cerebral hemisphere secondary to an insult in the developing brain. Often this will manifest with seizures, hemiparesis, mental retardation, and facial changes. Associated with this pathology are the radiologically evident changes, such as thickening of the calvarium, hyperpneumatization of the sinuses, and dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle among others. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, or cerebral hemiatrophy, is a pre- or perinatally acquired entity characterized by predominantly neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia, and mental retardation.  The Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is characterized by various symptoms related to hemiatrophy of the cerebrum and hypertrophy of the ipsilateral calvarium and paranasal sinuses. Clinical findings include hemiparesis or hemiplegia, seizures and/or mental retardation.  Asymmetry of cerebral hemispheric growth with atrophy on one side, ipsilateral osseous hypertrophy and hyper-pneumatization of sinuses with contralateral paresis are features of Dyke Davidoff Masson Syndrome (DDMS).  Dyke Davidoff Masson syndrome (DDMS) is characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia and mental retardation. The characteristic radiologic features are cerebral hemiatrophy with homolateral hypertrophy of the skull and sinuses. We report a case of DDMS in an 18-month-old girl who presented with right sided focal seizures, hemiparesis of the same side, and delayed milestones. Cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome) in childhood: clinicoradiological analysis of 19 cases. The so-called Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare disorder of cerebral hemiatrophy. The clinical presentation may consist of facial asymmetry, contralateral atrophy (including the trunk, and the extremities) and hemiparesis, speech difficulties, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is clinically characterized by hemiparesis, hemiplegia, seizures, mental retardation, and facial asymmetry secondary to congenital or early childhood vascular insult. A 21-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presented with uncontrolled seizures. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis and mental retardation. Brain MRI showed unilateral loss of cerebral volume with hypertrophy and hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells.  Although radiological findings of cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome) are well known, there is no systematic study about the gender and the affected side in this syndrome. The patient was a 19-year-old woman who presented with hemiatrophy and diminished superficial sensation on the left side of her body including her face. She had a past history of tonic-clonic seizures accompanied by left hemiparesis in late childhood. Brain CT demonstrated dilatation of the frontal sinus, calvarial thickening, cerebral hemiatrophy and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on the right side. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the right cerebrum and midbrain and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on T1-weighted images, as well as a high signal intensity area from the parietal to the occipital lobe on T2-weighted images.  Cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis, and mental retardation.  The radiological features are unilateral loss of cerebral volume and associated compensatory bone alterations in the calvarium, like thickening, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells and elevation of the petrous ridge.  We reported a 39-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presenting with total hemiatrophy.  This paper presents an 18-year-old mentally retarded patient with cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome) associated with a growing skull fracture in the ipsilateral hemicranium, in whom not only a dural tear but also the ipsilaterally displaced and dilated lateral ventricle due to the original disease apparently contributed to the development of growing skull fracture. The magnetic resonance (MR) findings of three patients with cerebral hemiatrophy, the so-called Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, which is characterized by variable degrees of unilateral loss of cerebral volume and compensatory changes of the calvarium are presented. MRI brain revealed characteristic features diagnostic of congenital type of cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Imaging showed resolution of the infection and features of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (cerebral hemiatrophy).

553ca8d8f32186855800000d	What is the effect of the absence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rrm3p?	Twice as many pause sites were identified in rrm3 compared with wild-type cells, as pausing in this strain occurred at both highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and the previously identified protein DNA complexes. ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are a class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cells The DNA helicase Rrm3 promotes replication fork progression through >1000 discrete genomic regions and represses the cDNA-mediated mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon. We explored the connection between DNA replication and Ty1 retromobility by investigating the basis of increased retromobility in an rrm3 mutant. Even though Ty1 cDNA levels are increased in the absence of RRM3, neither the level nor target-site specificity of cDNA integration was altered We propose that RNA:DNA hybrid regions within nascent retrotransposition events block replication in an rrm3 mutant, leading to chromosome breaks within Ty1 sequences We demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3  However, the essential nuclear function of Pfh1p could be supplied by Rrm3p. Expression of Rrm3p suppressed the accumulation of DNA damage foci but not the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cells depleted of nuclear Pfh1p. Together, these data demonstrate that Pfh1p has essential roles in the replication of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA  In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activities Rrm3p is a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase that helps replication forks traverse protein-DNA complexes. Its absence leads to increased fork stalling and breakage at over 1,000 specific sites located throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome These data suggest a model in which the stalled and broken forks generated in rrm3 cells activate a checkpoint response that provides time for fork repair and restart Lack of the yeast Rrm3p DNA helicase causes replication defects at multiple sites within ribosomal DNA (rDNA), including at the replication fork barrier (RFB) The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RRM3 gene encodes a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. While replication of most of the yeast genome was not dependent upon Rrm3p, in its absence, replication forks paused and often broke at an estimated 1400 discrete sites, including tRNA genes, centromeres, inactive replication origins, and transcriptional silencers. These replication defects were associated with activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint. Activation of the checkpoint was critical for viability of rrm3Delta cells, especially at low temperatures These data indicate that the Rrm3p DNA helicase helps replication forks traverse protein-DNA complexes, naturally occurring impediments that are encountered in each S phase In wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, replication forks slowed during their passage through telomeric C(1-3)A/TG(1-3) tracts. This slowing was greatly exacerbated in the absence of RRM3, shown here to encode a 5' to 3' DNA helicase  Loss of Rrm3p also resulted in replication fork pausing at specific sites in subtelomeric DNA, such as at inactive replication origins, and at internal tracts of C(1-3)A/TG(1-3) DNA Local chromatin structure at the ribosomal DNA causes replication fork pausing and genome instability in the absence of the S. cerevisiae DNA helicase Rrm3p.

5ac3699f0340b9f058000001	Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?	 Recent comparative studies have begun to investigate the evolution of the sequence architecture within enhancers. A detailed analysis of the fast-evolving sparkling enhancer in Drosophila now identifies key compensatory mechanisms and 'grammar' elements that are critical for maintaining functional integrity. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located We summarize recent case studies and genome-wide investigations that have uncovered diverse mechanisms though which new enhancers arise We report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes.  Our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences.

56d1e23c67f0cb3d66000009	Which are the coactivators of the Yes-associated protein (yap)?	ndependent research, often in the context of muscle biology, described Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors, which bind CATTCC DNA motifs to regulate gene expression. These two research areas were joined by the finding that the Hippo pathway regulates the activity of Tead transcription factors mainly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivators Yap and Taz, which bind to and activate Teads. TEADs on their own are unable to activate transcription and they require the help of coactivators. Several TEAD-interacting coactivators are known and they can be classified into three groups: (1) YAP and its paralog TAZ; YAP and TAZ are transcription coactivators and effectors of the Hippo pathway, which play a key role in organ size control. Through interaction with transcription factors such as TEADs, they activate gene transcription and thus promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate cell differentiation.  The YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex also upregulates several other proliferation-promoting genes and also promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation. hree-dimensional structure of the YAP-TEAD complex	['Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors.']

517194ef8ed59a060a000011	Which is the causative agent of malaria?	lasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. < Overcoming antigenic variation is one of the major challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of human malaria. [The vivax malaria causative agent Plasmodium ovale: the present global area, intraspecies polymorphism, importation to the Russian Federation (1992-2011)]. The global area for Plasmodium ovale is small as compared with that for other species of human malaria pathogens. Parasites that have been described to affect the central nervous system (CNS), either as the dominant or as a collateral feature, include cestodes (Taenia solium (neurocysticerciasis), Echinococcus granulosus (cerebral cystic echinococcosis), E. multilocularis (cerebral alveolar echinococcosis), Spirometra mansoni (neurosparganosis)), nematodes (Toxocara canis and T. cati (neurotoxocariasis), Trichinella spiralis (neurotrichinelliasis), Angiostrongylus cantonensis and A. costaricensis (neuroangiostrongyliasis), Gnathostoma spinigerum (gnathostomiasis)), trematodes (Schistosoma mansoni (cerebral bilharziosis), Paragonimus westermani (neuroparagonimiasis)), or protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii (neurotoxoplasmosis), Acanthamoeba spp. or Balamuthia mandrillaris (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis), Naegleria (primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis), Entamoeba histolytica (brain abscess), Plasmodium falciparum (cerebral malaria), Trypanosoma brucei gambiense/rhodesiense (sleeping sickness) or Trypanosoma cruzi (cerebral Chagas disease)) Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a deadly infectious disease for which treatments are scarce and drug-resistant parasites are now increasingly found. In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages. Whereas no biological activity was previously identified for 1, the material derived from the efficient synthesis enabled additional bioactivity tests leading to the identification of a notable activity against insect cells and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, encodes an SSB protein that localizes to the apicoplast and likely functions in the replication and maintenance of its genome. While observing cells by time-lapse imaging is a standard procedure in many systems, this technique was until recently not available for blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, possesses three translationally active compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondrion and a relic plastid called the apicoplast. The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate. The genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a tandemly repeated, linear element of 6 kb. The culminating step of the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is the spectacular release of multiple invasive merozoites on rupture of the infected erythrocyte membrane. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria, is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. The Hsp90 protein from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is critical for this organism's survival; the anti-Hsp90 drug geldanamycin is toxic to P. falciparum growth. A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria. The Plasmodium parasite, causative agent of malaria, infects RBC that are phagocytosed by DC and macrophages during the course of infection. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease where new drug targets are required due to increasing resistance to current anti-malarials. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, invades host erythrocytes using several proteins on the surface of the invasive merozoite, which have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates. Few studies have investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for what seems to be a possible interaction between Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, and HIV-1 in dually infected patients. We show that orthochromatic cells are the earliest stages that may be invaded by Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal human malaria. Infection by Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is associated with hemolysis and therefore with release of hemoglobin from RBC. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases Plasmodium falciparum, the most important causative agent of human malaria, undergoes antigenic variation as a means of prolonging infection and ensuring transmission between hosts. L-Malate dehydrogenase (PfMDH) from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for the most severe form of malaria, has shown remarkable similarities to L: -lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). FQ is able to overcome the chloroquine (CQ) resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum posses a single aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which represents a potential drug target for treatment of the disease. An essential requisite for transmission of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is the successful completion of a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) has been implicated in pathogenesis through its role in var gene silencing. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, is totally dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the fatal form of malaria, synthesizes GMP primarily from IMP and, hence, needs active GMPS (GMP synthetase) for its survival. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most serious form of malaria, infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year. Plasmodium vivax is an important human pathogen causing malaria in more temperate climates of the world. Similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for malaria tropica, drug resistance is beginning to emerge for this parasite species and this hampers adequate treatment of infection. Malaria kills more than one million people a year, and understanding the historical association between its most notorious causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, and its mosquito vectors is important in fighting the disease. We show here that macrophages are mandatory for NK cell IFN-gamma secretion in response to erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), a causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe and mortal type of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the main causative agent of tropical malaria, the most severe parasitic disease in the world. Growing resistance of Plasmodia towards available drugs is an increasing problem in countries where malaria is endemic. The presence of antisense RNA in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, remains controversial. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore the family of antioxidant enzymes, peroxiredoxins (Prxs) represent a target for antimalarial drug design. In the Republic of Yemen, Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant causative agent of malaria and is associated with adverse consequences for pregnant women and their babies. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions to invade host red blood cells (RBCs). Comparative genomic analysis of the malaria causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, with other eukaryotes for which the complete genome is available, revealed that the genome from P. falciparum was more similar to the genome of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, than to other non-apicomplexan taxa. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, totally depends on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies extensively on glycolysis coupled with homolactic fermentation during its blood-borne stages for energy production. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes. Seven sPLA(2)s from groups IA, IB, IIA and III, were tested here in different culture conditions for inhibition of the in vitro intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, relies on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. In spite of research efforts to develop vaccines against the causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, effective control remains elusive. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to undergo sexual differentiation and development in anopheline mosquitoes for transmission to occur. For Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of tropical malaria, TrxR is an essential protein which has been validated as a drug target. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must first infect hepatocytes to initiate a mammalian infection. Cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs) have become attractive drug targets in an effort to identify effective inhibitors of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. It is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong CD8(+) T cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, Plasmodium spp. A novel method for the in vitro detection of the protozoan Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has been developed. Trypanosomes do not inhabit or grow in anopheles mosquitoes, the vector for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites the causative agent for malaria. The genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, rapidly approaches completion, but our ability to genetically manipulate this organism remains limited. It is caused by a number of species of the genus Plasmodium, and Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form. To complete its life cycle in the mosquito, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to traverse the epithelia of the midgut and salivary glands. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, the catalytic subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Pfpka-c) exists as a single copy. Sulfadoxine is the most extensively used drug of this group of drugs and is usually combined with pyrimethamine (Fansidar), particularly for the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria. Resistance to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination is widespread. A putative glutathione peroxidase gene (Swiss-Prot accession number Z 68200) of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is an asexual blood-stage protein expressed in the invasive merozoite form of Plasmodia species, which are the causative agent of malaria. In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, this approach is especially interesting, because here both key enzymes, ODC and AdoMetDC, are combined in a bifunctional protein, ODC/AdoMetDC. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. A laboratory model of circulation of the malaria causative agent P. gallinaceum has been used to show that the effect of precocene (antijuvenoid) leads to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infected females developing eggs after blood suction. A cell-free incubation system prepared from asexual erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans, is capable of synthesizing the same spectrum of GPIs as that found in metabolically labelled parasites. The Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite is the causative agent of malaria tropica. The gene of an NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was cloned from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria. This study describes the synergistic interaction of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil (VR) and SR33557 or fantofarone (SR), in reversing chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria, a disease of worldwide importance. Two enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the intraerythrocytic malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum: glutathione disulfide reductase, an antioxidative enzyme, which appears to play an essential role for parasite growth and differentiation, and glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme not occurring in the host erythrocyte. The paper provides evidence that the An. sacharovi females which do not develop mature eggs after blood-sucking on the malaria-infected donor could not be infected by the bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man. Plastid origin of an extrachromosomal DNA molecule from Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. [New models of the circulation of the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium gallinaceum using malarial mosquitoes in the fauna of the USSR]. [Experimental research on the effect of biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria. 3. Algae, fertilizers]. On a model pair Aedes aegypti--Plasmodium gallinaceum in has been shown that changes in the conditions of larvae development caused by the addition into the water medium of the live culture of Synochocystis sp. cyanobacteria or green seaweeds Chlorella vulgaris, acetone extracts from the live culture precipitate or Chlorella powder, as well as nitrogen-containing fertilizer--ammonium chloride did not lower the sensitivity of the imago flying to malaria parasites. The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein. The feasibility was determined of influencing Ae. aegypti sensitivity to bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum by sublethal concentrations of herbicides (ordram and propanide) and fungicides (fundozol and blue vitriol) introduced into the larvae habitation medium or into the imago feed. [An experimental study of the effect of different biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria. 1. Insect development regulators]. It has been shown on the model pair Ae. aegypti-P. gallinaceum that dimilin, an inhibitor of insect chitin synthesis has practically no effect on female sensitivity to malaria agent. [The absence of an action of the pyrethroids deltamethrin and cypermethrin on mosquito susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria]. Mosquitos Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi contact with sublethal doses of deltametrin and cypermetrin pyretroids at larval stage and in grown state, when diet includes sugar with pyretroids, had no influence on the sensitivity of survived females to malaria agents P. gallinaceum and P. berghei. This prompted us to purify and characterize the topoisomerases I and II present in the erythrocytes of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, in order to later use these enzymatic systems in antimalarial drug assays. The problem of drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria and its role in the general system of malaria control are discussed. [Effect of mosquito contact with DDT and their susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria]. [Lack of an effect from repeated blood sucking by mosquitoes on their infectivity with the causative agent of malaria]. The lack of repeated bloodsucking does not affect essentially the infection of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with malaria agent, P. gallinaceum. High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria. BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. The effectiveness of methylene blue (MB) combined with pyrimethamine (PYR), chloroquine (CQ) or quinine (Q) was examined in a classical four-day suppressive test against a causative agent of rodent malaria, Plasmodium berghei. Infection by Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, is currently treated with drug-based therapies, but an increase in drug resistance has led to the need for new methods of treatment. BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate. The 23-megabase genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, contains â¼5300 genes, most of unknown function or lacking homologs in other organisms. Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in Nouakchott and that P. vivax is the principal causative agent. Plasmodium vivax was the main causative agent followed by Plasmodium falciparum. Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa that includes several important human pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum, the major causative agent of human malaria, contains three separate genomes. Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria, are transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes resulting in over 250 million new infections each year. The genus Plasmodium, causative agent of malaria, of the phylum Apicomplexa, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a circular and/or tandemly repeated linear element of 6 kb, encoding only three protein genes (cox1, cox3, and cob). Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the apicoplast organelle during the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases. For transmission to occur, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must complete a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. FQ is able to overcome the CQ resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. Some lycorine ester derivatives including LT1 were examined for their inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the parasite associated with sleeping sickness, and against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. A three-dimensional structure of histo-aspartic protease (HAP), a pepsin-like enzyme from the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, is suggested on the basis of homologous modeling followed by equilibration by the method of molecular dynamics. BACKGROUND: Understanding gene regulation in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is an important step in deciphering its complex life cycle as well as leading to possible new targets for therapeutic applications. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies on a complex protein-secretion system for protein targeting into numerous subcellular destinations. We have evaluated a technology called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) for high throughput identification and prioritization of novel target antigens from genomic sequence data using the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, as a model.

56c868a95795f9a73e000017	What is the application of the Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assay in Drosophila embryos?	Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms. This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant developing context. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC partnership as an illustrative test case. This protocol applies to any transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general. The understanding of developmental complexity will, therefore, require the characterization of protein interactions within their proper environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technology offers this possibility as it enables the direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo. Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters. Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions. We next used BiFC in a candidate interaction screen, which led to the identification of several Hox protein partners. Using fluorescent proteins, we previously developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and a multicolor BiFC assay to visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay represents one of these imaging tools for direct visualization of PPIs in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides an approach for the visualization of protein interactions and modifications in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides a direct approach for the visualization of molecular interactions in living cells and organisms. The purpose of this protocol is to calculate signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and to provide a semi-quantitative analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) in living cells. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells.

5880e417713cbdfd3d000001	Which disease is treated with ZMapp?	This includes agents belonging to various therapeutic classes, namely direct antiviral agents (favipiravir and BCX4430), a combination of antibodies (ZMapp), type I interferons, RNA interference-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and anticoagulant drugs (rNAPc2).  During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients.  Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics.  The human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail ZMapp, previously shown to be efficacious in EBOV (variant Kikwit) lethally infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administration was initiated up to 5 days, was used in some patients during the outbreak. We show that a two-antibody cocktail, MIL77E, is fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV variant Makona, the virus responsible for the ongoing 2014-2015 outbreak, whereas a similar formulation of ZMapp protected two of three NHPs.  The growing promise of plant-made biologics is highlighted by the success story of ZMappâ¢ as a potentially life-saving drug during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.  Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp. Background Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Several patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA, brincidofovir, and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics. Also there is no specific vaccine and treatment for Ebola virus; however, many candidate vaccines and antiviral-drugs such as ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are being developed for Ebola virus disease. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus Infection. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola.  Going forward, this work now provides a basis for strategic selection of next-generation antibody cocktails against Ebola and related viruses and a model for predicting the impact of ZMapp on potential escape mutations in ongoing or future Ebola outbreaks. Some potential therapeutic materials including ZMapp were supplied and the treated people got over the EVD. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. This review explores some of the more prominent recent advances in the biofarming of viral vaccines and therapies, including the recent use of ZMapp for Ebolavirus infection, and explores some possible future applications of the technology. During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. For example, several patients of the present Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa were treated with ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies which are expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp. Gene Transfer of ZMapp Antibodies Mediated by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Protects Against Ebola Infections. Vectored delivery of the ZMapp antibody cocktail (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) by using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) could be useful for preventive immunization against Ebola virus infections because rAAVs can generate long-term antibody expression. ZMapp Reinforces the Airway Mucosal Barrier Against Ebola Virus. Addition of ZMapp, a cocktail of Ebola-binding immunoglobulin G antibodies, effectively reduced mobility of Ebola pseudovirus in the same mucus secretions. Topical delivery of ZMapp to the mouse airways also facilitated rapid elimination of Ebola pseudovirus.  Several strategies have been developed in the past to treat EBOV infection, including the antibody cocktail ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in nonhuman primate models of infection 1 and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans 2  Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.  Only recently have vaccine or drug regimens for the Ebola virus been developed, including Zmapp and peptides.  Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir, favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp).  The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. However, during the recent outbreak, monoclonal antibody cocktails such as ZMapp, ZMAb and MB-003 were either tested in a human clinical safety and efficacy trial or provided to some based on compassionate grounds. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols.

Upregulation of uc.189 in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinicopathologic value. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients. Uc.189 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which provides a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

52bf19f703868f1b06000002	What is the inheritance pattern of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) caused by RYR2 mutations?	Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrythmogenic disease characterized by exercise--or stress--induced ventricular tachyarrythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases. Previously, autosomal dominant catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT [1]) was mapped to chromosome 1q42-43 with identification of pathogenic mutations in RYR2.  Several mutations in the genes encoding RyR1 and RyR2 have been identified in autosomal dominant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle, such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), central core disease (CCD), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2).

5c632542e842deac6700000d	Which approach was used to diagnose a patient with Cutis Verticis Gyrata-Intellectual Disability (CVG-ID) syndrome?	Cutis Verticis Gyrata-Intellectual Disability (CVG-ID) syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by intellectual disability and scalp folds and furrows that are typically absent at birth and are first noticed after puberty. First reported in 1893, the syndrome was mainly identified in subjects living in psychiatric institutions, where it was found to have a prevalence of up to 11.4%. Most patients were reported in the literature during the first half of the 20th century. CVG-ID is now a less reported and possibly under-recognized syndrome. Here, we report a patient with CVG-ID that was diagnosed using the novel approach of magnetic resonance imaging and we conduct a systematic review of all patients reported in the last 60 years, discussing the core clinical features of this syndrome.

5880aef4c872c95565000001	What is the target of daratumumab?	Dominantly daratumumab (anti-CD38) and elotuzumab (anti-CS1) showed extraordinary effectiveness in phase I/II trials. In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively. Of these agents, CD38-targeting antibodies have marked single agent activity in extensively pretreated MM, and preliminary results from studies with relapsed/refractory patients have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy when daratumumab and isatuximab are combined with other agents Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Neutralization of the therapeutic CD38 antibody or CD38 denaturation on reagent red blood cells mitigates daratumumab interference with transfusion laboratory serologic tests.  Daratumumab is a fully human anti-CD38 IgG1-Îº monoclonal antibody (mAb) currently being evaluated in several Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).  In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. This article focuses on the basic and clinical aspects of several emerging and promising novel MoAbs for MM, such as elotuzumab which targets CS1 and daratumumab which targets CD38. Daratumumab, a novel therapeutic human CD38 monoclonal antibody, induces killing of multiple myeloma and other hematological tumors. Daratumumab is a novel human CD38 monoclonal antibody which kills CD38+ multiple myeloma cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis.To explore the effect of lenalidomide combined with daratumumab, we first carried out standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays in which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell line UM-9 and primary multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients were used as target cells However, we discovered, next to an expected effect of effector (natural killer cells/monocytes) to target (MM cells) ratio on ADCC, a significant association between CD38 expression and daratumumab-mediated ADCC (127 patients), as well as CDC (56 patients) Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab Monotherapy in Multiple Myeloma.

In this regard, some of these novel agents seem promising, such as monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38 - daratumumab or anti-CS1 - elotuzumab) or the kinesin protein inhibitor Arry-520. This is likely to change within the next few years with a number of mAb therapies being assessed in late stage clinical trials, most notably, the anti-CS-1 mAb, elotuzumab, and the anti-CD38 mAb, daratumumab, which are currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for MM. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM), represents a promising target for mAb-based immunotherapy.

Collectively, our results show the versatility of daratumumab to effectively kill CD38-expressing tumor cells, including patient MM cells, via diverse cytotoxic mechanisms. Amongst these antibodies, elotuzumab which targets SLAMF-7 and daratumumab which targets CD38, have been recently approved by FDA for patients with relapsed/refractory MM. This review focuses on the CD38 antigen and its targeting with daratumumab and provides an update on the results of recent clinical studies involving daratumumab. Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab Monotherapy in Multiple Myeloma. We assessed daratumumab, a novel CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a cell surface protein that is overexpressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Daratumumab, a human IgGÎº monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Importantly, IFNÎ³ was able to up-regulate CD38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab.	['CD38']

54e0ace81388e8454a000010	Is APOBEC3B protein predominantly cytoplasmic or nuclear?	A3B is the only family member with steady-state nuclear localization Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase) Our studies suggest that the present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral AID protein during the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in primates However, we found that the predominantly nuclear A3B only weakly restricted infection by HIV-1, HIV-1Îvif, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), while significantly inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition In contrast to the exclusively cytoplasmic A3G, which is inactive against LINE-1 retrotransposition, the A3G/B protein, while localized mainly to the cytoplasm, was also present in the nucleus. Further mutational analysis revealed that residues 18, 19, 22, and 24 in A3B were the major determinants for nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization and antiretroviral activity these observations suggest that changing 4 residues in the amino terminus of A3B not only retargets the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but also enhances its ability to restrict HIV while retaining inhibition of retrotransposition After mitosis, APOBEC3B becomes nuclear, and APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G become cytoplasmic To define the domains of APOBEC3G that determine cytoplasmic localization, comparisons were made with APOBEC3B, which is predominantly nuclear. The mechanism of L1 inhibition did not correlate with an obvious subcellular protein distribution as APOBEC3B appeared predominantly nuclear and APOBEC3F was mostly cytosolic.

I  A 62-year-old Caucasian non-smoking woman was diagnosed with cT4N0M0Â lung adenocarcinoma. Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma investigational ALK inhibitor brigatinib is active in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, initially identified through the analysis of a specific translocation associated with a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently it was demonstrated that ALK is frequently mutated in sporadic cases with advanced neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an important molecular target in neuroblastoma. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogating ALK activity are currently in clinical use for the treatment of ALK-positive (ALK(+)) disease, monotherapy with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors may not be an adequate solution for ALK(+) neuroblastoma patients. Insights into ALK-driven cancers revealed through development of novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. The ALK gene is silent in adult tissues except for restricted sites within the nervous system (consequently, patients with ALK-positive lymphoma produce antibodies to the ALK protein) but is expressed in some neuroblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. BACKGROUND The translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene on chromosome 2p have been identified in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) as oncogenic driver mutations. SUMMARY The ALK protein functions as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase; rearrangements of the ALK gene are associated with the development of NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement lung cancer responds to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor, has been initially identified through its involvement in chromosomal translocations associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements can derive significant clinical benefit from ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Two ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib and ceritinib, are currently approved in Europe for use in ALK-positive NSCLC and several others are in development. This review summarises the latest research on the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, and how this information can guide the management of patients with cancer that is ALK-positive. Genetic rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene occur in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomoas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and other cancers. <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: NSCLC with de novo anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements and EGFR or KRAS mutations co-occur very rarely. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to treatment with an ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (-TKI). The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase was initially discovered as a component of the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene originally discovered nearly 20 years ago in the context of anaplastic large cell lymphoma were identified as oncogenic drivers in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in 2007. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement identifies a population of NSCLCs in whom dysregulation of ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, ALK has been identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas.  Rearrangements in ALK gene and EML4 gene were first described in 2007. This genomic aberration is found in about 2%-8% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is a T cell lymphoma defined by the presence of chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene.  Renal Medullary Carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive malignancy that affects young black individuals with sickle cell trait. No effective treatment is available, resulting in an ominous clinical course, with overall survival averaging less than four months. We report rearrangement of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in a pediatric case of RMC harboring a t(2;10)(p23;q22) translocation  Aberrant ALK activity has been implicated in the oncogenesis of human cancers as a fusion protein in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, systemic histiocytosis and NSCLC or through mutations in the full length protein in hereditary familial neuroblastoma.  Chromosomal rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) occur in a variety of human malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. NPM/ALK is an oncogenic fusion protein expressed in approximately 50% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases. It derives from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with the dimerization domain of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) protein. Rearrangements involving the ALK gene were identified in a variety of cancers, genetic alterations are mutations in the kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which have been found in both somatic and familial neuroblastom  The aim of this study is to investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein expression and underlying genetic aberrations in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), with special attention to clinical and prognostic implications Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) fusion is a distinct molecular subclassification of NSCLC that is targeted by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors.  The discovery of translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers has become a paradigm for precision medicine The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in the pathogenesis of different types of human cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB)	['cancer']

Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average diameter of 10 nm. Ultrastructurally, rhabdoid cells showed paranuclear aggregates and whorls of intermediate filaments with a 9-10 nm diameter. After removing IFs by calcination, electron microscopy revealed hollow silica nanotubes several micrometers long, with outer diameters of 35-55 nm and an average inner diameter of 10 nm (comparable to that of IFs) Intermediate filaments are filaments 10ânm in diameter that make up an important component of the cytoskeleton in most metazoan taxa. Neurofilaments (NFs) are essential cytoskeletal filaments that impart mechanical integrity to nerve cells. They are assembled from three distinct molecular mass proteins that bind to each other to form a 10-nm-diameter filamentous rod with sidearm extensions. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs showed that acidic keratins and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin vitro. Intermediate in diameter between microtubules and microfilaments, IFs constitute the third cytoskeletal filament system of metazoan cells. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a diameter of 100 Angstroms and a low-density core. Further, using cryo-transmission electron microscopy on native, fully hydrated, vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists, both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes, of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately 8 nm.
