In order to find human genomic sites capable of supporting long-term and high-level transgene expression in hPSCs, we performed a lentiviral screen in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We isolated 40 iPSC clones each harboring a single vector copy and characterized the level of transgene expression afforded by each unique integration site. We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The LiPS-A3 line can greatly facilitate the insertion of reporter and other genes in hPSCs. Targeting transgenes in the LiPS-A3S genomic locus can find broad applications in stem cell research and possibly cell and gene therapy.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27898090", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 771, "offsetInEndSection": 1036, "text": "We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE).", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27898090", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 779, "offsetInEndSection": 1044, "text": "We selected one clone , LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange ( RMCE", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27898090", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 771, "offsetInEndSection": 1037, "text": "We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE).", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27898090", "endSection": "abstract"}]}, {"body": "Which disorder is rated by Palmini classification?", "documents": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219355", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21275980", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23667118", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743217", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17535679", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642611", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296541", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23899121", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25601060", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20618424", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551067", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22844307", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649461", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15965699", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510082"], "ideal_answer": ["Palmini classification system is used for classification of focal cortical dysplasia."], "exact_answer": ["focal cortical dysplasia"], "concepts": ["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2016/MB_cgi?field=uid&exact=Find+Exact+Term&term=D002965"], "type": "factoid", "id": "56c1f020ef6e394741000047", "snippets": [{"offsetInBeginSection": 407, "offsetInEndSection": 584, "text": "This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743217", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 1242, "offsetInEndSection": 1492, "text": "Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB.
