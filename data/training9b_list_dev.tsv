Different cutaneous side effects have been described for anti-TNF-α therapy such as psoriasis Anti-TNF drug-induced alopecia is a less well-known side effect of this class of drugs. 3 patients who developed scalp alopecia Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis induced in a patient treated with infliximab for Crohn's disease side effects appearing in about a fifth of the patients, including myelosuppression and liver toxicity Persistent corneal endothelial deposits associated with rifabutin therapy for Crohn's disease complained of alopecia 3 days after starting 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and then developed severe myelosuppression Leucopoenia was the more frequent side effect observed, occurring in 36 (34%) Nausea, vomit, although slight, occurred in 29 (27.4%) Nodular regenerative hyperplasia as a side effect of azathioprine in a patient with Crohn's disease The whole blood count revealed a pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia and slightly elevated transaminases Analysis of the liver histology was highly suggestive of an azathioprine-related, nodular regenerative hyperplasia 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) known to be associated with CD treatment (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), serious infections, and lymphoma) Severe pulmonary toxicity after azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine initiation for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease A severe side effect is acute pancreatitis, which is specific for Crohn's disease Recurrent myopericarditis in association with Crohn's disease Interstitial nephritis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with mesalamine Pancreatitis in a patient with Crohn disease treated with mesalazine and azathioprine Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are observed mostly as a side effect of therapy, particularly with use of immunosuppressive drugs Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is rarely reported in association with inflammatory bowel disease. resulted to watery stools, vomiting, and fever Eosionophilia was present and the lymphocyte stimulation test with mesalazine was positive Pericarditis as a side effect induced by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid The commonest side-effect was hyperaesthesia, but one patient developed nephrotoxicity and one developed hepatotoxicity The only troublesome side effect is paresthesia, which apparently is dose-related and not progressive The only major side effect observed was paresthesias.

We use piecewise constant intensity models with varying number of pieces, and show how a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method can be used to obtain a posteriori distribution on the intensity of the patterns along the genome. We introduce Markov models for segmentation of symbolic sequences, extending a segmentation procedure based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence that has been introduced earlier.  Our method is based on a combinatorial genome segmentation solely using information on combinations of epigenetic marks.

515df86a298dcd4e5100002e	List co-morbidities that may occur together with "Stiff man Syndrome"	To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves' disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature. This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves' disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with immunosuppressive therapy. HCV may be the etiologic virus of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity; a rare disorder similar to stiff-man syndrome although different because it is progressive and fatal. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS. GAD has been suggested as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). GAD-65 is a dominant autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An elderly man with progressive dementia and concomitant development of stiff-man syndrome is described. He had not had stiff-man syndrome one year earlier, when he had only mild dementia. An association between stiff-man syndrome and dementia has not been previously described. It is possible that this patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia.

54fb5c69d176fff445000003	Which are the 3 basic transcription factors that have been used for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte like-cells?	Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT). Here we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for in vitro cardiac reprogramming using retroviruses encoding GMT. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C.  Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors. Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.  We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, in vitro and in vivo. To assess the efficiency of direct fibroblast reprogramming via viral overexpression of GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT).   In addition, transplantation of GMT infected CFs into injured mouse hearts resulted in decreased cell survival with minimal induction of cardiomyocyte genes. Here, to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes. Through this screening method the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4 that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously. More recently, we showed that reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo after coronary artery ligation using three cardiac transcription factors (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) offers an alternative approach to regenerate heart muscle. Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Srivastava's group reported the first direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblast cells into mesoderm lineage cells (cardiomyocytes) with the enforced expression of three cardiac transcriptional factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.

52f8995b2059c6d71c00004a	Which genes have been found to be associated with restless leg syndrome	We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS).  The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin.  A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.  In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P(nom)≤0.004, ORs 1.52 and 1.55), whereas, in the Greek sample, there was a trend for association to MAP2K5/SKOR1 and BTBD9  This is the first demonstration of a genetic influence on RLS in ESRD patients with BTBD9 being significantly associated. Four family members developed dopa-responsive dystonia, with onset in their late teens, and subsequently developed restless leg syndrome and migraine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an intragenic guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 duplication in a dopa-responsive dystonia family. To date, no gene mutation has been found, but five gene loci have been mapped in primary RLS to chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, and 20p (RLS1 through 5) We demonstrate linkage to a locus on chromosome 9p that is probably distinct from RLS3. Our family with a rather homogeneous phenotype and very early disease onset represents a unique opportunity to further elucidate the genetic causes of the frequent restless leg syndrome.

589c215778275d0c4a00003c	Which enzymes synthesize catecholamines in adrenal glands?	We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls. This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.  In the adrenal medulla, despite the absence of morphological changes, immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenyl-ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase demonstrated an increased immunopositivity for these cathecolamine-synthesizing enzymes after intense exercise.  Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals. However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group. There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57.3%, P<0.004) in adrenal glands of obese mice. Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47.0%, P<0.005). Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected.  Differential housing (single vs. group) and social defeat of rats is known to alter the activity of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the medulla. The present studies examined the effect of 70 days of triad (3 rats per large cage) and individual housing of male rats on adrenal mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and on TH protein levels. As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands.  We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas.  These findings indicate that catecholamine overproduction in pheochromocytomas is mediated by the overexpression of genes coding for catecholamines synthesizing enzymes, TH, DBH, and AADC. he present study investigated the cellular localization of 3 catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)  tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) the rate limiting catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme and also of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in sympathetic ganglia and adrenals This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.

5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e	Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads	mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads? RNA-Seq is currently used routinely, and it provides accurate information on gene transcription. However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results.RESULTS: We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads?mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.

5abce6acfcf4565872000022	Please list 7 classes of drugs that interact with Warfarin.	The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs The number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil,   potential drug interaction exists between oral corticosteroids and warfarin, but there is limited documentation. Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction. We review the possible mechanisms of this interaction and the reported interactions between warfarin and other protease inhibitors. It is necessary to intensify warfarin monitoring upon initiation or alteration of hormonal contraceptives. To report a single patient case that presented with a probable drug interaction between warfarin and 3 methods of hormonal contraceptives, as assessed by the Horn Interaction Probability Scale. Warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults of an outpatient anticoagulation clinic Several classes of drugs, such as antibiotics, may interact with warfarin to cause an increase in warfarins anticoagulant activity and the clinical relevance of warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults is not clear. As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. The most commonly identified potentially interacting medication pairs were warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6824 cases), theophylline/aminophylline and ciprofloxacin/fluvoxamine (930), and warfarin and barbiturates (567). Among 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin, fluconazole, amiodarone, and omeprazole were associated with the requirement for 45.8, 16.7, and 16.7% lower median warfarin dose (all P<0.05 with a false discovery rate <0.05). The results demonstrate a high prevalence of concomitant drug prescriptions with the potential for clinically relevant DDIs with warfarin, the most frequent being acetylsalicylic acid and amiodarone We provide new support for the previous scarce evidence of interactions between warfarin and carbamazepine, bezafibrate, and lactulose.   Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. Of the antidepressants analyzed, those that showed relevant effects on the interaction with warfarin were, in decreasing order: paroxetine, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and duloxetine. Isomeric differences in metabolism form an important basis for stereoselective metabolic interactions, especially inhibition; this has been demonstrated with phenylbutazone, metronidazole and co-trimoxazole Miconazole and nystatin used as topical antifungal drugs interact equally strongly with warfarin. A retrospective case series published in 2012 concluded that miconazole and nystatin used as topical antifungal drugs appear to interact equally strongly with warfarin.  trazodone (2.2%) and carbamazepine (1.1%). The most commonly prescribed agents independently associated with increased bleeding risk were cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Metabolic interaction between warfarin and antiretrovirals is likely, particularly if NNRTIs or PIs are included in the antiretroviral regimen.

54cf705ff693c3b16b000014	List receptors of the drug Cilengitide	Cilengitide inhibits attachment and invasion of malignant pleural mesothelioma cells through antagonism of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide, an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development. As there is evidence for expression of the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin αv heterodimer with high specificity for αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of αvβ3 and αvβ5. Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy.  Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors. RESULTS: αvβ5 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas αvβ3 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 μg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines.  UW479 cells expressed only αvβ5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on αvβ3 inhibition. Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on αvβ3 expression and sensitivity to anoikis.  METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8).  The αVβ3/αVβ5 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model. Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.   Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence.  Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma. The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases.  We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of α(v)β(3) and α(v)β(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA.  AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting αvβ(3)/α(v) β(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ(3) and αvβ(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).   In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that αvβ(3)/αvβ(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases. Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma.  Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study.  In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040).  Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors. BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist.  Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours. A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity.  This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2.  The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases	[['αvβ3 integrin'], ['ανβ5 integrin'], ['αvβ5', 'αvβ3']]

Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1.

5a99566e1d1251d03b00000f	With which personality traits has the human monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene been associated?	Association of monoamine oxidase-A genetic variants and amygdala morphology in violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder and high psychopathic traits. The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations Monoamine Oxidase-A Genetic Variants and Childhood Abuse Predict Impulsiveness in Borderline Personality Disorder.  These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD. Elevated Monoamine Oxidase-A Distribution Volume in Borderline Personality Disorder Is Associated With Severity Across Mood Symptoms, Suicidality, and Cognition. These results suggest that elevated MAO-A VT is associated with multiple indicators of BPD severity, including BPD symptomatology, mood symptoms, suicidality, and neurocognitive impairment. No association between a polymorphism in the promoter region of the MAOA gene with antisocial personality traits in alcoholics. Taken together, these findings suggest that the three-repeat allele of the MAOAuVNTR 30-bp polymorphism is not associated with impulsive and aggressive personality traits. Different allele distribution of a regulatory MAOA gene promoter polymorphism in antisocial and anxious-depressive alcoholics The present study tested whether a novel functional polymorphism in the promotor region of the X-chromosomal monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) was related to antisocial and anxious-depressive traits in alcoholics. aken together, these findings suggest that the 3-repeat allele of the MAOA polymorphism contributes modestly to the dimension of overand underreactive behaviors as possible antecedents of alcoholism. Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males.  A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been shown to moderate the impact of maltreatment on antisocial behaviour. Non-linear interactions between the MAOA gene and violence were detected, suggesting that the genetic moderation may come about once a certain level of violence is experienced The history of research on the association between platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and personality traits, such as sensation seeking and impulsiveness, is reviewed.  Monoamine oxidase a gene is associated with borderline personality disorder. As for its role in aggression, impulsivity, suicide and mood liability, monoamine oxidase A can be considered a functional candidate in borderline personality disorder. These results show that the monoamine oxidase A gene may play an important role in the etiological development of the borderline personality disorder. Gene environment interactions with a novel variable Monoamine Oxidase A transcriptional enhancer are associated with antisocial personality disorder. However, clinical associations between this VNTR genotype and behavioral states have been inconsistent.  Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter methylation and transcriptional downregulation in an offender population with antisocial personality disorder. hese results are consistent with prior literature suggesting MAOA and serotonergic dysregulation in antisocial populations. Our results offer the first evidence suggesting epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to MAOA dysregulation in antisocial offenders. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. Allelic variation of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been implicated in conduct disorder and antisocial, aggressive behavior in humans when associated with early adverse experiences. By conferring allele-specific transcriptional activity on the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence [(variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR)] in the MAOA promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Genotypes with three-repeat alleles were reported to be associated with antisocial as well as impulsive traits. Platelet MAO-B activity has been associated with psychopathy- and aggression-related personality traits, while variants of the MAOA and MAOB genes have been associated with diverse clinical phenotypes, including aggressiveness, antisocial problems and violent delinquency. Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. CONCLUSION Taken together, these findings suggest that the MAOA-L genotype is to some extent associated with impulsive and antisocial personality traits in alcoholic men. Relationship of monoamine oxidase A binding to adaptive and maladaptive personality traits. Cluster B personality disorders are associated with allelic variation of monoamine oxidase A activity.

5173eb428ed59a060a000021	What type of cancers and inherited diseases have been associated to mutations in the Notch pathway?	Comparative functional genomic analysis identified a signature of Notch activation in 30% of HCC samples from patients. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers. We detected Notch1 missense mutations in 8.3% of the tumors (only in the posterior fossa location and in case of 9q33-34 gain). Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome. In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome. Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we describe a new candidate gene isolated from array comparative genomic hybridization redundant 6qter deletions, DELTA Like 1 (DLL1), which is a ligand of NOTCH. Four genes causing a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease have been identified: DLL3 (SCDO1: MIM 277300), MESP2 (SCDO2: MIM 608681), LFNG (SCDO3: MIM609813) and HES7 (SCDO4). These genes are all essential components of the Notch signalling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Previously, only a single SCD-causative missense mutation was described in HES7. In this study, we have identified two new missense mutations in the HES7 gene in a single family, Here we have used autozygosity mapping to identify a mutation in a fourth Notch pathway gene, Hairy-and-Enhancer-of-Split-7 (HES7), in an autosomal recessive SCD family. Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals. Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously. Altogether 226 different JAG1 mutations have been described in association with AGS, including our novel 36 mutations. Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of JAG1 mutations result in AGS. These include total gene deletions, protein truncating, splicing and missense mutations which are distributed across the coding region of the gene. Here we present results of JAG1 mutation screening by SSCP and FISH in 105 patients with AGS. For these studies, new primers were designed for 12 exons. Mutations were identified in 63/105 patients (60%) We have screened 54 AGS probands and family members to determine the frequency of mutations in JAG1. Three patients (6%) had deletions of the entire gene. Of the remaining 51 patients, 35 (69%) had mutations within JAG1, identified by SSCP analysis. Of the 35 identified intragenic mutations, all were unique, with the exceptions of a 5-bp deletion in exon 16, seen in two unrelated patients, and a C insertion at base 1618 in exon 9, also seen in two unrelated patients. Analyses of many patients with cytogenetic deletions or rearrangements have mapped the gene to chromosome 20p12, although deletions are found in a relatively small proportion of patients (< 7%). We have mapped the human Jagged1 gene (JAG1), encoding a ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, to the Alagille syndrome critical region within 20p12.

5c72d4c77c78d6947100007c	Which proteins form the nuclear pore basket in human cells?	Nup133 Is Required for Proper Nuclear Pore Basket Assembly and Dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells. Here we show that the NPC basket proteins Nup1 and Nup60 directly induce membrane curvature by amphipathic helix insertion into the lipid bilayer Moreover, the association of TREX-2 with the NPC requires the basket nucleoporins NUP153 and TPR, but is independent of transcription.   In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket components, were unevenly distributed in the NE and, unlike wild-type NPCs, were mobile within the NE Incorporation of the nuclear pore basket protein nup153 into nuclear pore structures is dependent upon lamina assembly: evidence from cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs. Using light and EM immunolocalization, we determined that mammalian Tpr is concentrated within the nuclear basket of the pore complex in a distribution similar to Nup153 and Nup98. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy localize vertebrate Nup93 at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear entry to the gated channel of the pore. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. Nup153 is a molecular constituent of the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that plays a critical role in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins. The nucleoporins Nup60p, Nup2p, and Nup1p form part of the nuclear basket structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear pore complex (NPC). By postembedding immunoelectron microscopy, we have mapped the positions of several human NPC proteins relative to the NPC core and its associated basket, including Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, Nup153, Nup205, and the coiled coil-dominated 267-kDa protein Tpr. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153. When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. One such protein, the nucleoporin Nup153, is localized to the nuclear basket of the pore complex and has been shown to be a central component of the nuclear transport machinery. Here, one SLAP is identified as the nuclear pore complex protein Nup153, one member of the F/GXFG motif-containing nucleoporins.  Nup133 Is Required for Proper Nuclear Pore Basket Assembly and Dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells.Nup133 belongs to the Y-complex, a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold.  The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins.The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large proteinaceous structure through which bidirectional transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (NE) takes place.  To further assess their contributions to NPC and basket architecture, the genes encoding Nup93, Nup96, Nup107, and Nup205 were posttranscriptionally silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, complementing recent RNAi experiments on Nup153 and Tpr. Immunogold-labeling for Nup98 also results in preferential labeling of NPC core regions, whereas Nup153 is shown to bind via its amino-terminal domain to the nuclear coaxial ring linking the NPC core structures and Tpr. Ulp1, whose maintenance at nuclear pores depends on the Nup84 complex, impacts on THO-dependent gene expression, whereas the nuclear basket-associated Mlp1/Pml39 proteins prevent pre-mRNA export at a later stage, contributing to mRNA quality control.

54fb6fb5d176fff445000004	Which proteins participate in the formation of the Notch transcriptional activation complex?	The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding factor CSL and a transcriptional co-activator of the Mastermind family (MAML). The "RAM" region of NICD recruits Notch to CSL, facilitating the binding of MAML at the interface between the ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain of NICD and CSL. Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression. Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled. Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane. ICN then travels into the nucleus where it drives the assembly of a transcriptional activation complex containing the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL, ICN, and a specialized co-activator of the Mastermind family. A consensus DNA binding site motif for the CSL protein was previously defined using selection-based methods, but whether subsequent association of Notch and Mastermind-like proteins affects the DNA binding preferences of CSL has not previously been examined. We report here the crystal structure of a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing the ankyrin domain of human Notch1 (ANK), the transcription factor CSL on cognate DNA, and a polypeptide from the coactivator Mastermind-like-1 (MAML-1).  Ligand binding by Notch receptors triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that liberate the intracellular portion of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane, permitting it to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex. On the basis of our results, we present a working structural model for the organization of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading. We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis. Mastermind (Mam) is a component of Notch pathway signaling. In combination with the intracellular domain of Notch and Suppressor of Hairless, Mam forms a transcriptional activation complex. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA. This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member NotchIC, together with the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind, form a ternary complex with CSL that activates transcription from genes that are responsive to Notch signaling Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex	[['Notch intracellular domain (NICD)', 'NICD', 'Intracellular part of Notch', 'ICN', 'NIC'], ['Transcription factor CSL', 'RBP-Jkappa', 'CBF1', 'Suppressor of Hairless', 'Lag-1'], ['The coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1', 'MAML-1']]

CaMK4-dependent activation of AKT/mTOR and CREM-α underlies autoimmunity-associated Th17 imbalance  Here, we present evidence that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) is increased and required during Th17 cell differentiation. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator α (CREM-α) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. CaMK4 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for Th17-driven autoimmune diseases. CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling CaMK4 inhibition significantly decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, and lactate, whereas it did not affect the levels of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates such as 6-Phospho-D-gluconate, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate	[['Th17 differentiation'], ['reduction of Il17 expression'], ['decreased activation of cAMP']]

52bf1f4503868f1b06000016	For the treatment of which conditions can atypical neuroleptic drugs be used?	Further clinical implications are described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations). Intervention strategies are a multimodal psychological programme for the intervention in early prodromal stages and a combination of psychotherapy with atypical neuroleptic drugs in the late prodromal stages.  Atypical neuroleptic drugs have enriched our treatment programs, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. Reviewed here is the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder.  o prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated. The handwriting of 18 schizophrenic patients before and during treatment with typical (haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate) and atypical (clozapine, risperidone) neuroleptic drugs was examined. Atypical and typical neuroleptics, when administered chronically, can bring about profound but contrasting changes in schizophrenic symptoms and motor activation and dramatically modulate brain neurochemistry Recent studies suggest that clozapine is more effective than typical neuroleptics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Acute and late onset movement disorders frequently complicate the treatment of psychosis with typical neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol, but not with atypical neuroleptic drugs like clozapine.  Only the group of boys presented other comorbidities such as negativism and conduct disorders; approximately 25% of them required treatment with atypical neuroleptic drugs. Atypical neuroleptic drugs are the preferred treatment for symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behaviour. Monotherapeutic treatment with new atypical neuroleptic drugs had a more positive effect on the mental health related quality of life (MCS) in comparison to treatment with polypharmacological treatment but not with oral conventional antipsychotics.

515de748298dcd4e51000023	List all approved indications for Glivec	The limited available experience suggests that imatinib could be considered as an individualized treatment approach in severe SSc and underscores the need to identify markers for selecting particular patients, who will safely respond to therapeutic inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon cutaneous neoplasm Moreover, even when surgery is utilized, there are cases where positive margins remain, in which case imatinib would be an option, often in combination with surgery. Imatinib can decrease tumor size preoperatively and help to improve postsurgical aesthetic appearance and minimize functional impairment. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Treatment with adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection of localized Kit-positive GIST, the most recent FDA-approved indication (December 2008), has been shown to significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with surgical resection alone Currently, there are no clinical recommendations regarding how to incorporate imatinib drug plasma monitoring in patients with either chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors, indications for which imatinib is approved. Imatinib was effective against GIST that were positive for KIT protein The introduction of alternative therapies, such as imatinib for CML, has challenged well-established indications. More micro-GIST are discovered with the development of investigations, rising the question of wait and see policy for some of them. In locally advanced inoperable patients and metastatic patients, Imatinib is the standard treatment. The introduction of alternative therapies has challenged well-established indications such as imatinib for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals East Manruer, NJ) received accelerated approval on May 10, 2001 for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in (a) chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha therapy, (b) accelerated phase, and (c) blast crisis. Gleevec (imatinib mesylate), a highly promising new drug for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, in accelerated phase, and in chronic phase after interferon failure or intolerance, received orphan drug status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development on January 31, 2001, and accelerated approval from the FDA for the above three indications on May 10, 2001.

58a2fac960087bc10a000009	Which are the side effects during tacrine administration in patients with Alzheimer's Disease?	Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Tacrine and its analogues impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics: a lipidomic analysis in rat brain. However, its low therapeutic efficiency and a high incidence of side effects have limited its clinical use.  Tacrine induced significant perturbations in the mitochondrial PL profile, which were detected by means of changes in the relative abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and CL and by the presence of oxidized phosphatidylserines. These results indicate that tacrine and its analogues impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics, thus compromising the activity of brain cells. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity.  The antidementives are well tolerated and undesired effects are rare; except hepatotoxicity of tacrine and gastrointestinal side effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamin and tacrine that result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss are the most common side effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.  Raised serum liver enzymes was the major reason for withdrawal.  Gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia and abdominal pain) were the other major cause of adverse events and for withdrawal, and the odds ratio for withdrawal was also significantly different from one in favour of the control group (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.8-5.1). To determine the clinical efficacy of tacrine for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, cognition now responds to several drugs.

571653aecb4ef8864c000005	Which are the most common methods for ctDNA (circulating tumour DNA) detection?	existing methods for ctDNA detection are restricted to genetic mutations. Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform. The practice of "liquid biopsy" as a diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic tool in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is an appealing approach, at least in theory, since it is noninvasive and easily repeated Here we introduce cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA.  Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq. We envision that CAPP-Seq could be routinely applied clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies, thus facilitating personalized cancer therapy. Synthesis of a new Ni-phenanthroline complex and its application as an electrochemical probe for detection of nucleic acid A new DNA sensor using a nickel(II) phenanthroline complex ([Ni(phen)(2)PHPIP]·2ClO(4)) as the electrochemical probe was developed.

Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012.  Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family primarily spread through arthropod vectors, and are the major causes of illness and death around the globe. The Flaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus (type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type species, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus diarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to propagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. Despite the extensive research and public health concern associated with flavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any flavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist.

5156be75d24251bc05000088	Which diseases is microRNA 132 (miR-132) implicated in?	Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNA are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy. Inflammation, stress signalling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes a chronic immuno-inflammatory response in the eye that may result in corneal neovascularization during blinding immunopathological lesion stromal keratitis (SK). miR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that is induced in endothelial cells in response to growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17. The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease. Manipulating miRNA expression holds promise as a therapeutic approach to control an ocular lesion that is an important cause of human blindness. Role of miR-132 in angiogenesis The cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identified 26 genes up-regulated in schizophrenia subjects. Our data suggest miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments. Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain.

5ace20fa0340b9f05800000c	Which genes are responsible for the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans?	We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.  In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1.  Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Identification of a Tibetan-specific mutation in the hypoxic gene EGLN1 and its contribution to high-altitude adaptation. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion). The estimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (∼8,400 years ago).  Two functional loci in the promoter of EPAS1 gene involved in high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans. EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude.  HMOX2 Functions as a Modifier Gene for High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetans. In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans.  Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism. Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population.  Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration. Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans. The Tibetan-specific 200 kb EPAS1 haplotype introgressed from an archaic human population related to Denisovans which underwent evolutionary decay; however, the functional variant(s) responsible for high-altitude adaptation at EPAS1/HIF-2α have not yet been identified. Further functional analysis revealed that lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene, which was reported to be responsible for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking of amnion previously, was a direct target of EPAS1.

515deafd298dcd4e51000025	List the endoscopic diagnoses that have been reported in children with autism	Autism and esophageal achalasia in childhood: a possible correlation? In the last case, a 15-year-old male underwent barium swallow and endoscopy that confirmed achalasia. Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children. A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation. Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls. METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69.4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24. The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration. Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea. Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients. The observed increase in pancreatico-biliary secretion after secretin infusion suggests an upregulation of secretin receptors in the pancreas and liver. three children with autistic spectrum disorders who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and intravenous administration of secretin to stimulate pancreaticobiliary secretion. All three had an increased pancreaticobiliary secretory response when compared with nonautistic patients (	[['Reflux esophagitis'], ['Achalasia'], ['chronic gastritis'], ['chronic duodenitis'], ['inflammation of the small bowel and colorectum'], ['Ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH)']]
5cf0f567a49efeb44c00000b	Which are the main G1/S transcription factors in yeast?	To understand how commitment to cell division in late G1 phase (Start) is controlled by growth and nutrients in budding yeast, we determined the absolute concentrations of the G1/S transcription factors SBF (composed of Swi4 and Swi6) and MBF (composed of Mbp1 and Swi6), the transcriptional repressor Whi5, and the G1 cyclins, Cln1 and Cln2, in single live yeast cells using scanning number and brightness (sN&B) microscopy. We previously isolated the SKN7 gene in a screen designed to isolate new components of the G1-S cell cycle transcription machinery in budding yeast. We have now found that Skn7 associates with Mbp1, the DNA-binding component of the G1-S transcription factor DSC1/MBF To gain more insight into the G(1)/S circuitry, we characterized Swi6p, Swi4p and Mbp1p, the closest orthologues of SBF (Swi6p and Swi4p) and MBF (Swi6p and Mbp1p) components in S. cerevisiae The G(1)/S transition is a critical control point for cell proliferation and involves essential transcription complexes termed SBF and MBF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or MBF in Schizosaccharomyces pombe In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G1/S transcription factors MBF and SBF regulate a large family of genes important for entry to the cell cycle and DNA replication and repair.   MBF and SBF consist of a common component, Swi6, and a DNA-specific binding protein, Mbp1 and Swi4, respectively. Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively.

516c0ebc298dcd4e5100006e	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?	our data suggests that TRbeta1-mediated down regulation of hepatic LDLr gene may play a critical role in iodine excess-induced hypercholesterolemic effects. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. However, the T3-activated expression of the GH gene in GH3-PV and ME gene in SK-Hep-1-PV was repressed by approximately 30% and 90%, respectively, indicating the lack of correlation of PV/TRpbeta1 protein ratio with the dominant negative potency of mutant PV. Transient cotransfection of P450R promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs and the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TR beta1) expression plasmid into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells resulted in a 2.4-fold induction of promoter activity that was both T3 and TR beta1 dependent. At the molecular level, we detected a dose-dependent attenuation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) expression in parallel to the change of serum cholesterol.

52bf1af803868f1b06000008	Which diseases are caused by mutations in Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene?	Recessively inherited CPVT is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene. It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia.  The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene. In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p.L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT.  These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease. Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT. Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease. We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT. Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p.Y55C (c.164A>G) and p.P308L (c.923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene.  A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT. Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations.  We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles.  The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias. Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT.  Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.  These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT. This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT. An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu). These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population.

52f895602059c6d71c000040	List tele monitoring applications of miniaturised sensors	Home-polysomnography (HPSG) has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis. We assessed, in a feasibility study, whether telematic transmission using the Dream® and Sleepbox® technologies was associated with low HPSG failure rate  In this study, we monitored remotely self-measured body weight and blood pressure, in parallel with the data automatically transmitted by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Body weight, patient activity, and the difference between MHR and RHR are mutually correlated and may reasonably contribute to an algorithm for predicting heart failure deterioration. Blood pressure appears to offer no additional value. As both genesis and symptoms of heart failure exacerbation are non-uniform and complex, the telemonitoring concepts for heart failure patients should employ continuous monitoring of multiple diagnostic parameters, rather than rely on a single parameter.

534ab91eaeec6fbd07000012	Which genes were found to be methylated in bladder cancer cells?	CpG island in promoter of hepaCAM gene was hyper-methylated both in bladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines (T24 and BIU-87). Otherwise, aberrant methylation of its promoter was associated with its decreased expression. Abnormal hypermethylation in CpG island of hepaCAM promoter is involved in absence of hepaCAM gene expression when bladder cancer occurs. Methylated RARβ(2) and APC were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients (62.8%, 59.5%) than benign (16.4%, 5%) but not detected in healthy volunteers (0%) at (P < 0.0001). Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73.4%) showed methylated RARβ(2) and 86 (67.2%) showed methylated APC. Thus, methylated RARβ(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer. Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells. hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells. Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation.

Developmental delay was noted on follow-up which raised the possibility of intermediate DEND syndrome. We have verified a lack of clinical response for both glycemic control and neurological features in an infant with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and DEND syndrome due to a V59A mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.  They also may cause neurologic symptoms such as mental retardation and motor problems (iDEND syndrome) and epilepsy (DEND syndrome).

Considering the hematological findings and clinical appearance, we suspected RS, which was confirmed by genetic tests. CONCLUSIONS: RS is an extremely rare condition.  The initial symptomatology could be ophthalmological or hematological. The patient was found to have a TINF2 mutation consistent with a diagnosis of Revesz syndrome, a variant of dyskeratosis congenita. He underwent successful bone marrow transplantation, and on subsequent evaluation was found to have retinal hemorrhages, vessel sclerosis, and cotton wool spots in the right eye associated with peripheral retinal nonperfusion.  These "telomeropathies" also include Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH) and Revesz syndrome, which are severe forms of dyskeratosis congenita, as well as a subset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, aplastic anemia, and Coats' plus syndrome. Retinopathy has only rarely been reported in DC and HH, but is universally present in Coats' plus and Revesz syndromes.  Revesz syndrome, a subtype of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) caused by TINF2 mutation, combines marrow failure with exudative retinopathy, intracranial calcifications, and neurocognitive impairment. Revesz syndrome, a variant disorder, is characterized by retinopathy, aplastic anemia, nail dystrophy, and cerebellar hypoplasia.  A 5-year-old girl was admitted with pallor, hypopigmented sparse hair, tongue ulcers, atrophic nail changes, hypoplastic anemia and bilateral exudative retinopathy. A diagnosis of Revesz syndrome was made.  Revesz syndrome is a variant of dyskeratosis congenita characterized by aplastic anemia, retinopathy, and central nervous system abnormalities.  BACKGROUND  Revesz syndrome is a telomere disorder in the dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) spectrum characterized by exudative retinopathy, bone marrow failure, neuroradiographic abnormalities, and integumentary findings.

570921e4cf1c325851000017	In which genomic regions are Alu enriched?	There are regions such as the four homeobox gene clusters, which are nearly devoid of these repeats that contrast with repeat dense regions in other transcriptionally active regions of the genome. These elements are more clustered in genes which are involved in metabolism, transport, and signaling processes. In contrast, they are significantly fewer in genes coding for information pathway components as well as structural proteins. This bias in Alu distribution is independent of the effect of Alu density of the flanking genomic region and is also not affected by the GC content of the gene and its upstream and downstream regions. The relative proportions of Alu subfamilies (Alu J, Alu S, and Alu Y) are not significantly different in genes with high Alu density belonging to the functional categories of transport, metabolism, and signaling. We suggest that Alu elements might be involved in regulatory mechanisms and are therefore differentially selected in primate genomes. Sequence analysis demonstrated these "young" Alu insertions represented gene conversion events of pre-existing ancient Alu elements or independent parallel insertions of older Alu elements in the same genomic region.  This study suggests that the majority of Alu insertions in primate genomes are the products of unique evolutionary events. Our screening of the Alu insertion loci also resulted in the recovery of several "young" Alu elements that resided at orthologous positions in nonhuman primate genomes.

58d8d8108acda34529000009	Which mutated genes are associated with isolated ectopia lentis?	A founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes early-onset bilateral ectopia lentis among Jews of Bukharian origin. The term isolated ectopia lentis (EL; subluxation or dislocation of the human crystalline lens) is applied to patients with EL, without skeletal features and in the absence of aortic root dilatation. To date, the only gene shown to cause autosomal-recessive isolated EL is ADAMTSL4. Here we report a novel founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 gene in children of Bukharian Jewish origin presenting with early-onset bilateral EL.  Early onset ectopia lentis due to a FBN1 mutation with non-penetrance. Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene.  In conclusion, we report on a case of early-onset autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis caused by FBN1 mutation that has previously been reported only in Marfan syndrome. ADAMTSL4-associated isolated ectopia lentis: Further patients, novel mutations and a detailed phenotype description. ADAMTSL4 mutations seem to be the most common cause of isolated ectoplia lentis (EL) and thus are important concerning the differential diagnosis of connective tissue syndromes with EL as main feature.  A genotype-phenotype comparison of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 in isolated ectopia lentis. To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene. A novel FBN1 mutation in a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis. To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis (EL) family. A novel mutation of FBN1 results in an arginine to cysteine residue (p.R974C) substitution, which is responsible for the patients with isolated EL in this Chinese family. A homozygous mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes autosomal-recessive isolated ectopia lentis. Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene. To examine the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene for mutations in members of a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis. Ophthalmic findings in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Craniosynostosis with ectopia lentis and a homozygous 20-base deletion in ADAMTSL4. ADAMTSL4-associated isolated ectopia lentis: Further patients, novel mutations and a detailed phenotype description Our study presented detailed clinical manifestations, including some novel ophthalmic findings, such as pupillary abnormality, different types of glaucoma, and progressive hyperopia.Ophthalmic findings and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of FBN1 gene were reported in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis To examine the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene for mutations in members of a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis.Clinically relevant laboratory investigation.Family members underwent clinical examinations Ophthalmic findings in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) The 65 exons of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and direct DNA sequencing.A mutation, c.184C-->T in exon 2 of FBN1, which results in substitution of arginine by cysteine at position 62 of the fibrillin-1 protein (p.R62C) in all affected family members but in none of the unaffected individuals.A recurrent mutation of FBN1 gene resulted in an arginine-to-cysteine residue (p.R62C), is responsible for the patients with isolated ectopia lentis in a Chinese family Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the association of ADAMTSL4 null mutations with isolated ectopia lentis and the presence of a founder mutation in the European population.  Herein we show a consanguineous family that carries a novel homozygous splice mutation IVS4-1G>A/IVS4-1G>A in ADAMTSL4 responsible for isolated autosomal recessive EL, thus confirming the involvement of this gene in this condition and underlining the major role of ADAMTS proteases in zonular fibers homeostasis. Two novel FBN1 mutations associated with ectopia lentis and marfanoid habitus in two Chinese families. Novel FBN1 mutations associated with predominant ectopia lentis and marfanoid habitus in Chinese patients. FBN1 mutations are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes, including Marfan syndrome (MFS), MASS phenotype, and familial ectopia lentis, but rarely with isolated aortic aneurysm and dissection. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes.Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Recently, ADAMTSL4 has been shown to be responsible for isolated autosomal recessive ectopia lentis in an inbred family. Confirmation of ADAMTSL4 mutations for autosomal recessive isolated bilateral ectopia lentis. A recurrent FBN1 mutation in an autosomal dominant ectopia lentis family of Indian origin.

The most common symptoms are fever, skin rash and gastrointestinal disorders. Respiratory symptoms occurred in approximately 20% of patients who have hypersensitivity reaction. We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of hypesensitivity reaction characterized by enanthema and fever without skin rash promptly resolved after discontinuation of abacavir Abacavir is associated with an infrequent but potentially serious hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) that can include a wide range of signs and symptoms. Rash was associated with hypersensitivity (odds ratio [OR] = 13.1, P = 0.02) as was the presence of nausea (OR = 30, P < 0.001), vomiting (OR = 17.1, P = 0.001) or diarrhoea (OR = 22, P < 0.001). The number of gastrointestinal symptoms was also predictive of hypersensitivity reaction ( the number of gastrointestinal symptoms (OR = 8.6, P = 0.0032), cough (OR = 0.039, P = 0.02) and rash (OR = 16.9, P = 0.07).

PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade Bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of DNA replication encode two DNA polymerases III, DnaE and PolC, rather than a single one. SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC-PolE DNA polymerases We conclude that PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE, which may play a direct role in the maintenance of SGD. Furthermore, SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) In contrast, PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade, suggesting at least two origins for the degradosome.

PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment. Methadone is an opioid prescribed for pain management and is also provided through opioid treatment programs to treat opioid use disorders. Fortunately, there are effective medications (ie, methadone, buprenorphine, and oral and injectable naltrexone) available for the treatment of opioid addiction.  We describe the major classes of drug treatments available, including opioid agonist (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM), antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) he development of buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, as an effective treatment for opioid addiction reopened the possibility for having a less burdensome oversight process, Although the synthetic opioid buprenorphine has been available clinically for almost 30 years, its use has only recently become much more widespread for the treatment of opioid addiction	[['methadone'], ['naloxone'], ['suboxone'], ['buprenorphine']]

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000c	List medication interfering with purine metabolism that are used for treatment of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?	Treatment with purine analogues and alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and improved survival.   Treatment with purine analogs and the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and increased survival. Nelarabine is an effective regimen against indolent leukemias, and combining it with fludarabine was most promising. Determination of tumor cell ara-GTP levels may provide a predictive test for response to nelarabine. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia has an aggressive course with short median survival and poor response to chemotherapy. With the use of the purine analogue pentostatin more than half of patients will have a major response and a minority will have a complete remission, usually lasting months.  T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare post-thymic T-cell malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. It has generally been resistant to alkylating chemotherapy, but some effect has been observed with the purine analog 2-deoxycoformicin with documented partial or complete response rates in up to 45% of patients. Fifteen patients with T-PLL, most of whom had received the purine analog deoxycoformycin (DCF), were treated with CAMPATH-1H. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.

5a70dbe599e2c3af26000004	Which two genes are implicated in Juvenile polyposis syndrome?	 JPS is most frequently caused by mutations in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Herein, we report a child with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) with a novel mutation in the SMAD4 gene.  Subsequent genetic screening revealed a novel mutation in SMAD4, exon 5 (p.Ser144Stop).  A SMAD4 mutation indicative of juvenile polyposis syndrome in a family previously diagnosed with Menetrier's disease. CONCLUSION: The 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 is the cause of JPS and the likely cause of MD in a large family initially diagnosed with MD. A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD.  ince his initial diagnosis of JPS further studies have confirmed an association between JPS and mutations in BMPR1A in chromosome band 10q23.2, which is in close proximity to PTEN. Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4. Exome sequencing identified a germline heterozygous mutation in SMAD9 (SMAD9(V90M)).  Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Somatic alterations in juvenile polyps from BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients. The JPS is caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Germline mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A disrupt the transforming growth factor β signal transduction pathway, and are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. Individuals with JPS due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). BMPR1A and SMAD4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. BACKGROUND In patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) the frequency of large genomic deletions in the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes was unknown. in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome jps the frequency of large genomic deletions in the smad4 and bmpr1a genes was unknown mutation and phenotype analysis was used in 80 unrelated patients of whom 65 met the clinical criteria for jps typical

patients with typical jps six deletions in smad4 and three deletions in bmpr1a mutation analysis of the pten gene in the remaining 41 mutation negative cases uncovered a point mutation in two patients 5 smad4 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of gastric polyposis 73 than did patients with bmpr1a mutations 8 p 0 001 all seven cases of gastric cancer occurred in families with smad4 mutations smad4 mutation carriers with gastric polyps were significantly older at gastroscopy than those without p 0 001 in 22 of the 23 unrelated smad4 mutation carriers hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia hht was also diagnosed clinically the documented histologic findings encompassed a wide distribution of different polyp types comparable with that described in hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes hmps screening for large deletions raised the mutation detection rate to 60 in the 65 patients with typical jps a strong genotype phenotype correlation for gastric polyposis gastric cancer and hht was identified which should have implications for counselling and surveillance histopathological results in hamartomatous polyposis syndromes must be critically interpreted. juvenile polyposis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple distinct juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal cancer the cumulative life time risk of colorectal cancer is 39 and the relative risk is 34 juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes clinically juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis in about 50 60 of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the smad4 or bmpr1a gene is found both genes play a role in the bmp tgf beta signalling pathway it has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so called landscaper mechanism where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment follow up and screening of at risk individuals each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome in addition juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer this review discusses clinical manifestations genetics pathogenesis and management of juvenile polyposis syndrome. juvenile polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by multiple juvenile polyps arising in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers specifically colon cancer bmpr1a and smad4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome we identified a bmpr1a mutation which involves a duplication of coding exon 3 c 230 452 333 441dup1995 on multiple ligation dependent probe amplification in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome the mutation causes a frameshift producing a truncated protein p d112nfsx2 therefore the mutation is believed to be pathogenic we also identified a duplication breakpoint in which alu sequences are located these results suggest that the duplication event resulted from recombination between alu sequences to our knowledge partial duplication in the bmpr1a gene has not been reported previously this is the first case report to document coding exon 3 duplication in the bmpr1a gene in

If this hypothesis proves to be true, tau phosphorylation inhibitors can be potential candidates for MS drug development. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques, composed mainly of amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted human The amyloid-forming proteins tau, αB crystallin, and amyloid P protein are all found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and Pick's disease (PiD) are commonly known as tauopathies.

515db20e298dcd4e51000014	What are the current treatments for generalised anxiety disorder in teenagers?	49.3% of the youths with depression had comorbid conditions: anxiety disorders in 23.37% of cases To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a school-based group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders with African-American adolescents. METHODS: Twelve adolescents (mean age = 15.6 years) with anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 6) or a group attention-support control condition At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, compared with 1/5 in AS-Control. Clinician ratings of impairment and self-report levels of overall anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control The present study compares an individual versus a group format in the delivery of manualised cognitive-behavioural therapy (FRIENDS) for children with anxiety disorders. Clinically referred children (aged 8 to 12) diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder (n = 52), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (n = 37), Social Phobia (n = 22) or Specific Phobia (n = 16) were randomly assigned to individual (n = 65) or group (n = 62) treatment. Forty-eight percent of the children in the individual versus 41% in the group treatment were free of any anxiety disorder at post-treatment; 62% versus 54% were free of their primary anxiety disorder. Regression analyses showed no significant difference in outcome between individual and group treatment Children improved in both conditions. Choice between treatments could be based on pragmatic considerations such as therapeutic resources, referral rates, and the preference of the parents and the child.

588f952994c1512c50000007	What are clinical features of the de Morsier syndrome?	 SOD was formerly known as de Morsier syndrome, which associated a midline brain defect such as an absent septum pellucidum with optic nerve hypoplasia. The triad consists of optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and midline brain defects, although it can vary in the severity of clinical presentation and phenotype.  INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have described septooptic dysplasia (SOD) to describe patients who have optic nerve hypoplasia, the absence of septum pellucidum, and pituitary hypoplasia. BACKGROUND: Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.  Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), otherwise called De Morsier syndrome, is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities).  The frequently associated features of hypopituitarism and absent septum pellucidum were felt to have embryonic linkage as "septo-optic dysplasia" or "de Morsier's syndrome." An MRI of the brain demonstrated the absence of the septum pellucidum, which confirmed a diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia or de Morsier syndrome. Septo-optic dysplasia (De Morsier syndrome) is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities. Septo-optic dysplasia, also known as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital entity almost always characterized by hypoplasia/dysplasia of the optical nerve, chiasma or optic radiations and the complete or partial absence of the septum pellucidum. The de Morsier syndrome, or septo-optic dysplasia, is a developmental anomaly characterized by involvement of the optic system, hypothalamic-pituitary axis and septum pellucidum. The term septooptic dysplasia was coined in 1956 by de Morsier, who pointed out the association of optic nerve hypoplasia and absence of the septum pellucidum. Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.

Fluorescein photodiagnosis of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome: A case report and long-term outcome of photocoagulation therapy. Idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome is a disease characterized by multiple retinal macroaneurysms, neuroretinitis and peripheral capillary non-perfusion, leading to irreversible visual loss. [Early treatment of idiopathic vasculitis, aneurysms and neuroretinitis (IRVAN). A case report]. CASE REPORT: A 55 year old woman presented with retinal vasculitis, multiple aneurysms, macular exudation and widespread retinal nonperfusion and was diagnosed with IRVAN. A 7-year-old girl with IRVAN (idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis) syndrome was monitored for 9 years. Vision loss associated with the idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome most commonly occurs from macular edema or complications related to neovascularization.  PURPOSE: To report a case of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome associated with positive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA). PURPOSE: We report our experience in treating 2 patients of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysm, and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome with antitumor necrosis factor agent, infliximab, who showed a very favorable response to treatment Fluorescein angiography delineated saccular aneurysms of the retinal arteriolar vasculature, and IRVAN syndrome was diagnosed.

5c641179e842deac67000012	What are the effects of STEF depletion?	The mechanisms regulating the actin cap are currently poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that STEF/TIAM2, a Rac1 selective guanine nucleotide exchange factor, localises at the nuclear envelope, co-localising with the key perinuclear proteins Nesprin-2G and Non-muscle myosin IIB (NMMIIB), where it regulates perinuclear Rac1 activity. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. STEF depletion drastically reduced dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. STEF depletion and Rac1-N17 expression reduced cAMP-induced TC10 inactivation.

Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. In addition, these phenotypes were associated with abnormal expression of three heart-chamber markers including cmlc2, amhc and vmhc, and abnormal expression of myogenic regulatory factors including myod and myog. These data suggest that Smyd3 plays an important role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle. We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. We find both smyd3 and setd7 are highly expressed within developing zebrafish heart and knock-down of these genes led to severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis without altering the expressions pattern of heart markers, including cmlc2, vmhc, and amhc. Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish. SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, and SMYD4 have been found to play critical roles in carcinogenesis and/or the development of heart and skeletal muscle.

Investigation of the effects of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan, a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy subjects. Macitentan is a potent, orally active, non-peptide antagonist of endothelin receptors with tissue-targeting properties, currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Interaction profile of macitentan, a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, in vitro. Macitentan is a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  This article highlights how the introduction of new compounds such as macitentan, riociguat and selexipag, which act on the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways, respectively, have the potential to further improve the prognosis for patients with PAH. Dual ETRA/ETRB blockade with macitentan (or the combination of the ETRA and ETRB antagonists BQ123 and BQ788) did not enhance antitumor immune cell recruitment.  The novel ERA macitentan has recently concluded testing in a Phase III morbidity/mortality clinical trial in PAH patients.  Given that the newest PAH drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently required.  The discovery of N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-[2-[(5-bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-4-pyrimidinyl]-N'-propylsulfamide (Macitentan), an orally active, potent dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Among these, compound 17 (macitentan, ACT-064992) emerged as particularly interesting as it is a potent inhibitor of ET(A) with significant affinity for the ET(B) receptor and shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and high in vivo efficacy in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats.  Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.  Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan soon available) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil).  The aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and its major metabolite (ACT-132577) on alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression, evaluated on dermal fibroblasts from healthy subjects and on dermal fibroblasts from lesional and non-lesional skin from sclerodermic patients.

We assessed the efficacy of macitentan, a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist, using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial. Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug. Promising candidates include tyrosine kinase antagonists (e.g. imatinib); soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (riociguat); an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag); and a tissue targeting endothelin receptor antagonist (macitentan). Pharmacokinetics of the novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. Efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology of macitentan in comparison to other endothelin receptor antagonists in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Endothelin (ET)-1 influences pathological changes via two ET receptor subtypes (ETA and ETB), to which it binds with high affinity.  Macitentan was developed by modifying the structure of bosentan in the search for an optimal dual ERA with improved efficacy and tolerability compared with other ERAs.  Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in humans. Macitentan is a tissue-targeting, dual endothelin receptor antagonist, currently under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Antivascular therapy for multidrug-resistant ovarian tumors by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. The nonselective endothelin type A and B receptor antagonists bosentan (100 nmol/L) and macitentan (30 nmol/L) alone relaxed endothelin-contracted rings by 30±5% and 24±3%, respectively.  Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension. This rise could largely be prevented with the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan (ΔBP: 12.3±1.5 mm Hg) and only mildly with Tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic (ΔBP: 25.9±2.3 mm Hg).  Promising study results for the treatment of IPF were published for the triple tyrosine kinase inhibitor intedanib, other drugs such as the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) macitentan are currently investigated in clinical trials.

Macitentan, a tissue-targeting endothelin receptor antagonist for the potential oral treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Macitentan (ACT-064992), under development by Actelion Ltd in collaboration with Japanese licensee Nippon Shinyaku Co Ltd, is an orally active, non-peptide dual endothelin (ET)(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Macitentan, because of its ability to target the tissues and to block both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors, is emerging as a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation.  Comparison of the dissolution and pharmacokinetic profiles of two galenical formulations of the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan. Macitentan (ACT-064992) is an orally active endothelin receptor antagonist.  Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting. Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors).  In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats.

56d2ac03f22319765a000004	Which ones are the ESKAPE organisms?	The aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes.  Multidrug resistance among the 'ESKAPE' organisms - encompassing Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. - is of particular concern because they are responsible for many serious infections in hospitals. Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). 'ESKAPE' (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acintobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed.

Multicluster Pcdh diversity is required for mouse olfactory neural circuit assembly. The vertebrate clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) cell surface proteins are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (Pcdhα, Pcdhβ, and Pcdhγ). Here, we show that all three gene clusters functionally cooperate to provide individual mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with the cell surface diversity required for their assembly into distinct glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Although deletion of individual Pcdh clusters had subtle phenotypic consequences, the loss of all three clusters (tricluster deletion) led to a severe axonal arborization defect and loss of self-avoidance.
