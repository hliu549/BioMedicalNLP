5a6d0b2db750ff445500002d	Which factors drive replisome disassembly during DNA replication termination and mitosis?	Using Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos and Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that the E3 ligase CUL-2LRR-1associates with the replisome and drives ubiquitylation and disassembly of CMG, together with the CDC-48 cofactors UFD-1 and NPL-4. Removal of CMG from chromatin in frog egg extracts requires CUL2 neddylation, and our data identify chromatin recruitment of CUL2LRR1as a key regulated step during DNA replication termination. Interestingly, however, CMG persists on chromatin until prophase in worms that lack CUL-2LRR-1, but is then removed by a mitotic pathway that requires the CDC-48 cofactor UBXN-3, orthologous to the human tumour suppressor FAF1.

58dcecf58acda34529000023	Which are the components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in eukaryotes?	 The first step of replication initiation is the assembly of pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Since 1973, four proteins, Cdc6/Cdc18, MCM, ORC and Cdt1, have been extensively studied and proved to be pre-RC components. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively.  In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1. The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). We have characterized the Plasmodium falciparum minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM) that plays a key role in the transition of pre-RC to the RC. Similar to other eukaryotes, the Plasmodium genome encodes six MCM subunits.  During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. ORC1 is an essential component of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) that licenses eukaryote DNA replication origins. In higher eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) component Cdt1 is the major regulator in licensing control for DNA replication. The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) We examined the mRNA expression of the components of pre-replication complex (Pre-RC), CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7 Replication initiation is a multi-step process involving many factors including ORC, Cdt1p, Mcm2-7p and other proteins that bind to replication origins to form a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Different components of the ORC complex and Cdc6 stimulated prereplicative complex (pre-RC) formation and replication initiation when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and recruited to plasmid DNA containing a tandem array of GAL4-binding sites. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. MCM2-7 is a key component of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC), which is loaded onto chromatin by the concerted action of origin recognition complex, Cdc6, and Cdt1. The pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) is formed at all potential origins of replication through the action of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm2-7 complex.

56c3326750c68dd41600000b	Which histone modifications are correlated with transcription elongation?	 This is accompanied by reductions in the level of H3K36 trimethylation, a posttranslational histone modification associated with efficient transcriptional elongation, and the number of full-length transcripts from these genes. Also like BUR kinase and the PAF complex, the Spt5 CTR is important for histone H2B K123 monoubiquitination and histone H3 K4 and K36 trimethylation during transcription elongation. A positive feedback loop links opposing functions of P-TEFb/Cdk9 and histone H2B ubiquitylation to regulate transcript elongation in fission yeas  Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3 We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We next analyzed isolated ZNF 3' exons using stably integrated episomes. Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. Overall, our results show and suggest that multiple H4, H2A, and H3 residues contribute to and form a Set2 docking/recognition site on the nucleosomal surface so that proper Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation, histone acetylation, and transcriptional elongation can occur. Sp3 depletion correlated with increased H3K36me3 and H2Bub1, two histone modifications associated with transcription elongation Using a SIR-regulated heat shock-inducible transgene, hsp82-2001, and a natural drug-inducible subtelomeric gene, YFR057w, as models we demonstrate that substantial transcriptional induction (&gt;200-fold) can occur in the context of restricted histone loss and negligible levels of H3K4 trimethylation, H3K36 trimethylation and H3K79 dimethylation, modifications commonly linked to transcription initiation and elongation Sp3 depletion correlated with increased H3K36me3 and H2Bub1, two histone modifications associated with transcription elongation.

The patients with SLE and SS had the greatest renal, peripheral vascular, and musculoskeletal damage (24, 19, 38% of patients, respectively) followed by the SLE group Observations from lupus centres worldwide revealed that the prevalence of damage occurring in the cardiovascular system in patients with SLE has increased over the past four decades. lupus-related organ damage involving the neuropsychiatric and renal systems also remains a major factor that limits survival improvement in patients with this disease. This Review discusses the pattern and trend of organ damage in patients with SLE worldwide, the potential serological and genetic mechanisms of organ damage, and the advances in research on potential tools for early detection of lupus-related organ damage, such as functional brain imaging techniques, measurement of endothelial function, identification of biomarkers from body fluids, and development of risk calculation models.  Patients with SLE treated with long-term belimumab plus SoC had a low incidence of organ damage accrual and no unexpected AEs. High-risk patients with pre-existing organ damage also had low accrual, suggesting a favorable effect on future damage development.

5311bf53e3eabad021000006	Which are the biotracers used for detection of Alzheimer's disease using PET?	(18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample. This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid Î² positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting)  is implicated in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (AÎ²) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects. High AÎ² dep g biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid deposition [imaged with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose metabolism (imaged with [(18)F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural atrophy (imaged by MRI). Recently we published the initial subset of imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. We now exte Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent AÎ² burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that AÎ²-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE T ol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging. The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance. We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects. By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls). In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights. The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI  disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several AÎ²-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied AÎ²-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between AÎ²-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of AÎ²-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing AÎ² content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition, is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E Îµ4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E Îµ4 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE Îµ4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than Îµ4- EMCI and Îµ4- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than Îµ4- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE Îµ4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than Îµ4- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data als sitron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for Î²-amyloid (AÎ²). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled AÎ² ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvidâ¢) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of AÎ². Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high AÎ² affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of AÎ² in the brain.

5a7636d39e632bc066000004	Which R packages have been developed for the discovery of mutational signatures in cancer?	signeR: an empirical Bayesian approach to mutational signature discovery. Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: signeR is implemented in R and Câ++, and is available as a R package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/signeR Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition.Results: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.Availability: All tools developed in this paper have been implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or "mutation signatures" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with "mixed-membership models" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.

5e36e093b5b409ea5300000f	List Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated during cytokinesis	The final event of the eukaryotic cell cycle is cytokinesis, when two new daughter cells are born. How the timing and execution of cytokinesis is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we show that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, together with upregulation of its counteracting phosphatase Cdc14, controls each of the sequential steps of cytokinesis, including furrow ingression, membrane resolution and cell separation in budding yeast. We use phosphoproteome analysis of mitotic exit to identify Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated at the time of cytokinesis. We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators.	[['Aip1'], ['Ede1'], ['Inn1']]

54fb5720d176fff445000002	Which transcription factors are known as the four (4) "Yamanaka factors" that have been used to create induced pluripotent stem cells  (iPSCs)?	The recently established reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka represents a valuable tool for future therapeutic applications. In particular, the mechanisms how the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) directly drive reprogramming and which additional components are involved are still not yet understood. Here we show that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4)-expressing EV can also reprogram adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) into pluripotency, yet at a very low efficiency. The CytoTuneâ¢-iPS Reprogramming Kit contains four SeV-based reprogramming vectors, each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (i.e., Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and are optimized for generating iPSCs from human somatic cells. Delivery of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc via integrating viral vectors has been widely employed to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from both normal and disease-specific somatic tissues, providing an invaluable resource for medical research and drug development. We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable. Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the application of Yamanaka factors (OSKM), but the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming remain poorly understood. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM).  Through the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc, human somatic cells can be converted to a pluripotent state, generating so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(1-4). We have shown the generation of transgene-free human iPSCs from patients with different lung diseases using a single excisable polycistronic lentiviral Stem Cell Cassette (STEMCCA) encoding the Yamanaka factors(6). These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are created by the reprogramming of somatic cells via overexpression of certain transcription factors, such as the originally described Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) iPSC production was first achieved by transducing, with the use of retroviral vectors, four specific transcription factors: Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OKSM), into primary cells in culture Takahashi and Yamanaka, (Cell 126(4):663-676, 2006)	[['Oct4', 'Oct 3/4'], ['Sox2'], ['Klf4'], ['c-Myc']]
5720a8da0fd6f91b68000010	Which could be some of the possible causes of hypersomnia?	Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In acute TBI, we recently found decreased CSF levels of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter Hypocretin levels 6 months after TBI were significantly lower in patients with post-traumatic EDS These results suggest that sleep-wake disturbances, particularly EDS, fatigue and hypersomnia are common after TBI, and significantly impair quality of life When sleepiness is excessive, undesirable, inappropriate or unexplained, it often indicates a clinical disorder that is generically termed hypersomnia. One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases We report on an 83 yr old man with hypersomnia and central sleep apnoea (CSA) One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea. In this article, the causes of hypersomnia are detailed following the conventional classification of hypersomnic syndromes: narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia, insufficient sleep syndrome, medication- and toxin-dependent sleepiness, hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders, hypersomnia associated with neurological disorders, posttraumatic hypersomnia, infection (with a special emphasis on the differences between bacterial and viral diseases compared with parasitic diseases, such as sleeping sickness) and hypersomnia, hypersomnia associated with metabolic or endocrine diseases, breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep apnea syndromes, and periodic limb movements in sleep. In the absence of sleep deprivation (either because of behavioral or medical causes) or pharmacologically induced sleepiness, hypersomnia is a manifestation of one of the central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, and recurrent hypersomnias such as Kleine-Levin syndrome. Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), narcolepsy, chronic sleep deprivation (insufficiency), and restless legs/periodic limb movements in sleep syndrome (RLS/PLMS) represent the most common causes of hypersomnia. Hypocretin (orexin) deficiency in narcolepsy and primary hypersomnia. One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea.	[['traumatic brain injury (TBI)'], ['sleep apnea'], ['dementia']]

5a736efc3b9d13c708000006	Which chromosomes are implicated in the Emanuel syndrome?	Singleânucleotide polymorphismâarray analysis of the proband indicated a partial duplication of chromosomes 22 and 11 at 22q11.1âq11.21 and 11q23.3âq25, respectively, which confirmed the diagnosis of ES. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11).  Emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome, which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22.  Multiple congenital anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphism are characterizing the so-called Emanuel or supernumerary der(22)t(11;22) syndrome (OMIM609029).  Complex sSMCs consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome, for example, the derivative der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) in Emanuel syndrome. A case with Emanuel syndrome: extra derivative 22 chromosome inherited from the mother.  Affected children are usually identified in the newborn period as the offspring of balanced (11;22) translocation carriers. We report a 3-year-old boy with the t(11;22)(q23;q11) chromosome, transmitted in an unbalanced fashion from his mother.  Balanced carriers of t(11;22) usually manifest no clinical symptoms, and are often identified after the birth of offspring with an unbalanced form of this translocation, known as Emanuel syndrome.  Derivative 11;22 (emanuel) syndrome: a case report and a review. Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome.  The syndrome is caused by chromosomal imbalance due to a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22.  We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X [Turner syndrome (TS)], trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests.  Emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3:1 meiotic segregation from parental balanced translocation carrier t(11;22)(q23;q11), mostly of maternal origin.  Here in, we describe a female patient with supernumerary der(22) syndrome (Emanuel syndrome) due to balanced translocation carrier father t(11;22) (q23;q11).  The t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) is the main recurrent germline translocation in humans. Unbalanced translocation can be transmitted to the progeny and can cause Emanuel syndrome. Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) constitute one of the smallest subsets within the patients with an sSMC. Complex sSMCs consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome, for example, the derivative der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) in Emanuel syndrome. Emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome, which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. Emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3:1 meiotic segregation from parental balanced translocation carrier t(11;22)(q23;q11), mostly of maternal origin. Emanuel syndrome results from +der(22)t(11q23;22q11).

chromosomal disorder characterized by severe mental retardation and multiple anomalies the syndrome is caused by chromosomal imbalance due to a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22 little is known regarding the characteristics of prenatal biochemical screening or ultrasonographic markers in this syndrome we aimed to identify a prenatal screening pattern characteristic of emanuel syndrome we report the prenatal characteristics of five fetuses with emanuel syndrome four of which were diagnosed prenatally we found no consistent pattern of prenatal biochemical markers or other prenatal characteristics nevertheless increased nt low papp a and ultrasound features such as intra uterine growth restriction posterior fossa cardiac and bowel abnormalities may be helpful in raising the suspicion for this rare genetic syndrome review of the biochemical screening results ultrasound findings and demographic characteristics of this emanuel syndrome case series as well as of the relevant literature fail to suggest a characteristic prenatal pattern. emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22 the frequency of this syndrome has been reported as 1 in 110 000 it is a rare anomaly associated with multiple systemic malformations such as micrognathia and congenital heart disease in addition patients with emanuel syndrome may have seizure disorders we experienced anesthetic management of a patient with emanuel syndrome who underwent palatoplasty this patient had received tracheotomy due to micrognathia in addition he had atrial septal defect mild pulmonary artery stenosis and cleft palate palatoplasty was performed without any complication during anesthesia close attention was directed to cardiac function seizure and airway management. complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes ssmc constitute one of the smallest subgroups of ssmc in general complex ssmc consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 der 22 t 11 22 or emanuel syndrome in 2008 we speculated that complex ssmc could be part of an underestimated entity here the overall yet reported 412 complex ssmc are summarized they constitute 8 4 of all yet in detail characterized ssmc cases the majority of the complex ssmc is contributed by patients suffering from emanuel syndrome 82 besides there are a der 22 t 8 22 q24 1 q11 1 and a der 13 t 13 18 q11 p11 21 or der 21 t 18 21 p11 21 q11 1 der 13 or 21 t 13 or 21

nonetheless complex ssmc can involve material from each chromosomal origin most complex ssmc are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non mosaic interestingly there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved complex ssmc need to be considered in diagnostics especially in non mosaic centric minute shaped ssmc as yet three complex ssmc associated syndromes are identified as recurrent breakpoints in the complex ssmc were characterized it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of ssmc overall complex ssmc emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation. emanuel syndrome is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and developmental disability it is caused by the presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome that contains material from chromosomes 11 and 22 the origin of this imbalance is 3 1 malsegregation of a parental balanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 which is the most common recurrent reciprocal translocation in humans little has been published on the clinical features of this syndrome since the 1980s and information on natural history is limited we designed a questionnaire to collect information from families recruited through an international online support group chromosome 22 central data gathered include information on congenital anomalies medical and surgical history developmental and behavioral issues and current abilities we received information on 63 individuals with emanuel syndrome ranging in age from newborn to adulthood as previously recognized congenital anomalies were common the most frequent being ear pits 76 micrognathia 60 heart malformations 57 and cleft palate 54 our data suggest that vision and hearing impairment seizures failure to thrive and recurrent infections particularly otitis media are common in this syndrome psychomotor development is uniformly delayed however the majority of individuals over 70 eventually learn to walk with support language development and ability for self care are also very impaired this study provides new information on the clinical spectrum and natural history of emanuel syndrome for families and physicians caring for these individuals. emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3 1

58adca6d9ef3c34033000007	Which proteins control the degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in yeast?	Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene.  These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises â¼ 1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome. The Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex in S. cerevisiae is a nuclear exosome cofactor that recruits the exosome to degrade RNAs  The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has only a minor role in this process The eukaryotic exosome exoribonuclease Rrp6 forms a complex with Rrp47 that functions in nuclear RNA quality control mechanisms, the degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and in the 3 end maturation of stable RNAs Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation Genome-wide studies have identified abundant small, noncoding RNAs, including small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and upstream regulatory RNAs (uRNAs), that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) and terminated by an Nrd1-dependent pathway Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.

5a760e5583b0d9ea66000018	Which comparisons demonstrate the applicability of StereoGene in regulatory genomics?	StereoGene: rapid estimation of genome-wide correlation of continuous or interval feature data. Genomics features with similar genome-wide distributions are generally hypothesized to be functionally related, for example, colocalization of histones and transcription start sites indicate chromatin regulation of transcription factor activity. Therefore, statistical algorithms to perform spatial, genome-wide correlation among genomic features are required.Results: Here, we propose a method, StereoGene, that rapidly estimates genome-wide correlation among pairs of genomic features. These features may represent high-throughput data mapped to reference genome or sets of genomic annotations in that reference genome. StereoGene enables correlation of continuous data directly, avoiding the data binarization and subsequent data loss. Correlations are computed among neighboring genomic positions using kernel correlation. Representing the correlation as a function of the genome position, StereoGene outputs the local correlation track as part of the analysis. StereoGene also accounts for confounders such as input DNA by partial correlation. We apply our method to numerous comparisons of ChIP-Seq datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE to demonstrate its wide applicability. We observe the changes in the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types consistent with known biology and find a novel spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with donor splice sites and with poly(A) sites. These analyses provide examples for the broad applicability of StereoGene for regulatory genomics.

In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo.

We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes.

5311b99ae3eabad021000004	Which medical diagnostic tests are used to test kidney function?	kidney dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are diagnosed by the evaluation of changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations.  Renal biomarkers, especially those present in urine, may be useful for the study of both acute and chronic nephropathies. The International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) canine AKI grading system and the implementation of urinary biomarkers Decreased tryptophan (TRP) and increased kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in blood have been reported in patients and experimental animals with renal diseases. Acute kidney injury was defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50% or more from the beginning of vancomycin therapy.   In critically ill children, the development of reversible AKI during vancomycin therapy is associated with administration of nephrotoxic drugs and an elevated BUN: Scr ratio. The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR. After kidney donation, renal function measured by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine of all donors returned to normal within one week, and no serious complications were noticed.  In living kidney donors GFR is not significantly correlated with age or sex. Increased proteinuria would lead to a larger risk for renal failure in the long term A reduction of proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease was observed during the 4-month treatment with pioglitazone which continued for 2 months after the cessation of the treatment. However, 4 months after the cessation of the treatment, a little increase was detected in the level of proteinuria. We identify pleiotropic associations among these loci with kidney function-related traits and risk of CKD.

517843638ed59a060a000036	What are the major classes of retrotransposons active in the human genome?	Half of the human genome is composed of repeated DNA, and some types are mobile within our genome (transposons and retrotransposons). Despite their abundance, only a small fraction of them are currently active in our genome (Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1), Alu, and SVA elements). Since certain types of retrotransposons, particularly members of the Alu, L1, and SVA families, are still active, their recent and ongoing propagation generates a unique and important class of human genomic diversity/polymorphism Alu elements are the most successful SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) in primate genomes and have reached more than 1,000,000 copies in the human genome 1 and Alu represent the most prolific human LINE and SINE families, respectively.

56c830635795f9a73e00000e	Which components of the stress granules are known to be related to motor neuron degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?	Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as a key protein in the pathogenesis of some cases of ALS. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients.  in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. These findings demonstrate a potential link between FUS mutations and cellular pathways involved in stress responses that may be relevant to altered motor neuron homeostasis in ALS. both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43. These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms abnormal ubiquitinated and phosphorylated inclusions in brain tissues from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA binding protein, have been associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness and has overlapping clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response. Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder consisting of progressive loss of motor neurons. TDP-43 has been identified as a component of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions of motor neurons in ALS. SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) PTE significantly reduced the incorporation of R521C FUS/TLS into stress granules under stress conditions.

532c0d7fd6d3ac6a3400001c	List programs suitable for pharmacophore modelling	Pharmacophore models based on thermolysin binding modes and activity profiles were generated using the LigandScout program In this study, pharmacophore hypotheses based on known inhibitors were generated using common feature pharmacophore generation protocol available in Discovery Studio program  A pharmacophore-based screening was then carried out using the program Catalyst The PharmaGist employed algorithm to identify the best pharmacophores by computing multiple flexible alignments between the input ligands. The multiple alignments are generated by combining alignments pair-wise between one of the gliptin input ligands, which acts as pivot and the other gliptin as ligand. The resulting multiple alignments reveal spatial arrangements of consensus features shared by different subsets of input ligands. The best pharmacophore model has been derived using both pair-wise and multiple alignment methods, which have been weighted in Pharmacophore Generation process Pharmacophore models of c-Met kinase inhibitors have been developed based on 22 diverse compounds by using HypoGen algorithm implemented in Discovery studio program package. chemical feature based pharmacophore models of MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13 inhibitors have been developed with the aid of HypoGen module within Catalyst program package Genetic Algorithm Similarity Program (GASP) was used to derive a 3D pharmacophore model which was used in effective alignment of data set. Active site complimenting structure-based pharmacophore models were developed using Discovery Studio 2.5 program and validated using a dataset of known HDAC8 inhibitors.   pharmacophore model has been generated from the training set by means of the MOE (molecular operating environment) program. A training set of 20 compounds with known experimental activity was used to generate pharmacophore hypotheses using 3D QSAR Pharmacophore Generation module available in Discovery studio.

52bf1dea03868f1b06000012	What are the side effects of Nalmefene?	Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Side effects to nalmefene were of greater duration and intensity in the subjects receiving 10 mg of nalmefene vs. those receiving 6 or 2 mg. These included most notably fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting. The nalmefene treated group ate 22% less, both in terms of absolute weight and caloric intake, of a standardised buffet-meal than did the placebo group.  Thus the apparent nutrient specificity of nalmefene appeared to be an indirect consequence of its effect on palatability. Nalmefene also caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for observed changes in eating behaviour. In the second study, six healthy men were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours. A dosing schedule of 20 mg q12h was then started and continued for seven days. Plasma samples were collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day administration period.  In the first study, single ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg of nalmefene HCl were administered in double-blind fashion to four groups of healthy men. There were six subjects in each group; four received nalmefene and two received placebo. The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, such as lightheadedness, at the higher doses.  Doses of nalmefene as large as 0.4 mg/kg, IV, produced only minor side effects. These side effects included some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and mild sedation. Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden. Sedation wore off during the course of prolonged infusions.  The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness.

531376c8e3eabad021000012	which mutations of phospholamban gene have been found to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	one L39X nonsense mutation was identified in 1 of 1,064 HCM proband cases with a family history of HCM, previously found to be negative for the current HCM genetic test panel. This mutation cosegregated with incidence of HCM in a multigenerational family. The PLN -42 C>G mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  The PLN -42 C>G mutation is associated with a benign form of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this family, though the presence of a healthy adult carrier suggests that other genetic and environmental factors could be involved.  We found a heterozygous single nucleotide transition from A to G at -77-bp upstream of the transcription start site in the phospholamban promoter region of one patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the mutation, -77A-->G, increased the phospholamban promoter activity. No nucleotide change in the phospholamban coding region was found in 99 patients with cardiomyopathy. We suspect that the mutation plays an important role in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter).

57169b63cb4ef8864c00000b	Which are the human glutamate transporters?	The density of EAAC1 (EAAT3) glutamate transporters expressed by neurons in the mammalian CNS. Glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) are the most abundant subtypes and are essential for the functioning of the mammalian CNS, but the contribution of the EAAC1 subtype in the clearance of synaptic glutamate has remained controversial, because the density of this transporter in different tissues has not been determined. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral.  Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST. In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites. Reticulon RTN2B regulates trafficking and function of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1. Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when induced Here we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determined Reduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (<10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transporters Position of the third Na+ site in the aspartate transporter GltPh and the human glutamate transporter, EAAT1. We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP. Glutamate receptors and transporters, including T1R1 and T1R3 (taste receptor 1, subtypes 1 and 3), mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors), EAAC-1 (excitatory amino acid carrier-1), GLAST-1 (glutamate-aspartate transporter-1), and GLT-1 (glutamate transporter-1), are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract The ASCTs (alanine, serine, and cysteine transporters) belong to the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1), which also includes the human glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPh As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST) GLT-1, Glutamate Transporter 1, same as excitatory amino acid transporter 2; Glu, glutamate Multiple Functions of Glutamate Uptake via Meningococcal GltT-GltM l-Glutamate ABC Transporter in Neisseria meningitidis Internalization into Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between family members, ASCTs function quite differently from the EAATs and GltPh.  First, Li(+) cannot support transport by EAAT2, whereas it can support transport by the other excitatory amino acid transporters, and second, EAAT2 is sensitive to a wider range of blockers than other subtypes.  hGLT-1 and hGLuT-1 mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the brain, while hEAAC1 mRNA expression (3.8 kb and 2,4 kb) was strongest in peripheral organs.  Identification of functional domains of the human glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 is different from other subtypes in two respects.  DNA methylation dependent silencing of the human glutamate transporter EAAT2 gene in glial cells. We have investigated the functional impact of a naturally occurring mutation of the human glutamate transporter GLT1 (EAAT2), which had been detected in a patient with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP. Using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analysis of concatenated transporters, and chemical cross-linking, we demonstrated that human and prokaryotic glutamate transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or in mammalian cells are assembled as trimers composed of three identical subunits. Five glutamate transporters in the human brain (EAAT1-5) are present on both astroglia and neurons. We characterize the profile of three different human astroglial progenitors in vitro: human glial restricted precursors (HGRP), human astrocyte precursors (HAPC), and early-differentiated astrocytes. They are known to be multimers; however, the number of subunits forming a functional transporter is controversial.

589dee3778275d0c4a000050	What genes are drug targets for Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)?	 Recently, FOP has been associated with a specific mutation of ACVR1, the gene coding for a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor.  Small molecule inhibitors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor kinase ALK2 (ACVR1) are needed urgently to treat the progressively debilitating musculoskeletal disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Dorsomorphin analogues, first identified in zebrafish, remain the only BMP inhibitor chemotype reported to date. By screening an assay panel of 250 recombinant human kinases we identified a highly selective 2-aminopyridine-based inhibitor K02288 with in vitro activity against ALK2 at low nanomolar concentrations similar to the current lead compound LDN-193189 Here, it is noted that if B cells are found to be the lymphocytes responsible for excess BMP-4 production in FOP, use of Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which effectively targets B cells, could be a less permanent and less risky treatment alternative for FOP.

These mutations represent new targets for therapeutic intervention in this otherwise incurable disease. In this study, we examined downstream signaling targets to study the BMP-Smad and BMP-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in FOP.

Linkage exclusion and mutational analysis of the noggin gene in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disorder characterized by progressive ossification of connective tissue, is caused by an activating mutation in Acvr1 (the gene that encodes ACVR1/ALK2). This gene encodes the type I bone morphogenic protein receptor ALK2, with the residues affected identical to those that, when mutated in the germline, give rise to the congenital malformation syndrome fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), resulting in the transformation of soft tissue into bone.

54db7217c4c6ce8e1d000003	How many and which are the different isoforms for the ryanodine receptor?	Skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac muscle (RyR2) isoforms of ryanodine receptor calcium channels Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are located in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum membrane and are responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores during excitation-contraction coupling in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. RyRs are the largest known ion channels (> 2MDa) and exist as three mammalian isoforms (RyR 1-3), Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of intracellular calcium release channels that mediate calcium-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Among the three RyR isoforms, RyR3 is preferentially expressed in the brain especially in the hippocampus and striatum. In excitable cells such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes excitation-contraction coupling is an important intermediate step between initiation of the action potential and induction of contraction. This process is predominantly controlled by Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor. This very large protein (MW 560 kDa) exists as a homotetramer (~2.2 MDa) and is expressed in three isoforms: RyR1, expressed in skeletal muscle; RyR2, expressed in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, expressed in various cells at lower levels than the other isoforms.  Generally, three ryanodine receptor isoforms (RyR1-RyR3) are known;  Ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a Ca(2+) channel that mediates Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. There are three RyR isoforms, Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular Ca(2+) channels that mediate the release of calcium from internal stores and therefore play an important role in Ca(2+) signaling and homeostasis. Three RyR isoforms have been described thus far, RyR1 and RyR2 RyR3 Three different isoforms of the SR Ca2+ release channels, or ryanodine receptors (RyRs), have been isolated (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3).

Remarkably, in mammalian somatic cells, H3S10P initiates in the pericentromeric heterochromatin during the late G2 phase, and phosphorylation spreads throughout the chromosomes arms in prophase, being maintained until the onset of anaphase when it gets dephosphorylated Based on these findings, we believe that H3S10P is a good marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin, especially in the late 1- and 2-cell stages as it labels both parental genomes and that it can be used to further investigate epigenetic regulation and heterochromatin mechanisms in early preimplantation embryos 3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3 We show that H3K36me3 deposition within this large heterochromatin domain does not correlate with transcription events, suggesting the existence of an alternative pathway for the deposition of this histone modification In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts This result indicates that H3K36me3 is associated with both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin Our data suggest that H3K36me3 function is not restricted to actively transcribed regions only and may contribute to the composition of heterochromatin, in combination with other histone modifications. accumulation of histone H3.3 and euchromatic histone modifications in pericentromeric heterochromatin in response to a decrease in DNA methylation levels In this study, we show that inhibition of DNA methylation in mouse fibroblast cells affects histone modification and the subnuclear localization of histone H3.3 in a cell cycle-dependent manner Moreover, we found that histone H3.3 was deposited on the pericentromeric heterochromatin prior to the accumulation of the euchromatic histone modifications Classical histone modifications associated with heterochromatin, including H3K9me2, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2, were distributed throughout both A and B chromosomes However, H3K27me2 showed a reduced level on the B chromosome compared with the A chromosomes and was not associated with some classes of constitutive heterochromatin Recently analyzed H3K9 methyltransferases (HMTases) as SUV39H1, Clr4p, DIM-5, Su(var)3-9 or SUVH2 are responsible for the establishment of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), which is intimately connected with heterochromatinization heterochromatic histone H3K9 methyltransferases left its marks behind Compilation and parsimony analysis reveal that histone H3K9 methylation is, next to histone deacetylation, the evolutionary most stable heterochromatic mark, which is established by at least two subfamilies of specialized heterochromatic HMTases in almost all studied eukaryote Trimethylated H3(K9) marks pericentromeric constitutive heterochromatin and the male Y chromosome, while H2A.Z is dramatically reduced at these chromosomal locations Of eight tested antibodies, the one for histone H4 acetylated at lysine 4, 8, 12, or 16 was best for distinguishing constitutive heterochromatin from unexpressed euchromatin, but differences in the extent of immunoprecipitation of these two types of chromatin were only modest, although highly reproducible In addition, immunocytochemical analysis was done with an antibody to heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), whose preferential binding to heterochromatin has been linked to trimethylation of H3 at lysine 9 Our combined ChIP and immunocytochemical results suggest that factors other than hypoacetylation of the N-terminal tails of H4 and hypermethylation of H3 at lysine 9 can play an important role in determining whether a chromatin sequence in mammalian cells is constitutively heterochromatic To test for the putative heterochromatinization, we quantitated chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody for acetylated histone H4 that discriminates between constitutive heterochromatin and unexpressed euchromatin high methylation of H3 lysine 9 is dispensable for constitutive heterochromatin Strong methylation at H3 lysine 4 was restricted to euchromatin, while strong methylation at H3 lysine 9 occurred preferentially in heterochromatic chromocenters of Arabidopsis nuclei	[['H3K9Me1', 'H3K9Me2', 'H3K9me3', 'H3K9 trimethylation'], ['H3K27me1'], ['H3K27me2'], ['H4K20me3', 'H4K20 trimethylation'], ['H3K79me3', 'H3K79 methylation'], ['H3S10', 'H3S10 phosphorylation']]
516c0ebc298dcd4e5100006e	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?	our data suggests that TRbeta1-mediated down regulation of hepatic LDLr gene may play a critical role in iodine excess-induced hypercholesterolemic effects. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. However, the T3-activated expression of the GH gene in GH3-PV and ME gene in SK-Hep-1-PV was repressed by approximately 30% and 90%, respectively, indicating the lack of correlation of PV/TRpbeta1 protein ratio with the dominant negative potency of mutant PV. Transient cotransfection of P450R promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs and the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TR beta1) expression plasmid into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells resulted in a 2.4-fold induction of promoter activity that was both T3 and TR beta1 dependent. At the molecular level, we detected a dose-dependent attenuation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) expression in parallel to the change of serum cholesterol.

58a0c09778275d0c4a000052	What are the different classes of orally administered drugs used to treat diabetes	 achieved by selectively inhibiting sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). After a decade-long effort to improve the pharmacokinetics of GLP1, a number of GLP1 analogues are currently available on the market  short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists exenatide and lixisenatide.   Sulphonylurea (SU) drugs have a history stretching back over 60 years, and have traditionally been the mainstay choice as second-line agents to be added to metformin once glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy deteriorates; In 2013, sulfonylureas were the most common second-line treatment after metformin i this position was taken by DPP-4 inhibitors [Studies on resorption of orally administered antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents in children and its modification. The drugs used to treat diabetes mellitus are diverse and include several classes. Many of the therapeutic agents used to treat diabetes mellitus have the ability to lower blood glucose to dangerous concentrations; these include the sulfonylurea, meglitinide, and thiazolidinedione drug classes. The most common therapeutic classes of drugs used in all participating regions, in the previous week, were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, metabolic (including drugs to treat diabetes) and nervous system. Use of oral antidiabetic agents, by drug class, did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity (p = 0.33 for TZDs, p = 0.43 for metformin, p = 0.38 for sulfonylureas).  The use of these drugs was also common among insulin treated diabetics but did not differ significantly from among non-diabetics.  Drug use among those treated with insulin and those treated orally was substantially higher than among non-diabetics while the difference between diabetics on dietary regimen and non-diabetics was much smaller.  UNLABELLED: The aims of the study were to evaluate differences in dietary, oral hygiene habits and social class in children with Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), compared to non-diabetics, and to investigate relationship between selected caries-risk factors and caries experience in diabetics.  Vildagliptin is a potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4), orally active, that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) primarily by enhancing pancreatic (alpha and beta) islet function. The literature covered includes original studies and meta-analyses identified in PubMed, recent abstracts presented at major diabetes scientific conferences, and clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.Although there are some differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the different DPP-4 inhibitors, all are small orally active compounds with broadly similar HbA1c-lowering efficacy. The authors conclude that rosiglitazone can be safely administered with metformin and, due to the different mechanisms of action of these agents, may offer a therapeutic advantage in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs reported to treat diabetes. There are now four different classes of oral medications which are available to treat diabetes-sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. During followup, incident treated diabetes was defined as a self-report of a new physician diagnosis of diabetes treated with insulin or oral drugs. This systematic review will compare adherence and persistence rates across the different classes of medication available to people with type 2 diabetes. Five classes of oral hypoglycaemic drugs and two trace minerals used to treat diabetes mellitus in humans are reviewed and current knowledge on the use of these drugs in diabetic dogs and cats is presented. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. Currently, four classes of orally administered antidiabetic agents are available for use in patients with type 2 diabetes: insulin secretagogues, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones.

58dbb3f18acda34529000019	Which are the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors that are FDA approved?	Inhibition of the PCSK9 protein by monoclonal antibodies results in a dramatic 40%-60% lowering of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).  Alirocumab and evolocumab have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) who do not achieve their LDL-C target on maximal tolerated statin treatment and dietary modification. In addition, evolocumab has been approved by the FDA for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. LDL cholesterol (LDLC) lowering has been revolutionized by PCSK9 inhibitors, Alirocumab (Praluent) and Evolocumab (Repatha), approved as adjuncts to maximally tolerated cholesterol lowering therapy in heterozygous (HeFH) or homozygous (HoFH) familial hypercholesterolemia, and/or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) where LDLC lowering is insufficient. A new class of lipid-lowering drugs, inhibitors of PCSK9 has been generating impressive clinical trial data over the last several years, and alirocumab (Praluent) has become the first to be approved by the US FDA. The second FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab (Repatha) appears to be similar in efficacy and safety to alirocumab (Praluent), but no comparative studies are available.  Two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, have recently been approved by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Newer agents for LDL cholesterol reduction include the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide, the apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotide mipomersen and several molecules that inhibit or interfere with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9).Among the various PCSK9 inhibitors, human data are available for monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 of which the two most advanced are alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) and AMG 145 The 2 or 4âweek subcutaneous therapy with the recently approved antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab for inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in addition to statins and ezetimibe by 50-60â%. In 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, alirocumab (PraluentÂ®; Sanofi/ Regeneron) and evolocumab (RepathaÂ®; Amgen), for use in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients intolerant of statins or those with a major risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but unable to lower their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to optimal levels with statins and ezetimibe. Very recent clinical trials have proven overwhelmingly the effectiveness and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for lowering LDL-C. Both alirocumab and evolocumab have now been approved by the US FDA and there are some initial favorable outcomes data. Food and Drug Administration approved the first two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, alirocumab (PraluentÂ®; Sanofi/ Regeneron) and evolocumab (RepathaÂ®; Amgen), for use in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients intolerant of statins or those with a major risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but unable to lower their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to optimal levels with statins and ezetimibe.

56d042ae3975bb303a00000d	When ceritinib used instead of crizotinib?	Ceritinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in crizotinib-resistant patients, becoming a promising treatment option in this population.  Ceritinib is approved for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in patients who are intolerant to or have progressed despite therapy with crizotinib.  Ceritinib has activity in crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-naÃ¯ve patients and appears to be a viable alternative for ALK-positive NSCLC. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also presented. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. Preclinical data showed impressive antitumor activity against crizotinib-resistant clones, and based on available data, ceritinib could represent a suitable option in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC.

However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.

5179602c8ed59a060a00003d	What are the effects of ILK ablation?	ILK knockdown had no effect on the viability or survival pathway activity pattern of MM cells. We conclude that ILK does not play a prominent role in the promotion or sustenance of established MM. Defective granulation tissue formation in mice with specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in fibroblasts Here, we show that fibroblast-restricted inactivation of ILK in mice leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts, whereas inflammatory infiltrate and vascularization of the granulation tissue are unaffected. in fibroblasts, ILK is crucial for limiting RhoA activity, thus promoting TGFÎ²1 production, which is essential for dermal repair following injury. Our results show that ILK is important for the function, but not the differentiation, of osteoclasts. Osteoclast-specific inactivation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) inhibits bone resorption. ack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB. Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration. Enhanced liver regeneration following changes induced by hepatocyte-specific genetic ablation of integrin-linked kinase. ILK deficiency caused an aberrant distribution of nephrin and alpha-actinin-4 in podocytes, whereas the localization of podocin and synaptopodin remained relatively intact. Targeted ablation of ILK from the murine heart results in dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous heart failure. Here we show that targeted ablation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression results in spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by 6 wk of age. Together, these results suggest that ILK plays a central role in protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure. Our results show for the first time in vivo the significance of ILK and hepatic ECM-signaling for regulation of hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation. Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in abnormal histology, enhanced cell proliferation, and hepatomegaly.

54f21b69c409818c32000007	Which disorders are associated to mutated Hepcidin (HAMP)?	juvenile hemochromatosis due to hemojuvelin and hepcidin mutation  Mutations in all of the currently known genes implicated in non-HFE HH (hemojuvelin, hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, and ferroportin) have been reported in patients from the Asia-Pacific region.  In conclusion, HAMP and hemojuvelin mutations are rare among Spanish HH patients, and their impact in this population is not significant. Juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is the most severe form, usually caused by mutations in hemojuvelin (HJV) or hepcidin (HAMP).  We have identified novel mutations in HJV, HAMP, and SLC40A1 in countries not normally associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Thailand). In humans, loss of TfR2, HJV, and hepcidin itself or FPN mutations result in full-blown hemochromatosis.  Targeting hepcidin with replacement therapy to decrease iron may be a treatment of not only HCV, HH, and alcoholic cirrhosis, but also PCT. Hepcidin deficiency underlies iron overload in HFE-hemochromatosis as well as in several other genetic iron excess disorders, such as hemojuvelin or hepcidin-related hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor 2-related hemochromatosis.  In addition to HFE gene, mutations in the genes that encode hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1) have been associated with regulation of iron homeostasis and development of HH	[['juvenile hemochromatosis']]
5c72a9147c78d6947100006e	Which drugs are included in the Lonsurf pill?	The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Servier, the company manufacturing trifluridine and tipiracil (T/T; trade name: LonsurfÂ®), to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T compared with best supportive care (BSC) for metastatic colorectal cancer (third-line or later).  PURPOSE: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; TAS-102, LonsurfÂ®), a novel form of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), has shown clinical benefit in the global, phase III RECOURSE trial, regardless of patient age.  BACKGROUND: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, LonsurfÂ®), a novel oral anti-tumor agent combining an anti-neoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue (trifluridine, FTD) with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (tipiracil hydrochloride, TPI) presents a new treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.  These AEs may affect patient adherence, particularly with completely oral regimens, such as trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, LonsurfÂ®), an antimetabolite agent for patients with mCRC refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.â© Trifluridine/tipiracil has recently been approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are refractory to or are not considered candidates for, current standard chemotherapy and biological therapy in the EU and USA and in unresectable advanced or recurrent CRC in Japan.  TAS-102 (Lonsurf) is an oral fluoropyrimidine that is formed by the combination of 2 active drugs: trifluridine (a nucleoside analog) and tipiracil hydrochloride (a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor).

5149199dd24251bc05000040	Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?	Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. For more than 50 years the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide has been the drug of choice in the symptomatic therapy for myasthenia gravis.  The switch to SR-Pyr ameliorated the total quantified myasthenia gravis (QMG) score from 0.9 Â± 0.5 to 0.6 Â± 0.4 (p<0.001) in all patients and in the younger subgroup. This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the quality of life parameters. The health status valued by EuroQoL questionnaire improved from 0.626 Â± 0.286 to 0.782 Â± 0.186 (p<0.001).  Our results support the usefulness of SR-Pyr in an individualized therapeutic regimen to improve quality of life regardless of the patient's age in myasthenia gravis. This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine. Despite a lack of data from well controlled clinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine is the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG.  Novel AChE inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and preliminary results appear to be promising. Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no randomised controlled trial has been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in the placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify.  Current guidelines and recommendations for MG treatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying treatments. Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary, symptomatic treatment for all forms of myasthenia gravis. 	[['neostigmine'], ['pyridostigmine']]
58a7fb2860087bc10a000034	Which mutated genes are associated with the Tourette's syndrome?	 A rare genetic form of Tourette syndrome due to L-histidine-decarboxylase mutation, with similar features in human and rodent, has inspired new research on functional anatomy of Tourette syndrome. A mutation in histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of histamine (HA), has been implicated as a rare genetic cause. Histidine decarboxylase deficiency causes tourette syndrome: parallel findings in humans and mice. Tourette syndrome (TS), the most severe end of the continuum of tic disorders, is substantially genetic, but causative mutations have been elusive. The SLITRK1 gene encodes a developmentally regulated stimulator of neurite outgrowth and previous studies have implicated rare variants in this gene in disorders in the OC spectrum, specifically Tourette syndrome (TS) The recent implication of the histamine decarboxylase (HDC) gene, the key enzyme in histamine production, raises the intriguing hypothesis of a possible role of histaminergic dysfunction leading to TS onset. we describe an analysis of linkage in a two-generation pedigree leading to the identification of a rare functional mutation in the HDC gene encoding L-histidine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in histamine biosynthesis. Mutations in the gene SLITRK1 (Slit and Trk-like 1) have been reported in patients with Tourette's disorder (TD) Recently, two variants, including a single-base deletion resulting in a truncated protein and a 3'-untranslated-region variant altering a binding site for micro-RNA in the Slit and Trk-like 1 gene, were found to be a genetic cause of Tourette syndrome. Collectively, these findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS.	[['histidine decarboxylase', 'Hdc'], ['Slit and Trk-like 1', 'SLITRK1']]

Changes in the nucleolar and coiled body compartments precede lamina and chromatin reorganization during fibre cell denucleation in the bovine lens Prior to chromatin condensation, coilin redistributed to the nucleolar compartment and was absent from nuclei where chromatin had begun to condense. These constraints reflect the physical attachment of chromatin to nuclear compartments or steric impairment caused by local ultrastructure A number of these proteins accumulate in viral replication compartments in the infected cell nucleus, indicating that these proteins may have a role in viral replication.  Nuclear marginalization of host cell chromatin associated with expansion of two discrete virus-induced subnuclear compartments during baculovirus infection In the late stage of infection, however, the peristromal region (PR), another virus-induced subnuclear compartment, was also excluded from the chromatin-localizing area. This correlation between compartmentalization and chromatin exclusion suggests the possibility that a chromatin-exclusive property of viral molecules, at least in part, supports nuclear compartmentalization of virus-infected cells. Chromatin modifications in hematopoietic multipotent and committed progenitors are independent of gene subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartments To further clarify the contribution of nuclear architecture in the regulation of gene expression patterns during differentiation of human multipotent cells, we analyzed expression status, histone modifications, and subnuclear positioning relative to repressive compartments, of hematopoietic loci in multipotent and lineage-committed primary human hematopoietic progenitors. We report here that positioning of lineage-affiliated loci relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin compartments (PCH) is identical in multipotent cells from various origins and is unchanged between multipotent and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors.  The complexity in composition and function of the eukaryotic nucleus is achieved through its organization in specialized nuclear compartments. Cohesin-based chromatin interactions enable regulated gene expression within preexisting architectural compartments. Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown that interphase chromatin is partitioned into spatially segregated Mb-sized compartments and sub-Mb-sized topological domains. This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the matching of genes and regulatory elements, we find that architectural compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic depletion of cohesin in vivo Our findings indicate that cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression states within preexisting chromosomal compartments Histone posttranslational modifications mediate establishment of structurally and functionally distinct chromatin compartments of eukaryotic nuclei. Recent studies employing chromatin conformation capture techniques indicate that Hox clusters adopt a remarkable spatial configuration, in which active and inactive genes are segregated into two distinct chromatin compartments. Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains. Interaction of SP100 with HP1 proteins: a link between the promyelocytic leukemia-associated nuclear bodies and the chromatin compartment. We propose that basically three nuclear compartments exist, an &quot;open&quot; higher-order chromatin compartment with chromatin domains containing active genes, a &quot;closed&quot; chromatin compartment comprising inactive genes, and an interchromatin domain (ICD) compartment (Cremer et al., 1993; Zirbel et al., 1993) that contains macromolecular complexes for transcription, splicing, DNA replication, and repair. Genes in &quot;open,&quot; but not in &quot;closed&quot; higher-order chromatin compartments have access to transcription and splicing complexes located in the ICD compartment. Genes in &quot;open,&quot; but not in &quot;closed&quot; higher-order chromatin compartments have access to transcription and splicing complexes located in the ICD compartment. Chromatin domains that build the &quot;open&quot; chromatin compartment are organized in a way that allows the direct contact of genes and nascent RNA to transcription and splicing complexes, respectively, preformed in the ICD compartment. We propose that basically three nuclear compartments exist, an &quot;open&quot; higher-order chromatin compartment with chromatin domains containing active genes, a &quot;closed&quot; chromatin compartment comprising inactive genes, and an interchromatin domain (ICD) compartment (Cremer et al.

5e35c75d158f994d3a000001	List targeted genome editing methodologies	TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in the early-branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis. Non-bilaterian phyla represent key lineages for exploring the evolutionary history of early animals. However, despite an increasing number of sequenced genomes from early-branching metazoans, efficient and reproducible methodologies for analysis of gene function remain a major challenge. Here we report the utilization of the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems to induce targeted mutations and homologous recombination-mediated transgenesis in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We also present a new method to isolate genetically modified animals using engineered selection cassettes introduced by homologous recombination. Taken together, these methods will permit sophisticated gain- and loss-of-function analyses in Nematostella and perhaps other early metazoan species that allow for zygotic injection. Comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs on editing an integrated EGFP gene in the genome of HEK293FT cells. Genome editors such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs are at the forefront of research into methodologies for targeted modification of the mammalian genome. To date few comparative studies have been carried out to investigate the difference of genome editing characteristics between CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has overtaken TALENs as the tool of choice for most research groups working in this field, we hypothesized that there could be certain applications whereby the application of TALENs would have specific benefits. Here we compare CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN as tools for introducing site-specific editing events at an integrated EGFP gene in the genome of HEK293FT cells.RESULTS: Guide RNAs and TALEN pairs were designed to target two loci within the EGFP gene. We found that paired Cas9 nucleases induced targeted genomic deletion more efficiently and precisely than two TALEN pairs. However, when concurrently supplied with a plasmid template spanning the two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within EGFP, TALENs stimulated homology directed repair (HDR) more efficiently than CRISPR/Cas9 and caused fewer targeted genomic deletions.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the choice of genome editing tool should be determined by the desired genome editing outcome. Such a rational approach is likely to benefit research outputs for groups working in fields as diverse as modification of cell lines, to animal models for disease studies, or gene therapy strategies.

5d38673da1e1595105000002	Which micro-RNAs (miR) are associated with the human cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene promoter?	The mRNA stability factor HuR inhibits microRNA-16 targeting of COX-2. . We identified miR-16 to bind the COX-2 3'-UTR and inhibit COX-2 expression by promoting rapid mRNA decay. However, miR-143-5p alone directly targets COX-2, and it exhibits a stronger tumor suppressive effect than miR-143-3p. The NF-ÎºB family member RelB regulates microRNA miR-146a to suppress cigarette smoke-induced COX-2 protein expression in lung fibroblasts. TargetScan analysis predicted COX-2 as a target of miR-26a and miR-26b. miR-26a/-26b decreased luciferase activity associated with COX-2-3'-UTR. icroRNA-26a/-26b-COX-2-MIP-2 Loop Regulates Allergic Inflammation and Allergic Inflammation-promoted Enhanced Tumorigenic and Metastatic Potential of Cancer Cells Downregulated microRNA-26a modulates prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting COX-2. microRNA-142-3p inhibits apoptosis and inflammation induced by bleomycin through down-regulation of Cox-2 in MLE-12 cells.  Up-regulation of Cox-2 and inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR were found in bleomycin-pretreated cells, while these abnormal regulations were partially abolished by miR-142-3p overexpression and NS-398. MicroRNA-144 is regulated by CP2 and decreases COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in mouse ovarian granulosa cells. overexpression of miR-144 significantly decreased the luciferase reporter activity under the control of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) or mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 4 (Smad4) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed COX-2 and Smad4 expression. In contrast, a miR-144 inhibitor increased COX-2 and Smad4 expression in mouse granulosa cells (mGCs The down-regulation of microRNA-137 contributes to the up-regulation of retinoblastoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating COX-2/PGE2 signaling. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was a potential target gene of miR-137, which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, our results showed that miR-137 negatively regulated the expression of COX-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RB cells. MicroRNA-128 inhibits proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by targeting COX-2.  the inhibitory effects of miR-128 mimics on the invasion and proliferation of glioma cells were reversed by overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Our data showed that COX-2 was a candidate target of miR-128. Luciferase activity of 3'-UTR of COX-2 was reduced in the presence of miR-128 miR-128 obviously decreased COX-2 mRNA stability determined by real time PCR. Contrarily, we found that miR-128 inhibitor significantly increased the COX-2 mRNA expression, and elevated the protein expression of MMP9 and ki67, and promoted the proliferation of glioma cells. MicroRNA-146b-3p regulates the development and progression of cerebral infarction with diabetes through RAF1/P38MAPK/COX-2 signaling pathway Our data have implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p is closely related to the progression and development of DCMI mediating the RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signal transduction pathway.

54cf705ff693c3b16b000014	List receptors of the drug Cilengitide	Cilengitide inhibits attachment and invasion of malignant pleural mesothelioma cells through antagonism of integrins Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5. Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide, an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development. As there is evidence for expression of the integrins Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin Î±v heterodimer with high specificity for Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5.  Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5. Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy.  Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrin receptors. RESULTS: Î±vÎ²5 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas Î±vÎ²3 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 Î¼g/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines.  UW479 cells expressed only Î±vÎ²5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on Î±vÎ²3 inhibition. Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on Î±vÎ²3 expression and sensitivity to anoikis.  METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8).  The Î±VÎ²3/Î±VÎ²5 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model. Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.   Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the Î±vÎ²3, Î±vÎ²5, and Î±5Î²1 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence.  Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma. The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the Î±Î½Î² 3 and Î±Î½Î² 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases.  We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of Î±(v)Î²(3) and Î±(v)Î²(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA.  AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting Î±vÎ²(3)/Î±(v) Î²(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of Î±vÎ²(3) and Î±vÎ²(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).   In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that Î±vÎ²(3)/Î±vÎ²(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases. Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma.  Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study.  In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040).  Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors. BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist.  Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours. A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity.  This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2.  The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the Î±Î½Î² 3 and Î±Î½Î² 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases	[['Î±vÎ²3 integrin'], ['Î±Î½Î²5 integrin'], ['Î±vÎ²5', 'Î±vÎ²3']]

55192f20622b194345000014	Which proteins are the different members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors?	The transcription factor NF-kappaB is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of Rel/NF-kappaB-family polypeptides, which include Rel-A, c-Rel, Rel-B, NF-kappaB/p50 and NF-kappaB2/p52 . Nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB) is a dimeric transcription factor comprised of five family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 and p52. In mammals, the genes rela, relb, crel, nfkappaÎ1, and nfkappaB encode the five NF-kB protein family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, respectively, which form homo- and heterodimeric DNA-binding complexes capable of regulating target gene transcription of specific biological responses differentially. These results suggest that the Rel-homology domain can act as an allosteric effector to promote transcription by p50/NFkappaB1 and that the configuration of p50 is important for its activity.

56cf4b623975bb303a00000a	List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.	 MAOA metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters.  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) modulates metabolism of serotonin and dopamine metabolism, neurotransmitters involved in regulation of appetite and food intake.  Tumors from patients with high-grade aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit increased expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.  These traits are controlled by neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of amines, has been reported to be associated with aggression, impulsivity, depression, and mood changes. Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) is a critical enzyme in the catabolism of monoaminergic neurotransmitters.  Monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) have a key role in the degradation of amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin.  Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters including serotonin and norepinephrine, are commonly used to treat neurological conditions including depression.  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters.

In this work, we propose a method based on radial basis networks for predicting the number of beta-strands in OMPs and identifying their membrane spanning segments. We have developed a web server, TMBETAPRED-RBF for predicting the transmembrane beta-strands from amino acid sequence and it is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/tmrbf.html. We have developed a prediction server, TMBETADISC-RBF, which is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/OMP.html. TMB finding pipeline: novel approach for detecting beta-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences. Interestingly, the present approach identified TMBs from all 15 families in TCDB. A new method is presented for identification of beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture obeying these proteins' construction principles. Once the HMM is trained, log-odds score relative to a null model is used to discriminate beta-barrel membrane proteins from other proteins. PRED-TMBB: a web server for predicting the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins. We present here a web server (PRED-TMBB, http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB) which is capable of predicting the transmembrane strands and the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. The method is based on a Hidden Markov Model, trained according to the Conditional Maximum Likelihood criterion. Predicting transmembrane beta-barrels in proteomes. Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs. A sequence-profile-based HMM for predicting and discriminating beta barrel membrane proteins. RESULTS: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. BOMP: a program to predict integral beta-barrel outer membrane proteins encoded within genomes of Gram-negative bacteria. This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. On the basis of existing knowledge of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins, several state of the art prediction methods, as well as a new in-house program (PROB) were employed for the systematic exploration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes for potential beta-barrel structures. Computational identification of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes as putative vaccine candidates. BETAWARE: a machine-learning tool to detect and predict transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in prokaryotes. Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. Supersecondary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane Î²-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods. BOCTOPUS: improved topology prediction of transmembrane Î² barrel proteins. Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). TMBHMM: a frequency profile based HMM for predicting the topology of transmembrane beta barrel proteins and the exposure status of transmembrane residues. We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. We present BTMX (Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure), a computational method to predict the exposure status (i.e. exposed to the bilayer or hidden in the protein structure) of transmembrane residues in transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs). BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84.2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions. A method for discovering transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in Gram-negative bacterial proteomes. A web server based on the proposed method is available at http://yanbioinformatics.cs.usu.edu:8080/TMBKNNsubmit. This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for discriminating TMB and non-TMB proteins. TMBpro: secondary structure, beta-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. A consensus algorithm to screen genomes for novel families of transmembrane beta barrel proteins. Here we describe a new algorithm combining composition and hidden Markov model topology based classifiers (called TMB-Hunt2), which achieves a crossvalidation accuracy of >95%, with 96.7% precision and 94.2% recall.

Etoposide is effective as an anti-tumour drug by inhibiting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II via establishing a covalent complex with DNA benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles and related fused heterocyclic compounds, which exhibited significant eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitory activity F14512, a polyamine-containing inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II F14512, an epipodophyllotoxin derivative equipped with a spermine moiety, is selectively taken up by the polyamine transport system over-active in tumor cells F14512 combines an epipodophyllotoxin core-targeting topoisomerase II with a spermine moiety introduced as a cell delivery vector. The polyamine tail supports three complementary functions: (a) facilitate formulation of a water-soluble compound, (b) increase DNA binding to reinforce topoisomerase II inhibition, and (c) facilitate selective uptake by tumor cells via the PTS Twenty previously synthesized fused heterocyclic DNA-topoisomerase II (Topo II)-inhibiting compounds were investigated for their potential efficacy in various human cancer cell lines that were derived from different tumor entities In conclusion, compounds BD 13, BD 14, BD 16, D 23 and D 24 may be useful for the treatment of different multidrug-resistant cancer cells with cross resistance against "classical" Topo II-targeting drugs.

METHODS: Outcomes of surgery, prognostic factors for survival, and relevance of Tomita and Tokuhashi scores were investigated. PURPOSE: To assess variability in the use of Tomita and modified Bauer scores in spine metastases. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.  .CONCLUSION: The Tomita scoring system represents a practicable and highly predictive prognostic tool.  Analysis of the predictive role and new proposal for surgical strategies based on the modified Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems for spinal metastasis. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems.  CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores.  A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis.  It is for this reason that scoring systems, such as the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, have been created The modified Tokuhashi score had better accuracy in determining actual survival. Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so. Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi score independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases.  Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery. A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery. Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease. Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis. Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC.Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution.The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC.The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems.Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis The data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases A retrospective study of 180 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases, wherein prognostic score-predicted survival was compared with actual survival.To evaluate and compare the accuracy of prognostic scoring systems in lung cancer spinal metastases.The modified Tokuhashi, Tomita, modified Bauer, and Oswestry scores are currently used to guide decisions regarding operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases. To evaluate the predictive values of Tokuhashi score, revised Tokuhashi score and Tomita score systems for life expectancy and treatment options in patients with spinal metastasis. A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis. The combination of Tokuhashi score and Tomita score may be applied to better predict postoperative survival prognosis and guide the surgical options for patients with spinal metastasis.. reported a composite model taking into account a modified Bauer score, preoperative albumin, and ambulatory status of patients with spinal metastasis.

54fb6fb5d176fff445000004	Which proteins participate in the formation of the Notch transcriptional activation complex?	The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding factor CSL and a transcriptional co-activator of the Mastermind family (MAML). The "RAM" region of NICD recruits Notch to CSL, facilitating the binding of MAML at the interface between the ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain of NICD and CSL. Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression. Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled. Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane. ICN then travels into the nucleus where it drives the assembly of a transcriptional activation complex containing the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL, ICN, and a specialized co-activator of the Mastermind family. A consensus DNA binding site motif for the CSL protein was previously defined using selection-based methods, but whether subsequent association of Notch and Mastermind-like proteins affects the DNA binding preferences of CSL has not previously been examined. We report here the crystal structure of a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing the ankyrin domain of human Notch1 (ANK), the transcription factor CSL on cognate DNA, and a polypeptide from the coactivator Mastermind-like-1 (MAML-1).  Ligand binding by Notch receptors triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that liberate the intracellular portion of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane, permitting it to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex. On the basis of our results, we present a working structural model for the organization of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading. We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis. Mastermind (Mam) is a component of Notch pathway signaling. In combination with the intracellular domain of Notch and Suppressor of Hairless, Mam forms a transcriptional activation complex. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA.

Assessment of EGFR mutations in circulating tumor cell preparations from NSCLC patients by next generation sequencing: toward a real-time liquid biopsy for treatment. We report for the first time that the CellSearch System coupled with NGS is a very sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for EGFR mutation analysis in CTC preparations with potential clinical impact. In this respect, mutation analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be desirable since they may provide real-time information on patient's disease status. Exosomal miRNA Analysis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients' Plasma Through qPCR: A Feasible Liquid Biopsy Tool. These plasma-isolated exosomes can be used as a non-invasive and repeatable way for the detection and follow-up of these biomarkers. Liquid biopsy reflected spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the tumor under treatment pressure. We provide the proof-of-concept that the complementary use of ctDNA and ctcDNA represents a reliable, minimally invasive and dynamic tool for a more comprehensive view of tumor evolution. The isolation and analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA in plasma is a powerful tool with considerable potential to improve clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types, including NSCLC In summary, the panel concluded that liquid biopsy approaches have significant potential to improve patient care, and immediate implementation in the clinic is justified in a number of therapeutic settings relevant to NSCLC.

516ec97f298dcd4e51000087	By which methods can we evaluate the reliability of a phylogenetic tree?	For robustness evaluation, we apply bootstrap and jackknife techniques to input data. An alignment confidence score capturing robustness to guide tree uncertainty. We build on the widely used bootstrap method for perturbing the phylogenetic tree. SuperTRI: A new approach based on branch support analyses of multiple independent data sets for assessing reliability of phylogenetic inferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, called SuperTRI, which is based on the branch support analyses of the independent data sets, and where the reliability of the nodes is assessed using three measures: the supertree Bootstrap percentage and two other values calculated from the separate analyses: the mean branch support (mean Bootstrap percentage or mean posterior probability) and the reproducibility index. In contrast to other similar software, the program FreeTree (available at http://www.natur.cuni.cz/~flegr/programs/freetree or http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/vol51/issue3/) can also assess the robustness of the tree topology by bootstrap, jackknife or operational taxonomic unit-jackknife analysis. Unlike any previous tool for inferring phylogenies from rearrangement data, TIBA uses novel methods of robustness estimation to provide support values for the edges in the inferred tree. Fast and accurate phylogenetic reconstruction from high-resolution whole-genome data and a novel robustness estimator. Moreover, whereas phylogenetic analyses from sequence data are deemed incomplete unless bootstrapping scores (a measure of confidence) are given for each tree edge, no equivalent to bootstrapping exists for rearrangement-based phylogenetic analysis. We also describe a novel approach to estimate the robustness of results-an equivalent to the bootstrapping analysis used in sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction. The standard deviation also suggests the reliability level of the branch order. Assessment of the reliability of a given phylogenetic hypothesis is an important step in phylogenetic analysis. The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was probed with the bootstrapping of 100 replicates of the original sequence alignments.	[['bootstrap'], ['jackknife']]

5539029cbc4f83e828000012	Which genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development?	Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups. Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1 and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotype Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation PCDH10 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene in medulloblastoma The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progression We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were associated with significantly decreased patient survival Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's expression and survival in children with medulloblastoma Bmi1 is required for Hedgehog pathway-driven medulloblastoma expansion These data provide the first demonstration that Bmi1 is required for spontaneous de novo development of a solid tumor arising in the brain, suggest a crucial role for Bmi1-dependent, nestin-expressing progenitor cells in medulloblastoma expansion, and implicate Bmi1 as a key factor required for Hh pathway-driven tumorigenesis Genomic amplification of orthodenticle homologue 2 in medulloblastomas Genomic alterations normally associated with medulloblastomas, including MYC amplification and isochromosome 17q, were easily detected. Surprisingly, analysis of only five genomes revealed novel amplicons on chromosome 14q, one of which contained the orthodenticle homologue 2 (OTX2) homeobox gene. DNA copy number analysis showed that OTX2 had undergone genomic amplification in 2 of 11 medulloblastoma cell lines and 8 of 42 primary tumors Serial analysis of gene expression of 240 different human tumors or normal tissues revealed that 96% of all 783 OTX2 transcripts sequenced were in medulloblastomas or embryonic stem cells OTX2 functions to specify the fate of neuroectoderm in various regions of the developing brain. This developmental role is consistent with the evidence suggesting that OTX2 is a medulloblastoma oncogene Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella) In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum These data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis Biallelic epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma development Seventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG island Hypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine Epigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma RASSF1A hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological variants and age and sex groupings Medulloblastoma, a brain tumor, develops in about 3% of NBCCS patients, and mutations in PTCH have also been described in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomas Recently, a transgenic mouse hemizygous for the Ptch gene was generated by homologous recombination. Medulloblastomas were found in about 19% of these mice within the first 25 weeks after birth We also examined the mRNA expression levels for the remaining Ptch allele, as well as for Gli1, a gene known to be transcriptionally activated by Ptch inactivation. Blot analysis of RNA from the 13 tumors shows that Ptch mRNA of appropriate size is expressed in all tumors at varying levels. Expression of Gli1 was increased in tumors compared to normal cerebellum. These results suggest that deletion of one copy of Ptch may be sufficient to promote medulloblastoma development in mice	[['PTCH1'], ['SUFU'], ['PTEN'], ['CREBBP'], ['PTEN'], ['MYT1L'], ['NFIA'], ['NFIB'], ['TEAD1'], ['TGIF2'], ['IGF2'], ['PCDH10'], ['BMI1'], ['MYC'], ['OTX2'], ['RASSF1A'], ['HIC1'], ['CASP8']]

5e369ecfb5b409ea53000002	List T-UCRs that have been implicated in breast cancer	Ultraconserved long non-coding RNA uc.63 in breast cancer. We found that overexpression of one specific T-UCRs named uc.63 is associated with bad outcome in luminal A subtype of breast cancer patients. uc.63 is localized in the third intron of exportin-1 gene (XPO1) and is transcribed in the same orientation of its host gene. Interestingly, silencing of uc.63 induces apoptosis in vitro. However, silencing of host gene XPO1 does not cause the same effect suggesting that the transcription of uc.63 is independent of XPO1. Our results reveal an important role of uc.63 in promoting breast cancer cells survival and offer the prospect to identify a signature associated with poor prognosis. uc.38 induces breast cancer cell apoptosis via PBX1. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis. Describing the uc.38/PBX1 axis has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer apoptosis and has suggested that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

5148e1d6d24251bc0500003a	Mutation of which gene and which chromosome cause Neurofibromatosis type I?	The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. Nine markers from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 were typed in 16 British and five South African families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Inspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers suggests that the NF1 gene is located between the markers EW301 (cen-p11.2) and EW206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to pHHH202 (q11.2-q12). The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. To better map the location of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7AE-11. This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint. The frequent LOH surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with NF1. In the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, cafÃ©-au-lait spots and axillary freckling. In addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis I gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of NF1. Duplicon-mediated microdeletions around the NF1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type I in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower IQ values. Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans. It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. In 95% of NF1 individuals, a mutation is found in the NF1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the NF1 gene and several flanking genes. Herein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented NF1. Genetic study (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated no chromosomal losses or gains. Testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the EGFR, p16, PTEN, MDM2 and NF1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of PTEN, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons. A patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type I is described. The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17. Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. The NFI gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases. A novel mutation c.4821delA was identified in NF1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p.Leu1607fs). She had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene. RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members. Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene. We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation. The disease gene of the Chinese NF1 family was linked to NF1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, G1336X in the NF1 gene was identified. The present study demonstrated that G1336X mutation in the NF1 gene cause Neurofibromatosis type I in the family.	[['NF1 gene'], ['chromosome 17']]
54db7c4ac0bb8dce23000001	Which protein kinases have been found to phosphorylate Phospholamban and affect its biological activity?	Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects.  We have found that phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A (PKA) leads to an increase in the rate of Ca(2+) leak from Ca(2+)-loaded SR vesicles. PKG activity of cardiac myocytes was assessed by phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation determined by western blot.  PLB is not a unique reporter for PKG activity since it is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA),  Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an important role mediating apoptosis/necrosis during ischemia-reperfusion (IR). The onset of reperfusion increased the phosphorylation of Thr(17) site of phospholamban, without changes in total protein, consistent with an increase in CaMKII activity.  We found that when activated, Akt interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr(17), the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIdelta site, whereas silencing Akt signaling, through the knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PLN at Thr(17).  Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Dephosphorylated PLN tonically inhibits the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a), while phosphorylation at Ser16 by PKA and Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) relieves the inhibition, and this increases SR Ca(2+) uptake.  Both CaMKIIdelta(C) and the novel CaMKIIbeta(4) isoforms were found to exist in complex with alphaKAP and SERCA2a at the SR and were able to phosphorylate Thr-17 on phospholamban (PLN), an accessory subunit and known regulator of SERCA2a activity Phospholamban is the major membrane protein of the heart phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. In cell-free systems, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes exclusive phosphorylation of serine 16 of phospholamban, whereas Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gives exclusive phosphorylation of threonine 17 (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, J. L., Wegener, A. D., and Jones, L. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333-13341).

5713bf261174fb1755000011	For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?	To determine the potential of an integrated, image-based computer-aided design (CAD) and 3-dimensional (3D) printing approach to engineer scaffolds for head and neck cartilaginous reconstruction for auricular and nasal reconstruction. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds was performed in a porcine model. Auricular and nasal constructs with several types of microporous architecture were rapidly manufactured with high fidelity to human patient anatomy. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth. Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds demonstrated native-appearing cartilaginous growth that respected the boundaries of the scaffold.CONCLUSION: Integrated, image-based CAD and 3D printing processes generated patient-specific nasal and auricular scaffolds that supported cartilage regeneration. A prototype meniscus cartilage was prepared to illustrate the potential application in bioengineering. As a proof of concept, we generated a bionic ear via 3D printing of a cell-seeded hydrogel matrix in the anatomic geometry of a human ear, along with an intertwined conducting polymer consisting of infused silver nanoparticles. This allowed for in vitro culturing of cartilage tissue around an inductive coil antenna in the ear, which subsequently enables readout of inductively-coupled signals from cochlea-shaped electrodes. The printed ear exhibits enhanced auditory sensing for radio frequency reception, and complementary left and right ears can listen to stereo audio music.  In this study, we describe the construction of a hybrid inkjet printing/electrospinning system that can be used to fabricate viable tissues for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed 3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer design using patient-specific anatomical data 3D printing of HEK 293FT cell-laden hydrogel into macroporous constructs with high cell viability and normal biological functions. 3D-printing of lightweight cellular composites. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for transplantation.  In this paper, we reported a novel study of 3D printing of cell lines derived from human embryonic kidney tissue into a macroporous tissue-like construct.  Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues.  Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of "blueprints" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. Organ printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of "blueprints" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. Bioprinting has no or little side effect to the printed mammalian cells and it can conveniently combine with gene transfection or drug delivery to the ejected living systems during the precise placement for tissue construction. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues.

58919aad621ea6ff7e00000d	List selective estrogen receptor degraders.	For women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapies, including the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant, are recommended in clinical guidelines. Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. Identification of GDC-0810 (ARN-810), an Orally Bioavailable Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) that Demonstrates Robust Activity in Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer Xenografts. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-Î± and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents.  Evaluation of the pharmacological activities of RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor degrader. However, being the only SERD currently known to access the brain, RAD1901 merits evaluation as a targeted therapy for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases. Tamoxifen, toremifene, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant are used to treat breast cancer, and tamoxifen and raloxifene protect against breast cancer in high-risk women. The turnover of estrogen receptor Î± by the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant is a saturable process that is not required for antagonist efficacy. Currently, ICI 182,780 (ICI, fulvestrant) is the only SERD approved for the treatment of breast cancer.  Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-Ã¡ and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents.

RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation.  The selective estrogen receptor degrader, fulvestrant, significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of ESR1 mutant-expressing cells, while combination treatments with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, or an inhibitor blocking IGF1R, and the insulin receptor significantly enhanced anti-proliferative responses. SUM-44Â cells do not require exogenous estrogen for growth inÂ vitro; however, they are dependent on ERÎ± expression, as ESR1 knock-down or exposure to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in growth inhibition.

54df6ed91388e8454a000007	List non-surgical treatment modalities that are included in the Stupp protocol.	OBJECTIVE: It is now accepted that the concomitant administration of temozolomide with radiotherapy (Stupp regime), in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), significantly improves survival and this practice has been adopted locally since 2004. BACKGROUND: The introduction of ALA-Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp-protocol is representative of the major changes in glioblastoma therapy in the past years. CONCLUSIONS: FGS and radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol have induced an impressive improvement in overall survival in glioblastoma patients.  Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy.  The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients with primary GBM were postoperatively treated with either radiation and concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ (Stupp protocol) (n = 154), or radiation followed by adjuvant TMZ (n = 37). Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol.  The treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by chemoradiation with the protocol of Stupp et al.  Since the publication of a study by Stupp et al in 2005, which used a protocol of conventional fractionated irradiation with concomitant TMZ followed by standard TMZ for six cycles, many clinical studies in the People's Republic of China have demonstrated that such a treatment strategy has significantly improved efficacy with limited side effects for newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgery as compared with strategies that do not contain TMZ. Standard chemoradiotherapy as per the Stupp protocol, together with multimodal rehabilitation, resulted in substantial functional improvement within 6 weeks of initiation. BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma treated with BCNU wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the Stupp protocol. This is followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) according to the Stupp protocol.  CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status and low MGMT expression both were identified as positive prognosticators in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection and received Gliadel wafer implants followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant oral TMZ chemotherapy (the Stupp protocol). INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the incidence and impact of early post-chemoradiation (cRT) 'pseudoprogression' (PsPD) amongst glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with the current standard of care - 60 Gy conformal radiotherapy with concurrent low-dose temozolomide, followed by six cycles of high-dose temozolomide (the 'Stupp protocol').  In patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is no consensus on the sequential use of two existing regimens: post-operative Gliadel implantation into the surgical cavity and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide ('Stupp protocol').  We also screened for associations between the level of methylation of CpG sites and overall survival in a cohort of 50 patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (STUPP protocol).  Surprisingly, less than half the patients having surgery received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol.  We analyzed MGMT methylation by methylation-specific PCR in 90 GBM patients from four Portuguese hospitals, uniformly treated with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp protocol). The current care standards for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consist, when feasible, in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, as described in the Stupp protocol.  Moreover, there are no data concerning the effect of concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the STUPP protocol on the course ofMS in patients with coexisting glioblastoma.  Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol	[['radiotherapy'], ['chemotherapy']]
530cefaaad0bf1360c000003	What are the names of anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that is used for treatment of multiple sclerosis patients?	Alemtuzumab offers induction strategy for very active relapsing MS patients who have failed conventional therapy, and possibly selected treatment-naive patients. Differential reconstitution of T cell subsets following immunodepleting treatment with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 mAb) provides long-lasting disease activity suppression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, increased the risk of thyroid dysfunction in CAMMS223, a phase 2 trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFNÎ²-1a), in treatment-naÃ¯ve and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFNÎ²-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the CD52 protein present at high levels on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. In clinical trials, alemtuzumab has shown a clinical benefit superior to that of interferon-Î² in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. These results potentially help explain the level of immunocompetence observed in alemtuzumab-treated MS patients. Alemtuzumab was first used in multiple sclerosis in 1991. It is a monoclonal antibody which is directed against CD52, a protein of unknown function on lymphocytes.  Against an active comparator and the current first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (interferon-beta), alemtuzumab showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate as well as a significant reduction in the accumulation of disability.  Alemtuzumab (previously known as Campath(Â®)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes that results in lymphopenia and subsequent modification of the immune repertoire.  Compared to interferon beta-1a, alemtuzumab reduced the relapse rate by 49%-74% (P < 0.0001), and in two studies it reduced the risk of sustained disability accumulation by 42%-71% (P < 0.01). In one study (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis; CARE-MS1), there was no significant difference compared to interferon, perhaps reflecting the surprisingly low frequency of disability events in the comparator group. Alemtuzumab has been submitted for licensing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States and Europe. Alemtuzumab was associated with a greater chance of improved contrast sensitivity in patients with RRMS and may delay the worsening of visual function.  The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduced disease activity in a phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Alemtuzumab's consistent safety profile and benefit in terms of reductions of relapse support its use for patients with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, benefit in terms of disability endpoints noted in previous trials was not observed here.  Alemtuzumab, formally known as Campath-1H, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a protein on the surface of lymphocytes and monocytes with unknown function. A single dose of alemtuzumab leads to a rapid, profound and prolonged lymphopenia. A Phase II trial has shown that alemtuzumab reduces the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability by over 70% compared with interferon beta in patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Alemtuzumab, targeting CD52 expressed on T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and macrophages, has also shown to be effective in early RRMS and phase III trials are currently ongoing.  monoclonal antibody therapy has provided the opportunity to rationally direct the therapeutic intervention by specifically targeting mechanisms of the immune system such as CD52 (alemtuzumab), CD25 (daclizumab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and CD20 (rituximab) Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, a broadly expressed cell surface molecule on immune cells. Alemtuzumab-treatment of MS patients with relapsing-remitting forms of the disease significantly reduced the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability compared to interferon Î²-1a treatment in a phase II trial.  Alemtuzumab (CD52-specific humanized monoclonal antibody) was found to be an effective therapy for treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Alemtuzumab effectively reduced relapse rates and improved clinical scores in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis not controlled by interferon therapy. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody with remarkable efficacy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).  The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduces disease activity in previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  For patients with first-line treatment-refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab could be used to reduce relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability.  Campath-1H causes the immune response to change from the Th1 phenotype, suppressing multiple sclerosis disease activity, but permitting the generation of antibody-mediated thyroid autoimmunity. Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation. Campath 1-H (Alemtuzumab) is a humanised monoclonal antibody which targets the CD52 antigen, a low molecular weight glycoprotein present on the surface of most lymphocyte lineages, causing complement mediated lysis and rapid and prolonged T lymphocyte depletion. Following encouraging initial data from other centres we report our open label experience of using Campath 1-H as a treatment in aggressive relapsing multiple sclerosis in a consecutive series of 39 highly selected patients treated across three regional centres and followed for a mean of 1.89 years. Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on lymphocytes and monocytes, may be an effective treatment for early multiple sclerosis.  In patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab was more effective than interferon beta-1a but was associated with autoimmunity, most seriously manifesting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, is a highly promising agent currently being studied in two phase III clinical trials. In this review, data from the recently published phase II clinical trial in the treatment of early relapsing remitting MS is summarized and analyzed in light of the development of alemtuzumab for MS and its potential role in treating this disease is discussed. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52, an antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant lymphocytes. It is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  To assess the effect of systemic lymphocyte depletion on disease activity, seven patients with MS received a 10-day intravenous course of the humanised monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CDw52). The effect of CAMPATH-1H on disease activity provides direct, but preliminary, evidence that disease activity in MS depends on the availability of circulating lymphocytes and can be prevented by lymphocyte depletion. The elective treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis, using a humanized anti-leukocyte (CD52) monoclonal antibody (Campath-1H), has illuminated mechanisms that underlie the clinical course of the disease.  Alemtuzumab is currently under review to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, based on positive Phase II and Phase III trials in both treatment-naÃ¯ve and treated relapsing MS patients.  Alemtuzumab has recently been approved by the European authorities for active relapsing MS, in essence as a first-line agent. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52.

57090784cf1c325851000011	Which syndromes are associated with mutations in the EZH2 gene?	Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, a catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are observed in ~\n10% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but are rare in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) We describe the use of an oligo-SNP array for genomic profiling of aCNA and cnLOH, together with sequence analysis of recurrently mutated genes, in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presenting with normal karyotype and FISH result  Conditionally deleting Ezh2 in mature T cells dramatically reduced the production of BM-destructive Th1 cells in vivo, decreased BM-infiltrating Th1 cells, and rescued mice from BM failure. Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a potentially fatal bone marrow (BM) failure syndrome Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. EZH2 mutations that cause Weaver syndrome are primarily missense variants and the rare truncating mutations reported to date are in the last exon, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be generating the overgrowth phenotype although the exact mechanism has not yet been determined Weaver syndrome and EZH2 mutations In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes.  Mutations in EZH2 cause Weaver syndrome These data show that mutations in EZH2 cause Weaver syndrome The EZH2 mutation spectrum in Weaver syndrome shows considerable overlap with the inactivating somatic EZH2 mutations recently reported in myeloid malignancies EZH2 mutations as the cause of Weaver syndrome and provide further links between histone modifications and regulation of human growth. Mutations at tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) in the SET domain of EZH2 have been identified in patients with certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype Recent extensive mutation analyses of the myeloid malignancies have revealed that inactivating somatic mutations in PcG genes such as EZH2 and ASXL1 occur frequently in patients with myelodysplastic disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap disorders (MDS/MPN). EZH2 is frequently overexpressed and considered to be an oncogene in cancers; nevertheless, EZH2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in MDS due to EZH2 mutations associated with poor survival. In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. Weaver syndrome and EZH2 mutations: Clarifying the clinical phenotype. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes. We postulated that mutations in writers of these two chromatin marks could cause overgrowth conditions, resembling Sotos or Weaver syndromes, in patients with no NSD1 or EZH2 abnormalities. Recent extensive mutation analyses of the myeloid malignancies have revealed that inactivating somatic mutations in PcG genes such as EZH2 and ASXL1 occur frequently in patients with myelodysplastic disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap disorders (MDS/MPN).  Somatic mutations of epigenetic gene regulators are common in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and correlate with some clinical and laboratory features.  Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75-80% of MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i.e. cytokine signaling (RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications (ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with mutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. NSD1 mutations that cause Sotos syndrome are loss-of-function, primarily truncating mutations or missense mutations at key residues in functional domains. EZH2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in MDS due to EZH2 mutations associated with poor survival. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes. EZH2 is frequently overexpressed and considered to be an oncogene in cancers; nevertheless, EZH2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in MDS due to EZH2 mutations associated with poor survival. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. The deletion involved multiple genes, including two tumor suppressor candidate genes (CTNNA1 and HSPA9) that are associated with MDS/AML. Somatic mutations of epigenetic gene regulators are common in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and correlate with some clinical and laboratory features.

5a737b483b9d13c70800000b	Which drugs were tested in the KEYNOTE-006 study?	The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma: final overall survival results of a multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006). BACKGROUND: Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules.  OBJECTIVE: Report results of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms from phase III KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. Patient-reported outcomes in KEYNOTE-006, a randomised study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma Pembrolizumab (Keytruda(Â®)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), a key immunoinhibitory checkpoint protein implicated in down-regulating anti-tumour immune responses. This intravenous drug is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, on the basis of its clinical benefit in this setting in the phase I KEYNOTE 001 trial (expansion cohorts) and the phase II and III trials, KEYNOTE 002 and 006. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. (Funded by Merck Sharp&Dohme; KEYNOTE-006 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01866319.). Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. Report results of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms from phase III KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head-to-head phase III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. BACKGROUND Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. OBJECTIVE Report results of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms from phase III KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. INTERPRETATION Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. In the trials with active comparator arms, pembrolizumab regimens significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rates (ORR) relative to ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naÃ¯ve patients (KEYNOTE 006), and significantly improved PFS and ORR, but not OS (although OS data are immature), relative to chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory patients, who had also received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy if BRAF-mutation positive (KEYNOTE 002).

5a70dbe599e2c3af26000004	Which two genes are implicated in Juvenile polyposis syndrome?	 JPS is most frequently caused by mutations in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Herein, we report a child with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) with a novel mutation in the SMAD4 gene.  Subsequent genetic screening revealed a novel mutation in SMAD4, exon 5 (p.Ser144Stop).  A SMAD4 mutation indicative of juvenile polyposis syndrome in a family previously diagnosed with Menetrier's disease. CONCLUSION: The 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 is the cause of JPS and the likely cause of MD in a large family initially diagnosed with MD. A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD.  ince his initial diagnosis of JPS further studies have confirmed an association between JPS and mutations in BMPR1A in chromosome band 10q23.2, which is in close proximity to PTEN. Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4. Exome sequencing identified a germline heterozygous mutation in SMAD9 (SMAD9(V90M)).  Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Somatic alterations in juvenile polyps from BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients. The JPS is caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Germline mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A disrupt the transforming growth factor Î² signal transduction pathway, and are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. Individuals with JPS due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). BMPR1A and SMAD4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. BACKGROUND In patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) the frequency of large genomic deletions in the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes was unknown. in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome jps the frequency of large genomic deletions in the smad4 and bmpr1a genes was unknown mutation and phenotype analysis was used in 80 unrelated patients of whom 65 met the clinical criteria for jps typical jps and 15 were suspected to have jps by direct sequencing of the two genes point mutations were identified in 30 patients 46 of typical jps using mlpa large genomic deletions were found in 14 of all patients with typical jps six deletions in smad4 and three deletions in bmpr1a mutation analysis of the pten gene in the remaining 41 mutation negative cases uncovered a point mutation in two patients 5 smad4 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of gastric polyposis 73 than did patients with bmpr1a mutations 8 p 0 001 all seven cases of gastric cancer occurred in families with smad4 mutations smad4 mutation carriers with gastric polyps were significantly older at gastroscopy than those without p 0 001 in 22 of the 23 unrelated smad4 mutation carriers hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia hht was also diagnosed clinically the documented histologic findings encompassed a wide distribution of different polyp types comparable with that described in hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes hmps screening for large deletions raised the mutation detection rate to 60 in the 65 patients with typical jps a strong genotype phenotype correlation for gastric polyposis gastric cancer and hht was identified which should have implications for counselling and surveillance histopathological results in hamartomatous polyposis syndromes must be critically interpreted. juvenile polyposis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple distinct juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal cancer the cumulative life time risk of colorectal cancer is 39 and the relative risk is 34 juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes clinically juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis in about 50 60 of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the smad4 or bmpr1a gene is found both genes play a role in the bmp tgf beta signalling pathway it has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so called landscaper mechanism where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment follow up and screening of at risk individuals each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome in addition juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer this review discusses clinical manifestations genetics pathogenesis and management of juvenile polyposis syndrome. juvenile polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by multiple juvenile polyps arising in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers specifically colon cancer bmpr1a and smad4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome we identified a bmpr1a mutation which involves a duplication of coding exon 3 c 230 452 333 441dup1995 on multiple ligation dependent probe amplification in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome the mutation causes a frameshift producing a truncated protein p d112nfsx2 therefore the mutation is believed to be pathogenic we also identified a duplication breakpoint in which alu sequences are located these results suggest that the duplication event resulted from recombination between alu sequences to our knowledge partial duplication in the bmpr1a gene has not been reported previously this is the first case report to document coding exon 3 duplication in the bmpr1a gene in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome. juvenile polyposis syndrome is a dominant gi polyposis syndrome defined by 5 gi juvenile polyps or 1 juvenile polyps with a family history of juvenile polyposis mutations in bmpr1a or smad4 are found in 50 of individuals hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis visceral arteriovenous malformations and

telangiectasia overlap syndrome has previously been reported in 22 of patients with juvenile polyposis due to a smad4 mutation our objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by curacao criteria in our juvenile polyposis smad4 patients this was a cohort study of juvenile polyposis patients in our inherited colon cancer registries hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia manifestations were obtained from medical records patient contact and or prospective hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening the curacao criteria was used for diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 3 criteria diagnostic 2 criteria suspect of prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in juvenile polyposis smad4 patients forty one juvenile polyposis families were identified genetic testing was available for individuals within 18 families smad4 mutations were found in 21 relatives in 9 families eighty one percent of smad4 patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and 14 were suspected of having hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia epistaxis and asthma are the most common symptoms in our overlap patients symptomatic and subclinical arteriovenous malformations were noted near universally there was a single tertiary referral center nearly all juvenile polyposis smad4 patients have the overlap syndrome the clinical implications and need for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening are important factors for genetic testing in juvenile polyposis health care providers must be

5517f9286487737b43000002	Which are the different proteins/isoforms encoded but the ASPH (aspartate beta-hydroxylase) gene in humans?	The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing. The human AbetaH-J-J locus is a genomic sequence which generates three functionally distinct proteins, the enzyme aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase (AbetaH), the structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum junctin, and the membrane-bound calcium binding protein junctate. Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) hydroxylates Asp and Asn residues within EGF-like domains of Notch and Jagged, which mediate cell motility and differentiation. This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells. Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctate is a newly identified integral ER/SR membrane calcium binding protein, which is an alternative splicing form of the same gene generating aspartyl beta-hydroxylase and junctin. Screening a mouse heart cDNA library using canine junctin cDNA as a probe yielded three complete mouse heart cDNAs. One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate. Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously. A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized. The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3.0 and 4.2kb. Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly. The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized. The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain. Evolutionary conservation of this noncatalytic isoform of BAH (humbug) is demonstrated in mouse, man, and Drosophila. The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing Multiple levels of control of the expression of the human A beta H-J-J locus encoding aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase, junctin, and junctate.

5c5315727e3cb0e231000014	What membrane proteins constitute TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)?	TAM-family RTKs AXL and Mer (MerTK).  Deregulation of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK TAM family members AXL or TYRO3  receptors of the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer constitute the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) characterized by a conserved sequence within the kinase domain and adhesion molecule-like extracellular domains. The TYRO3, AXL (also known as UFO) and MERTK (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are aberrantly expressed in multiple haematological and epithelial malignancies. Gas6 was cloned and characterized in 1993 and found to be similar to the plasma anticoagulant protein S. Soon after it was recognized as a growth factor-like molecule, as it interacted with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the TAM family; Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. The TAM subfamily of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) contains three human proteins of therapeutical interest, Axl, Mer, and Tyro3. Increasing evidence shows that the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), which is expressed in macrophages, alleviates inflammatory responses through a negative feedback loop. Among the TAM family of RTKs, AXL (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase) only induces autophagy in macrophages after interaction with its ligand, GAS6 (growth arrest specific 6). A series of recent studies now consolidates the view that phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a common phospholipid constituent of membrane bilayers, is similarly repurposed for use as a signal between cells and that the ligands and receptors of the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are prominent transducers of this signal.

BACKGROUND: Depression, parkinsonism, and hypoventilation (Perry syndrome) or familial motor neuron disease have been linked to mutations in dynactin P150(Glued) (DCTN1). BACKGROUND: Perry syndrome (PS) caused by DCTN1 gene mutation is clinically characterized by autosomal dominant parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss, and hypoventilation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations of the DCTN1 gene have been previously associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with Perry syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by weight loss, parkinsonism, central hypoventilation, and psychiatric disturbances.  OBJECTIVES: Perry syndrome consists of autosomal dominant Parkinsonism, depression, weight loss, and central hypoventilation. A patient with a mood disorder and a Parkinsonian syndrome with frontal cognitive impairment thought to resemble progressive supranuclear palsy defied precise diagnosis until the development of respiratory compromise, prompting consideration of the diagnosis of Perry syndrome. Perry syndrome is a familial parkinsonism associated with central hypoventilation, mental depression, and weight loss.  Perry syndrome (PS) caused by DCTN1 gene mutation is clinically characterized by autosomal dominant parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss, and hypoventilation Perry syndrome is a familial parkinsonism associated with central hypoventilation, mental depression, and weight loss Perry syndrome due to the DCTN1 G71R mutation: a distinctive levodopa responsive disorder with behavioral syndrome, vertical gaze palsy, and respiratory failure Perry syndrome consists of early-onset parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss and hypoventilation, with brain pathology characterized by TDP-43 immunostaining. We carried out genome-wide linkage analysis and identified five disease-segregating mutations affecting the CAP-Gly domain of dynactin (encoded by DCTN1) in eight families with Perry syndrome; these mutations diminish microtubule binding and lead to intracytoplasmic inclusions.

570a922dcf1c325851000028	Which major signaling pathways are regulated by RIP1?	Major signaling pathways regulated by RIP1 include necroptosis, apoptosis, and pro-survival/inflammation NF-ÎºB activation.  receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1)-mediated necroptosis TNF-induced apoptotic signaling pathways were assessed by monitoring levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, A20, and cleavage products of the caspase-8 substrate, RIP1. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases promote the induction of necrotic cell death pathways.  Together our results reveal a specific role for the RIP1-RIP3-DRP1 pathway in RNA virus-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and establish a direct link between inflammation and cell-death signaling pathways. Necroptosis exhibits a unique signaling pathway that requires the involvement of receptor interaction protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIP1 and RIP3),	[['necroptosis'], ['apoptosis'], ['pro-survival/inflammation NF-ÎºB activation']]

This cross-sectional study included 311 Brazilian women (age â¥45 years with amenorrhea â¥12 months). Women showing three or more of the following diagnostic criteria were diagnosed with MetS: waist circumference (WC) â¥88 cm, blood pressure â¥130/85 mmHg, triglycerides â¥150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <50 mg/dl, and glucose â¥100 mg/dl. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were collected. HSP60, HSP70, antibodies to HSP60 and HSP70, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured in serum. Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis. Of the 311 women, 30.9 % (96/311) were diagnosed with MetS. These women were, on average, obese with abdominal fat deposition and had lower HDL values as well as higher triglycerides and glucose levels. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) test values in these women were compatible with insulin resistance (Pâ<â0.05). CRP and   is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several alence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries. This disorder is not only associated with a higher risk of appearance of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, but impacts on the liver in different ways. Nonalc bolic syndrome (MS) components, such as dyslipidemia, prothrombotic status, and increased blood pressure, are risk factors for patients with renal disease. Visceral fat mass is closely related to the MS and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of body compositions and MS on anemia parameters and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Body composition (body mass index and bioimpedance analysis) and laboratory data were obtained from 110 dialysis patients. The MS was identified according to ATP-III criteria. Anemia parameters, hemoglobin (Hgb), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone levels, and rHuEPO requirements over the last 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with the MS seem to reach target Hgb levels more frequently (10-12 g/dL; 66.3% vs 84.8%; P = .03) without any difference in total intravenous iron therapy dosage. MS patients also required lower rHuEPO for reaching similar Hgb levels compared with patients without MS (2679.3 Â± 1936.1 vs 3702.5 Â± 2213.0 U/kg/6 mo; P = .02). There we bolic syndrome (MetS) is typically diagnosed based on abnormalities in specific clustered clinical measures that are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current MetS criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to delineate differential contributions to MetS by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate MetS severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a CFA of a single MetS factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score. RESULTS: Loadings to the single MetS factor differed by sub-group for each MetS component (p<0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. MetS severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of MetS but high MetS severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional MetS components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of MetS for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for MetS-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time.

58a2fac960087bc10a000009	Which are the side effects during tacrine administration in patients with Alzheimer's Disease?	Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Tacrine and its analogues impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics: a lipidomic analysis in rat brain. However, its low therapeutic efficiency and a high incidence of side effects have limited its clinical use.  Tacrine induced significant perturbations in the mitochondrial PL profile, which were detected by means of changes in the relative abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and CL and by the presence of oxidized phosphatidylserines. These results indicate that tacrine and its analogues impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics, thus compromising the activity of brain cells. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity.  The antidementives are well tolerated and undesired effects are rare; except hepatotoxicity of tacrine and gastrointestinal side effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamin and tacrine that result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss are the most common side effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.  Raised serum liver enzymes was the major reason for withdrawal.  Gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia and abdominal pain) were the other major cause of adverse events and for withdrawal, and the odds ratio for withdrawal was also significantly different from one in favour of the control group (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.8-5.1).

532083389b2d7acc7e000003	Are there drugs for Tick-borne Encephalitis?	 tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have been detected in Bulgaria. Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012.  Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family primarily spread through arthropod vectors, and are the major causes of illness and death around the globe. The Flaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus (type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type species, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus diarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to propagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. Despite the extensive research and public health concern associated with flavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any flavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist.

It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus therapie In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. alacyclovir is the only antiviral drug approved for a once-daily dose of suppressive therapy for genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug US FDA approved for a 3-day regimen of episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes. valacyclovir is also indicated in the reduction of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus infection and for the treatment of herpes labialis.  n herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir or placebo (and as equally effective as famciclovir) in shortening the length and severity of herpes zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia.  valacyclovir and famciclovir are efficacious and safe for the treatment of the first episode and recurrent genital herpes and are useful as suppressive therapy for individuals with frequent genital herpes recurrences. valacyclovir and famciclovir have been shown to speed the healing of herpes zoster, and data suggests that these agents also decrease associated acute and chronic pain in people of 50 years of age or older. Valaciclovir (Valtrex), the L-valyl ester of acyclovir, is undergoing clinical development for the treatment and suppression of herpesviral diseases. Valacyclovir is frequently prescribed to the elderly to treat diseases such as herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Over the past two decades, the treatment of these conditions has been transformed by guanosine nucleoside antivirals such as valacyclovir (Valtrex, a highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax, and famciclovir (Famvir), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir).<br><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: We describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and other viral infections.

5a7486a90384be9551000003	Which molecules are inhibited by anticancer drug Dovitinib?	Dovitinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with FGFR pathway-amplified breast cancer. Dovitinib inhibits multiple tyrosine receptor kinases, predominantly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), but also FGFRs, and could be active in MPM. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. Dovitinib, a suppressor of FGFR activity, may be active in ACC. We tested dovitinib, an inhibitor of both FGF and VEGF receptors, in patients progressing on anti-VEGF treatment. Five HNSCC cell lines were characterized based on VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression by sqRT-PCR and treated with three different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nintedanib, dovitinib and pazopanib), all of which are effective against VEGFR and FGFR family members. PURPOSE: Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR.  .RESULTS: Four trials involving the selective VEGFR inhibitors axitinib, tivozanib and dovitinib were analysed, all using sorafenib as the comparator.  PURPOSE: Dovitinib (TKI258) is an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR Î², and c-Kit.  Using this PDX model, we confirmed the ability of the FGFR inhibitors, ponatinib, dovitinib and BGJ398, to modulate FGFR signaling, inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma tumors harboring FGFR2 fusions. In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, dovitinib inhibits FGFR.  AZD4547, BGJ398 (infigratinib), Debio-1347 and dovitinib are FGFR1/2/3 inhibitors; BLU9931 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor; FIIN-2, JNJ-42756493, LY2874455 and ponatinib are pan-FGFR inhibitors. AZD4547, dovitinib and ponatinib are multi-kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs, colony stimulating factorÂ 1 receptorÂ (CSF1R), vascular endothelial growth factorÂ (VEGF)R2, and others.  In vitro, N87-TR cell lines demonstrated a higher sensitivity than did trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to the FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which reduced expression of pAKT, ZEB1, and cell migration. The current phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of dovitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced SCC of the lung. Dovitinib (TKI258) is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor currently in clinical phase I/II/III development for the treatment of various types of cancers.  We tested various T-ALL cell lines against a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 66 compounds targeting two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome and found that combined treatment of T-ALL cells with dovitinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and OP449 synergistically reduced the viability of all tested T-ALL cell lines.  We sought to identify fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib, and explore the mechanism of action of the drug-resistant mutations. Dovitinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î², Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, c-Kit and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1-3. Dovitinib (TKI258/CHIR258) is a multi-kinase inhibitor in phase III development for the treatment of several cancers. INTRODUCTION Erlotinib is a FDA approved small molecule inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and dovitinib is a novel small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of 2 FGFR inhibitors, the multikinase inhibitor dovitinib (TKI258) and the more selective FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398 for the treatment of endometrial cancer. PURPOSE Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR. The multiple kinase inhibitor dovitinib is currently under clinical investigation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).	[['VEGFR'], ['FGFR'], ['PDGFR'], ['KIT']]
52f89fd32059c6d71c000051	List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.	Our work describes, for the first time, distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9.  Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis.  LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and down regulates the expression of GPA. We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1. At other differentiation stages, additional combinatorial interactions occurred between RUNX1 and its coregulators, GATA1 and ETS.  Ldb1, a ubiquitously expressed LIM domain binding protein, is essential in a number of tissues during development. It interacts with Gata1, Tal1, E2A and Lmo2 to form a transcription factor complex regulating late erythroid genes.  Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. Here we show that Ski interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block erythroid differentiation.  The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1.  tudies involving point mutants of GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

530cf4e0c8a0b4a00c000005	Which are the cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome?	Cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome include aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue. Aortic root dilation is a main criterion of the Ghent Nosology. Dural ectasia and the presence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) contribute to its systemic score. The typical cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome are aortic regurgitation with progressive dilatation of the aortic root, which may cause dissection and rupture of the ascending aorta, mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve regurgitation.

Selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) generates the selenium donor for selenocysteine biosynthesis in eubacteria. One homologue of SelD in eukaryotes is SPS1 (selenophosphate synthetase 1) and a second one, SPS2, was identified as a selenoprotein in mammals.

5a86ebf2faa1ab7d2e000038	Which are the main transcriptional activators of circadian oscillations?	Mammalian CLOCK and BMAL1 are two members of bHLH-PAS-containing family of transcription factors that represent the positive elements of circadian autoregulatory feedback loop.  We have examined abundance, posttranslational modifications, cellular localization of endogenous and ectopically expressed CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins. Nuclear/cytoplasm distribution of CLOCK was found to be under circadian regulation. Formation of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex following ectopic coexpression of both proteins is followed by their codependent phosphorylation, which is tightly coupled to CLOCK nuclear translocation and degradation Altogether, these results provide evidence for an additional level of circadian system control, which is based on regulation of transcriptional activity or/and availability of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex.  Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG). Circadian rhythms in mammals are generated by a transcriptional negative feedback loop that is driven primarily by oscillations of PER and CRY, which inhibit their own transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1. Our biochemical evidence supports an elegant mechanism for the disparity: PER2 directly and rhythmically binds to CLOCK:BMAL1, while CRY only interacts indirectly; PER2 bridges CRY and CLOCK:BMAL1 to drive the circadian negative feedback loop.<br> Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG).

5523f1a62c8b63434a000002	Which mutations of phopspholamban have been found in patients with cardiomyopathy?	 In 19 of 142 patients (13%), the PLN founder mutation c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) was identified. PLN mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (pÂ = 0.004), inverted T waves in leads V4 to V6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (pÂ = 0.007) or functional (pÂ = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities. Recently, we showed that the c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) mutation in the phospholamban (PLN) gene can be identified in 10-15Â % of Dutch patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients.  The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC. R14del+ patients diagnosed with DCM showed an arrhythmogenic phenotype, and SCD at young age can be the presenting symptom. These findings support the concept of 'arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy'. Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse. Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart failure has been conducted. Two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L). One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). The fourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop). The genetic analysis was focused on R9C mutation with the ability to block PLN phosphorylation leading to chronic inhibition of SERCA2a activity. Another analysed mutation causing the alteration of PLN level in cells was related to the substitution of a leucine residue at position 39 with a premature stop codon (L39X).  A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death.  These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant.  We identified 1 family with a deletion of arginine 14 in the PLN. Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic with congestive heart failure.  Phospholamban R14 deletion results in late-onset, mild, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No homozygous individuals were identified. By middle age, heterozygous individuals developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases. Transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death. A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy. Here, a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. The heterozygous individuals exhibited hypertrophy without diminished contractile performance. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27.  Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes.

58b6d6f322d300530900000f	What is the inheritance of hypophosphatemic rickets?	Among 35 candidate genes in this region, the dentin matrix protein 1 gene (DMP1) was sequenced to reveal a nonsense mutation 250C/T on exon 6.  Previous research has shown that mutations in the DMP1 gene are responsible for autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets in humans. A novel nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene in a Japanese family with autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets. Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia resulting from renal phosphate wasting.  Prenatal diagnosis for a novel splice mutation of PHEX gene in a large Han Chinese family affected with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of heritable rickets characterized by X-linked dominant inheritance, renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and defective bone mineralization. Molecular analysis of DMP1 mutants causing autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets. We previously demonstrated that the mutations Met1Val (M1V) and the deletion of nucleotides 1484-1490 (1484-1490del) in Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) cause the novel disorder autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), which is associated with elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). First, we examined a kindred with a severe hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype and recessive inheritance.  Discordance for X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets in identical twin girls. We report monozygotic twin girls with a family history consistent with X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets (XLH).  Microsatellite analysis was performed to confirm monozygosity and bi-parental inheritance of the X chromosome.  Hypophosphatemia due to isolated renal phosphate wasting is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Two new genes linked to two different forms of hereditary hypophosphatemias have recently been described. Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. Somatic and germline mosaicism for a mutation of the PHEX gene can lead to genetic transmission of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets that mimics an autosomal dominant trait. Familial hypophosphatemic rickets is usually transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder (XLH), although autosomal dominant forms have also been observed. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively. Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait.  Somatic and germline mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal dominant inheritance. We report two cases of x-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets involving a man and his daughter.  X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets--a report of 2 cases and review of literature. The study of this family tree strongly suggests an x-linked dominant inheritance. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia: clinical characterization of a novel renal phosphate-wasting disorder. We performed clinical and biochemical evaluations of individuals from a large kindred with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia.  In conclusion, autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is an inherited disorder of isolated renal phosphate wasting.  [Scriver type autosomal hypophosphatemic rachitis: a family case]. A familial observation of hypophosphatemic rickets with unusual inheritance and evolution, different from that of X linked hypophosphatemia, is reported.  This observation is quite similar to the 'autosomal hypophosphatemic bone disease' described by Scriver et al.

Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. In addition, such CLCN5 mutations that would result in a functional loss have also been demonstrated in Japanese children with idiopathic low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and an Italian kindred with X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (XLRH) and hypercalciuria. Inactivating mutations of phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome, dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1, and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 are associated with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 1, and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 2, respectively. The objective of the study was to describe the molecular genetic findings in a family affected by hypophosphatemic rickets with presumed autosomal dominant inheritance. The HHRH is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance and is an extremely rare form of hypophosphatemic rickets. X-linked familial hypophosphatemic rickets (X.L.F.H.R.) is one of the D resistant rickets. Iron deficiency may affect autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype by regulating FGF23 production.Current treatment with activated vitamin D metabolites and oral inorganic phosphate salts may partially correct skeletal lesions and linear growth in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets.

51595fb0d24251bc0500009c	Proteomic analyses have revealed proteins associated with the triple-negative breast cancers. List some proposed proteins.	Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. We present here our results, including a large cumulative database of proteins based on the analysis of 78 TNBCs, and the identification and validation of one specific protein, Mage-A4, which was expressed in a significant fraction of TNBC and Her2-positive/ER negative lesions. Proteomic profiling of triple-negative breast carcinomas in combination with a three-tier orthogonal technology approach identifies Mage-A4 as potential therapeutic target in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Further, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic and gene array analyses of these cells and identified potential novel markers of breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating features, such as lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), RAB25, S100A14 and mucin 1 (MUC1), as well as a novel 31-gene signature capable of predicting distant metastasis in cohorts of estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancers. he results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC. We obtained differential expression patterns for several glycolytic enzymes (as for example MDH2, PGK1, TKT, Aldolase1), cytokeratins (CK7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19), further structure proteins (vimentin, fibronectin, L-plastin), for NME1-NME2, lactoferrin, and members of the Annexin family. he expression of calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer. Proteomic analysis also identified high levels of IDH2 and CRABP2 and low levels of SEC14L2 to be prognostic markers for overall breast cancer survival. Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that alpha-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR. The expression of a selected group of high abundance and/or breast cancer-specific potential biomarkers including thromobospondin 1, galectin-3 binding protein, cathepsin D, vimentin, zinc-Î±2-glycoprotein, CD44, and EGFR from the breast cancer cell lines and in their culture media were further validated by Western blot analysis. his provided novel evidence for PMA regulation of the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleolar RNA helicase 2 and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G(2)-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-kappaB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential.

Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within theâ>80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (Pâ=â0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (Pâ=â0.0005 and Pâ=â0.0033).

5a86c938faa1ab7d2e000034	Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?	The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2]. There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression Plant Stress Tolerance Requires Auxin-Sensitive Aux/IAA Transcriptional Repressors Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes in response to abiotic stress.  Here, we systematically dissect auxin sensing by SCFTIR1-IAA6 and SCFTIR1-IAA19 co-receptor complexes, and assess IAA6/IAA19 ubiquitylation in vitro and IAA6/IAA19 degradation in vivo. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Auxin-induced, SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination marks AUX/IAA proteins for degradation. evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1). Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking The tomato Aux/IAA transcription factor IAA9 is involved in fruit development and leaf morphogenesis We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3 The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays. AUX/IAA proteins are active repressors, and their stability and activity are modulated by auxin. The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2].

Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Aux/IAA family, shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin-dependent transcription.

regulate organogenesis growth and environmental response here we describe a screen for transcription factors tfs that regulate the aux iaa genes we identify tfs from 38 families including 26 members of the dreb cbf family several dreb cbf tfs directly promote transcription of the iaa5 and iaa19 genes in response to abiotic stress recessive mutations in these iaa genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network grn through transcription of the aux iaa genes we propose that the aux iaa genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or physiological outcome. auxin is a central hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth including the development of roots shoots flowers and fruit the perception and signaling of the plant hormone auxin rely on the cooperative action of several components among which auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa proteins play a pivotal role in this study we identified and comprehensively analyzed the entire aux iaa gene family in tomato solanum lycopersicum a reference species for solanaceae plants and the model plant for fleshy fruit development functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato aux iaa proteins function as active repressors of auxin dependent gene transcription with however different aux iaa members displaying varying levels of repression phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aux iaa gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with arabidopsis with a lower representation of non canonical proteins sl iaa genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene suggesting that aux iaas may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways the data presented here shed more light on sl iaa genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross talk. the aux iaa genes encode a large family of short lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants functional characterization of sliaa15 a member of the tomato solanum lycopersicum aux iaa family shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin dependent transcription the physiological significance of sliaa15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach revealing that sliaa15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes the sliaa15 down regulated lines display lower trichome number reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set moreover the leaves of sliaa15 inhibited plants are dark green and thick with larger pavement cells longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells the sliaa15 suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type i v and vi trichome formation suggesting that auxin dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation concomitant with reduced trichome formation the expression of some r2r3 myb genes putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation is altered these phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for aux iaas in plant developmental processes clearly indicating that members of the aux iaa gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific functions. auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation phototropism root fruit and embryo development auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling however many studies focus on aux arf gene families and much less is known about the aux iaa gene family in brassica rapa b rapa here we performed a comprehensive genome wide analysis and identified 55 aux iaa genes in b rapa using four conserved motifs of aux iaa family pf02309 chromosomal mapping of the b rapa aux iaa briaa genes facilitated understanding cluster rearrangement of the crucifer building blocks in the genome phylogenetic analysis of briaa with arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa and zea mays identified 51 sister pairs including 15 same species briaa briaa and 36 cross species briaa atiaa iaa genes among the 55 briaa genes expression of 43 and 45 genes were verified using genebank b rapa ests and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of chiifu and rcbr lines despite their huge morphological difference tissue specific expression analysis of briaa genes between the parental lines chiifu and rcbr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud flower and siliqua development stages the response of the briaa genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response single nucleotide polymorphisms between iaa genes of reference genome chiifu and rcbr were focused and identified our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of aux iaa genes and their structures in b rapa analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b rapa. the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development this largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression the aux iaa genes are best characterized among the early auxin responsive genes which encode short lived transcriptional repressors in most plants examined including arabidopsis soybean and rice the aux iaa genes constitute a large gene family by screening the available databases at least 15 expressed sequence tags ests have been identified from wheat triticum aestivum which exhibit high sequence identity with aux iaa homologues in other species one of these aux iaa genes taiaa1 harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the aux iaa proteins has been characterized in detail the expression of taiaa1 is light sensitive tissue specific and is induced within 15 30 min of exogenous auxin application also the taiaa1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation ca 2 and this effect is reversed by the calcium chelating agent egta the taiaa1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide in addition to auxin the taiaa1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development. auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development the auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa genes encode short lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the transport inhibitor response1 auxin receptor f box proteins the aux iaa proteins regulate auxin mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the auxin response factor protein family aux iaa function is poorly understood herein we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 aux iaa family members the mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type double or triple mutants of closely related aux iaa genes such as iaa8 1 iaa9 1 or iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 also exhibit wild type phenotypes global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin treated and untreated light grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17 6 and iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 mutants by contrast similar analysis with the gain of function axr3 1 iaa17 1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin induced gene expression compared with the wild type expression of several type a arabidopsis response regulator genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3 1 iaa17 1 the data suggest extensive functional redundancy among aux iaa gene family members and that enhanced stability of the axr3 iaa17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype resulting in developmental defects. the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil. auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes. recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.

5306158358348c0f52000001	Which genetic defects are observed in Prader-Willi syndrome?	Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disease caused by lack of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder caused by genetic defects in certain regions of chromosome 15q11-13. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an example of a human genetic disorder that involves imprinting genes on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 and SNRPN gene as a candidate gene for this syndrome. Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. The predominant genetic defects in PW are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy. In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-13 loci. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by absence of a paternal contribution of the chromosome region 15q11-q13, resulting from paternal deletions, maternal uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting mutations. Because methylation analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS. The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 15q11-q13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy (UPD). In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene. The genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) map to 15q11-13.

In vitro, loss-of-function experiments showed circ-ABCB10 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

5c544c1707647bbc4b000003	List uniparental disomy (UPD) detection algorithms	UPDtool: a tool for detection of iso- and heterodisomy in parent-child trios using SNP microarrays. UPDtool is a computational tool for detection and classification of uniparental disomy (UPD) in trio SNP-microarray experiments. The performance of the new algorithm, called "AsCNAR" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity of cancer genomes and should contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of human cancers. Our results were compared with both the gold standard, microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for UPD detection.

5a99566e1d1251d03b00000f	With which personality traits has the human monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene been associated?	Association of monoamine oxidase-A genetic variants and amygdala morphology in violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder and high psychopathic traits. The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations Monoamine Oxidase-A Genetic Variants and Childhood Abuse Predict Impulsiveness in Borderline Personality Disorder.  These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD. Elevated Monoamine Oxidase-A Distribution Volume in Borderline Personality Disorder Is Associated With Severity Across Mood Symptoms, Suicidality, and Cognition. These results suggest that elevated MAO-A VT is associated with multiple indicators of BPD severity, including BPD symptomatology, mood symptoms, suicidality, and neurocognitive impairment. No association between a polymorphism in the promoter region of the MAOA gene with antisocial personality traits in alcoholics. Taken together, these findings suggest that the three-repeat allele of the MAOAuVNTR 30-bp polymorphism is not associated with impulsive and aggressive personality traits. Different allele distribution of a regulatory MAOA gene promoter polymorphism in antisocial and anxious-depressive alcoholics The present study tested whether a novel functional polymorphism in the promotor region of the X-chromosomal monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) was related to antisocial and anxious-depressive traits in alcoholics. aken together, these findings suggest that the 3-repeat allele of the MAOA polymorphism contributes modestly to the dimension of overand underreactive behaviors as possible antecedents of alcoholism. Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males.  A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been shown to moderate the impact of maltreatment on antisocial behaviour. Non-linear interactions between the MAOA gene and violence were detected, suggesting that the genetic moderation may come about once a certain level of violence is experienced The history of research on the association between platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and personality traits, such as sensation seeking and impulsiveness, is reviewed.  Monoamine oxidase a gene is associated with borderline personality disorder. As for its role in aggression, impulsivity, suicide and mood liability, monoamine oxidase A can be considered a functional candidate in borderline personality disorder. These results show that the monoamine oxidase A gene may play an important role in the etiological development of the borderline personality disorder. Gene environment interactions with a novel variable Monoamine Oxidase A transcriptional enhancer are associated with antisocial personality disorder. However, clinical associations between this VNTR genotype and behavioral states have been inconsistent.  Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter methylation and transcriptional downregulation in an offender population with antisocial personality disorder. hese results are consistent with prior literature suggesting MAOA and serotonergic dysregulation in antisocial populations. Our results offer the first evidence suggesting epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to MAOA dysregulation in antisocial offenders. For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans. Allelic variation of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been implicated in conduct disorder and antisocial, aggressive behavior in humans when associated with early adverse experiences. By conferring allele-specific transcriptional activity on the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence [(variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR)] in the MAOA promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Genotypes with three-repeat alleles were reported to be associated with antisocial as well as impulsive traits. Platelet MAO-B activity has been associated with psychopathy- and aggression-related personality traits, while variants of the MAOA and MAOB genes have been associated with diverse clinical phenotypes, including aggressiveness, antisocial problems and violent delinquency. Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. CONCLUSION Taken together, these findings suggest that the MAOA-L genotype is to some extent associated with impulsive and antisocial personality traits in alcoholic men.

54f9d3eedd3fc62544000004	Which proteins participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex?	Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a Ca(2+) storage protein that interacts with triadin (TRN), the ryanodine receptor (RyR), and junctin (JUN) to form a macromolecular tetrameric Ca(2+) signaling complex in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The decrease of CASQ2 is associated with a reduction in the levels of Triadin (TrD) and Junctin (JnC), two proteins that form, with CASQ2 and RyR2, a macromolecular complex devoted to control of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Triadin and junctin are integral sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form a macromolecular complex with the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) but their roles in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.  In cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). By binding directly the RyR and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins. Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin.  Junctin is a transmembrane protein of the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin 1. This quaternary protein complex is thought to facilitate SR Ca2+ release. In mammalian striated muscles, ryanodine receptor (RyR), triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin form a quaternary complex in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Such intermolecular interactions contribute not only to the passive buffering of sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, but also to the active Ca2+ release process during excitation-contraction coupling.  Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.  Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin. Several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for Ca2+ release. These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor.  Taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca2+ release. Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin. Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.

5c645313e842deac67000019	What are the effects of the deletion of all three Pcdh clusters (tricluster deletion) in mice?	Multicluster Pcdh diversity is required for mouse olfactory neural circuit assembly. The vertebrate clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) cell surface proteins are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (PcdhÎ±, PcdhÎ², and PcdhÎ³). Here, we show that all three gene clusters functionally cooperate to provide individual mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with the cell surface diversity required for their assembly into distinct glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Although deletion of individual Pcdh clusters had subtle phenotypic consequences, the loss of all three clusters (tricluster deletion) led to a severe axonal arborization defect and loss of self-avoidance.

515deafd298dcd4e51000025	List the endoscopic diagnoses that have been reported in children with autism	Autism and esophageal achalasia in childhood: a possible correlation? In the last case, a 15-year-old male underwent barium swallow and endoscopy that confirmed achalasia. Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children. A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation. Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls. METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69.4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24. The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration. Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea. Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients. The observed increase in pancreatico-biliary secretion after secretin infusion suggests an upregulation of secretin receptors in the pancreas and liver. three children with autistic spectrum disorders who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and intravenous administration of secretin to stimulate pancreaticobiliary secretion.

Our data reveal another mechanism through which KB-R7943 may protect against calcium-induced injury, as well as a novel means to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. KB-R7943, a plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, blocks opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) regulator, also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and H2O2.  Unlike pyrrophenone, the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and CsA blocked cell death and arachidonic acid release not by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake but by inhibiting MPTP formation. Incubation with Î²3AR agonist (BRL37344, 7Â Î¼mol/L) significantly reduced cell death in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation and decreased susceptibility to deleterious opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), via a mechanism dependent on the Akt-NO signaling pathway.  Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D. Indeed, (i) permeability transition pore inhibition by antamanide is not additive with the cyclophilin D-binding drug cyclosporin A, (ii) the inhibitory action of antamanide on the pore requires phosphate, as previously shown for cyclosporin A; (iii) antamanide is ineffective in mitochondria or cells derived from cyclophilin D null animals, and (iv) abolishes CyP-D peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Furthermore, in wild-type (non-transfected) SHSY5Y cells, the effects of lactacystin on mitochondrial function and cell viability are also prevented by cyclosporin A (1Â Î¼M) which blocks the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore Exogenous zinc protects cardiac cells from reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Bradykinin prevents reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. HIF-1 reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the heart by targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Preâtreatment of gallic acid and mitochondrially targeted gallic acid to sodium nitroprusside treated mitochondria not only significantly reduced the oxidative stress but also prevented mitochondrial permeability pore transition to a significant difference. Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid. Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid. We conclude that mitochondrially targeted gallic acid can be used for preventing mitochondrial impairment caused by oxidative stress. The involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore was determined with a mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside and a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A. Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D.

Pro-Q Diamond stain Quantitative proteome analyses suggest that the well-established stain colloidal Coomassie Blue, when used as an infrared dye, may provide sensitive, post-electrophoretic in-gel protein detection that can rival even Sypro Ruby. Several new fast staining protocols for the visualization of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE utilizing Coomassie Blue staining (CBS) have been described in literature.  The CyDye family of fluorescent dyes is currently the overwhelming choice for applications in proteomic analysis, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) his enables the co-detection of phosphoproteins as well as total proteins from the same gel and is accomplished by utilizing two different fluorescent stains, the ProQ-Diamond, which stains only phosphorylated proteins, and Sypro Ruby, which stains the entire subset of proteins. Detection of the resulting protein maps relies on staining (i.e. colloidal coomassie blue (CCB) or SYPRO Ruby (SR), in addition to many others). Fluorescent in-gel protein stains are generally preferred for higher sensitivity, reduced background, and wider dynamic range. Commonly used staining methods with excellent mass spectrometry compatibility are coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) or fluorescent dyes. The typical concentration of protein loaded varies from 0.13 to 1.40 Î¼g/Î¼L for a classical silver staining method in 2DE gel Silver staining is widely used to detect protein in polyacrylamide gels when high sensitivity is required.

58eb2887eda5a57672000003	Which NGS alignment software implement the Burrows-Wheeler Transform?	For the human genome, Burrows-Wheeler indexing allows Bowtie to align more than 25 million reads per CPU hour with a memory footprint of approximately 1.3 gigabytes. Bowtie extends previous Burrows-Wheeler techniques with a novel quality-aware backtracking algorithm that permits mismatches. We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. SOAP2 is a significantly improved version of the short oligonucleotide alignment program that both reduces computer memory usage and increases alignment speed at an unprecedented rate. We used a Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT) compression index to substitute the seed strategy for indexing the reference sequence in the main memory. We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. Here, we propose a new base-calling algorithm, TotalReCaller, to achieve improved performance. A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. To tackle this problem, a new alignment tool BWBBLE is introduced in this article. We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome. Seed-based algorithms are generally slow but robust, while Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based algorithms are fast but less robust. To have both advantages, we developed an algorithm FANSe2 with iterative mapping strategy based on the statistics of real-world sequencing error distribution to substantially accelerate the mapping without compromising the accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment. In this paper, we propose a BWA-MT tool, evolved from BWA but supporting multi-thread computation, designed to fully utilize the underlying multi-core architecture of computing resources. By using multi-thread computation, BWA-MT can significantly shorten the time needed to generate an alignment for single-end read sequences. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps Although the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment steps We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. Although the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment steps.

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) share similar characteristics with respect to clinical signs, etiology, and transmission Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) can be divided into low pathogenic and highly pathogenic coronaviruses. The low pathogenic CoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness. In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumon In the last 15 years, we have witnessed the emergence of two zoonotic, highly pathogenic HCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). First identified in 2012 , Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) is caused by an emerging human coronavirus , which is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV) , and represents a novel member of the lineage C betacoronoviruses The virus was termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is taken notice of important coronavirus caused severe diseases to human after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans.

5506eca18e1671127b00000f	Which are the subunits of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the canonical pathway activation?	In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 UL42 protein, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, was a novel antagonism of the canonical NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-Î± mediated NF-ÎºB activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-ÎºB subunits p65 and p50.  Thus, it was first time we demonstrated that HSV-1 UL42 appeared to prevent NF-ÎºB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 and p50 in the cytoplasm, and UL42-dependent transcriptional activation were inherently coupled to promote HSV-1 lytic replication, which also may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1. The review describes NF-ÎºB and its two pathways: the canonical, mediated by the p65 and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical, mediated by the subunits RelB, p52 and p50.  The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has not yet been established. In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation. Herpes simplex virus 1 DNA polymerase processivity factor UL42 inhibits TNF-Î±-induced NF-ÎºB activation by interacting with p65/RelA and p50/NF-ÎºB1.	[['p65', 'RelA'], ['p50', 'NF-ÎºB1']]

52bf1cb303868f1b0600000b	What hand deformities do patients with Apert syndrome present with?	Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome. In patients with Apert syndrome, the hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures. These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space. The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions and the neurovascular bundles.  Two of the patients had Apert syndrome (syndromic craniosynostosis with symmetrical syndactyly) and two had polydactyly.  The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle syndactyly mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed. In these 10 patients, a total of 53 web spaces were released, 49 of which involved osteotomies for complex syndactyly.  Apert syndrome, characterised by craniosynostosis, craniofacial anomalies, and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits (cutaneous and bony fusion), has been associated with two canonical mutations in the FGFR2 gene (S252W, P253R) in the great majority of cases.  The Apert syndrome hand demonstrates many typical clinical features including syndactyly, symbrachyphalangism, and growth disturbances. In Apert syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals.  urgical correction of syndactyly of the Apert hand should begin by 6 months and be completed by 3 years of age. As much surgery as possible is carried out at each sitting.  The syndactyly cases were more complicated than the average, among them 4 cases of Apert syndrome were noted.

51477de5d24251bc05000020	Tumors of which three organs are classically associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome?	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1; formerly known as Wermer syndrome) is a rare disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of two or more tumors involving parathyroid, pancreatic islets and anterior pituitary glands; some other tumors have also been described.  Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 (95% of patients), pancreatic islet tumors or pancreatic NET (neuroendocrine tumor) occur in 40-70% and pituitary tumors in 30-40% of MEN 1 patients  In addition, other tumors, such as adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, lipomas, angiofibromas, colagenomas and meningiomas may be present.  the most important causes malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and thymic carcinoids.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predisposes to the development of hyperplastic or neoplastic changes in the parathyroid and pituitary glands and the endocrine pancreas, along with numerous other characteristic tumors and features.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of parathyroid and adrenocortical tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas and pituitary.  The pancreatic NETs are predominantly gastrinomas and insulinomas, and the pituitary NETs are mostly prolactinomas and somatotrophinomas.  We address the potential role of miRNAs in the endocrine pancreas, the pituitary gland, and the parathyroid glands-areas where MEN 1 shows high penetrance.  Moreover, studies have provided evidence that dysregulation of miRNAs was responsible for endocrine carcinogenesis, including pancreatic, pituitary, and parathyroid tumors. MEN1 and MEN2 are rare inherited cancer syndromes which express a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome predisposing to tumor development in several endocrine organs.  Its major manifestations include hyperparathyroidism, tumors of endocrine pancreas and pituitary.  eside these three, several other endocrine (adrenocortical, foregut carcinoid) and nonendocrine (lipoma, angiofibroma, collagenoma, ependymoma, meningioma) tumors have been described to be associated with this syndrome Both familial and sporadic forms of the disease are known. The diagnosis of MEN1 can be established if two of the three major manifestations are found in the same patient, whereas the diagnosis of familial MEN1 requires one MEN1 patient and a first degree relative with at least one MEN1 manifestation.  Both benign (parathyroid, anterior pituitary) and malignant (gastrinoma, glucagonoma) lesions may develop in MEN1 patients Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a classic hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by a genetic predisposition to develop a variety of neuroendocrine neoplasias and hormone excess syndromes. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a familial syndrome characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic and pituitary tumors.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome characterized by the development of multiple endocrine tumors Multiple facial angiofibromas were observed in 28 (88%) of the patients with MEN1, with 16 patients (50%) having 5 or more. Angiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis. Collagenomas were observed in 23 patients (72%). Also observed were cafe au lait macules in 12 patients (38%), lipomas in 11 patients (34%), confetti-like hypopigmented macules in 2 patients (6%), and multiple gingival papules in 2 patients (6%) Multiple angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, confetti-like hypopigmented macules and multiple gingival papules are cutaneous manifestations of MEN1 and should be looked for in both family members of patients with MEN1 and individuals with hyperparathyroidism of other MEN1-associated tumors.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by nodular proliferation of the parathyroid glands and tumors of the anterior pituitary gland, the endocrine pancreas, and the neuroendocrine cell system of the gut. We report here a genetic study of a female MEN1 patient with the association of nodular hyperplasia of two parathyroid glands, an insulinoma, multiple duodenal gastrinomas, a prolactinoma, and a gastric carcinoid. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is defined clinically by the combined occurrence of multiple tumors, typically of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary gland. In support of previous findings in islet tumors, we found down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulator, p18, in both the pancreatic islet and pituitary adenomas, suggesting that reduced p18 levels may be important for Men1-related tumorigenesis in multiple tissues. Surprisingly, we identified increased p16 transcript in pancreatic islet and pituitary tumors.   The patient was studied and diagnosed with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), familiar (mother with MEN I). A scintigraphic study with 99mTc-MIBI was performed in order to localize hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands because of biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.  The tumor was removed and histologically confirmed as a carcinoid within a thymus in a MEN type I syndrome.  MEN I patients can benefit from the examination with this agent which can potentially localize not only parathyroid endocrine pathology but also unknown associated tumors. Pancreatic endocrine tumors occur sporadically and as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndromes.  We have analyzed 22 nonfamilial and 16 MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p, 11q13, and 18q. LOH at 3p was revealed in 45% and 36% of tumors from 31 patients with nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated disease, respectively. The data indicate involvement of tumor suppressor genes on 3p and 18q, in addition to the MEN1 gene at 11q13, in the tumorigenesis of both nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by the development of endocrine tumors of the parathyroid and pituitary glands, pancreas, and duodenum. Less frequently occurring tumors associated with MEN1 include non-endocrine tumors such as lipomas and angiofibromas.  An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms, leiomyomas, adrenal cortical hyperplasia, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and renal angiomyolipoma has been noted in the MEN1 population.  A germline mutation of the MEN1 gene was detected, and deletions of the MEN1 gene were consistently detected in multiple neuroendocrine tumors involving the parathyroid glands and the pancreas and a hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, as predicted by Knudson's "two hit" hypothesis. Two hits of the MEN1 gene were also detected in esophageal leiomyoma tissue, suggesting that tumorigenesis was directly related to the patient's underlying MEN1.  In contrast, follicular thyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and adrenal cortical hyperplasia consistently showed retained heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene with flanking markers and an intragenic marker. Therefore, these tumors appear to develop along pathogenetic pathways that are different from classical MEN1-associated tumors. Twelve unrelated (German MEN1 families and their associated tumors (5 parathyroid tumors, 1 vipoma, 1 gastrinoma, 1 insulinoma) were characterized for MEN1 gene mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and DNA sequence analysis as well as for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11q13.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) consists of benign, and sometimes malignant, tumors (often multiple in a tissue) of the parathyroids, enteropancreatic neuroendocrine system, anterior pituitary, and other tissues. Skin angiofibromas and skin collagenomas are common. 	[['parathyroid gland'], ['pancreas'], ['pituitary gland']]

530cefaaad0bf1360c000002	Which brain structures have been investigated as potential targets for deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression?	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under scientific evaluation as a new treatment option for these treatment-resistant patients. First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc).  New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials.  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) has antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The ventral striatum, including the head of the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens, is a putative target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depression (MD).  High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas. We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory major depression.  Functional inhibition of the lateral habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties. Because a prominent clinical feature of depression is anhedonia--the inability to experience pleasure from previously pleasurable activities--and because there is clear evidence of dysfunctions of the reward system in depression, DBS to the nucleus accumbens might offer a new possibility to target depressive symptomatology in otherwise treatment-resistant depression. These preliminary findings suggest that DBS to the nucleus accumbens might be a hypothesis-guided approach for refractory major depression. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral caudate nucleus markedly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety until their remission, which was achieved at 6 months after the start of stimulation (HDRS < or = 7 and HARS < or = 10). No neuropsychological deterioration was observed, indicating that DBS of the ventral caudate nucleus could be a promising strategy in the treatment of refractory cases of both OCD and major depression. Comparisons of clinical outcomes and anatomical data on electrode positioning showed that caudate nucleus stimulation preferentially alleviated OCD manifestations, whereas nucleus accumbens stimulation improved depressive symptoms.

The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin.  A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.  In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P(nom)â¤0.004, ORs 1.52 and 1.55), whereas, in the Greek sample, there was a trend for association to MAP2K5/SKOR1 and BTBD9  This is the first demonstration of a genetic influence on RLS in ESRD patients with BTBD9 being significantly associated. Four family members developed dopa-responsive dystonia, with onset in their late teens, and subsequently developed restless leg syndrome and migraine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an intragenic guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 duplication in a dopa-responsive dystonia family. To date, no gene mutation has been found, but five gene loci have been mapped in primary RLS to chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, and 20p (RLS1 through 5) We demonstrate linkage to a locus on chromosome 9p that is probably distinct from RLS3.

To discover novel RNAP inhibitors, a pharmacophore based on the alignment of described inhibitors was used for virtual screening. In an optimization process of hit compounds, novel derivatives with improved in vitro potency were discovered. Investigations concerning the molecular mechanism of RNAP inhibition reveal that they prevent the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between Ï(70) and the RNAP core enzyme. the primary structural features required for estrogen receptor binding, the phenols, are not required for inhibiting parasitic growth. Significantly, the most active antileishmanial benzothiophenes lack the pharmacophore for estrogen receptor activity and therefore address potential concerns about the undesirable effects of using selective estrogen receptor modulators in women and children with leishmaniasis.  series of novel diastereoisomeric Ï ligands 3 was designed, synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. The highly rigid [4.3.3]propellane scaffold was used to fix the three dimensional orientation of the pharmacophoric moieties required for Ï affinity This study was performed to identify natural iNOS inhibitors from traditional Chinese herbs through a combination of pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking and virtual screening. First, the pharmacophore models were generated though six known iNOS inhibitors and validated by a test database. The pharmacophore model_017 showed good performance in external validation and was employed to screen Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (Version 2009), which resulting in a hit list of 498 compounds with matching score (QFIT) above 40. Then, the hits were subjected to molecular docking for further refinement. An empirical scoring function was used to evaluate the affinity of the compounds and the target protein. Parts of compounds with high docking scores have been reported to have the related pharmacological activity from the literatures. Hit compound 8 was identified as an inhibitor of tankyrases through a combination of substructure searching of the Amgen compound collection based on a minimal binding pharmacophore hypothesis and high-throughput screening.

WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disease, named after its main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis, which refers to abnormal accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. The Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, Myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in chemokine receptor CXCR4. WHIM syndrome is a condition in which affected persons have chronic peripheral neutropenia, lymphopenia, abnormal susceptibility to human papilloma virus infection, and myelokathexis. Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by neutropenia, lymphopenia, susceptibility to infections, and myelokathexis, which describes degenerative changes of mature neutrophils and hyperplasia of bone marrow myeloid cells.  The WHIM syndrome features susceptibility to human Papillomavirus infection-induced warts and carcinomas, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections, B and T-cell lymphopenia, and neutropenia associated with retention of senescent neutrophils in the bone marrow (i.e. <b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</b>: WHIM syndrome (the association of warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections, and 'myelokathexis') is a rare congenital form of neutropenia associated with an unusual immune disorder involving hypogammaglonulinemia and abnormal susceptibility to warts.

54e061ee1388e8454a00000c	List two chemotherapeutic agents that are used for treatment of Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma	Everolimus has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), in combination with exemestane in advanced hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The effect of everolimus on renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: subgroup results from the randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial EXIST-1. Our objective was to evaluate everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in the treatment of angiomyolipoma in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC. METHODS: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 (NCT00789828), a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, examined everolimus in treating SEGA associated with TSC. Patients with serial SEGA growth from pre-baseline to baseline scans were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 4.5 mg/m(2)/day everolimus (target blood trough: 5-15 ng/mL; n = 78) or placebo (n = 39).  CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus showed efficacy in reducing angiomyolipoma lesion volume in patients with SEGA associated with TSC. Everolimus has demonstrated substantial clinical benefit in randomized, controlled, phase III studies leading to approval for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, advanced neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin, renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, as well as advanced hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative advanced breast cancer.  Everolimus for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma probably causing seizure aggravation in a child with tuberous sclerosis complex: a case report. We are reporting on a 13.5-year-old girl with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who was treated with everolimus because of giant cell astrocytoma and bilateral angiomyolipoma. Response of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with spinal cord metastasis to everolimus. BACKGROUND: Brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in patients with tuberous sclerosis have been reported to respond to everolimus.  CONCLUSIONS: We describe a rare case of metastatic SEGA, which was successfully treated with everolimus. Additional oncology indications for everolimus include renal angiomyolipoma with tuberous sclerosis complex and subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex, and, in combination with exemestane, for hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.  Long-term effect of everolimus on epilepsy and growth in children under 3 years of age treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. AIMS: To show the long-term safety data and the effect of everolimus treatment on epilepsy in children under the age of 3 who received everolimus for SEGAs associated with TSC.  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that everolimus is effective and safe in infants and young children with epilepsy and SEGA associated with TSC and offers a valuable treatment option. Everolimus long-term safety and efficacy in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. OBJECTIVE: To report long-term efficacy and safety data for everolimus for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). CONCLUSION: Everolimus therapy is safe and effective for longer term (median exposure 34.2 months) treatment of patients with TSC with SEGA. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that everolimus, titrated to trough serum levels of 5-15 ng/mL, was effective in reducing tumor size in patients with SEGA secondary to TSC for a median of 34 months. Everolimus (RAD001): first systemic treatment for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. In patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex who are not candidates for surgery, single-agent everolimus has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce SEGA volume with good tolerability. In the Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, everolimus was associated with a SEGA response rate of 35% compared with 0% in the placebo group.  Efficacy and safety of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (EXIST-1): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. In an open-label, phase 1/2 study, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus substantially and significantly reduced the volume of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. We assessed the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.  INTERPRETATION: These results support the use of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis. Everolimus for tumor recurrence after surgical resection for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. A recent phase 1/2 study demonstrated that treatment with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus reduced subependymal giant cell astrocytoma volume by 30% in 75% of the patients, all of whom were poor candidates for surgical resection.  All 4 experienced over 50% initial reduction in the volume of their subependymal giant cell astrocytoma after 2 to 3 years of therapy with everolimus. METHODS: Recently, a phase I/II trial of everolimus demonstrated significant reductions in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) volume and decreased seizure frequency. TSC patients with SEGA received everolimus, titrated to tolerability to achieve target trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. Everolimus: in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Everolimus is an orally administered inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Everolimus (starting dosage 3.0âmg/m(2)) was associated with a significant reduction in the volume of the largest subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in 28 patients aged â¥3 years with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in a phase II trial (C2485).  During the extension phase of this trial (median duration 34 months), the reduction in SEGA volume was maintained, with no everolimus recipient requiring surgery or other therapy for SEGA or hydrocephalus.  Effective everolimus treatment of inoperable, life-threatening subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and intractable epilepsy in a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex. We present successful everolimus treatment of a huge subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in a 10-year old boy with tuberous sclerosis complex.  Everolimus tablets for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Recently, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown encouraging benefit for patients with SEGAs.  The authors also examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for patients with inoperable SEGAs. EXPERT OPINION: Everolimus (Afinitor) selectively targets a molecular defect of SEGAs in TSC patients. Everolimus for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis. An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%).  CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus therapy was associated with marked reduction in the volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and seizure frequency and may be a potential alternative to neurosurgical resection in some cases, though long-term studies are needed. The authors present a 21-year-old woman who has been receiving rapamycin for 5 months for bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. We present successful everolimus treatment of a huge subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in a 10-year old boy with tuberous sclerosis complex. A recent phase 1/2 study demonstrated that treatment with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus reduced subependymal giant cell astrocytoma volume by 30% in 75% of the patients, all of whom were poor candidates for surgical resection. This review provides an overview of TSC, everolimus, and the clinical trials that led to its approval for the treatment of TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma. Everolimus in the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, angiomyolipomas, and pulmonary and skin lesions associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. In patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex who are not candidates for surgery, single-agent everolimus has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce SEGA volume with good tolerability The authors also examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for patients with inoperable SEGAs.

5abce6acfcf4565872000022	Please list 7 classes of drugs that interact with Warfarin.	The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs The number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil,   potential drug interaction exists between oral corticosteroids and warfarin, but there is limited documentation. Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction. We review the possible mechanisms of this interaction and the reported interactions between warfarin and other protease inhibitors. It is necessary to intensify warfarin monitoring upon initiation or alteration of hormonal contraceptives. To report a single patient case that presented with a probable drug interaction between warfarin and 3 methods of hormonal contraceptives, as assessed by the Horn Interaction Probability Scale. Warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults of an outpatient anticoagulation clinic Several classes of drugs, such as antibiotics, may interact with warfarin to cause an increase in warfarins anticoagulant activity and the clinical relevance of warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults is not clear. As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. The most commonly identified potentially interacting medication pairs were warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6824 cases), theophylline/aminophylline and ciprofloxacin/fluvoxamine (930), and warfarin and barbiturates (567). Among 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin, fluconazole, amiodarone, and omeprazole were associated with the requirement for 45.8, 16.7, and 16.7% lower median warfarin dose (all P<0.05 with a false discovery rate <0.05). The results demonstrate a high prevalence of concomitant drug prescriptions with the potential for clinically relevant DDIs with warfarin, the most frequent being acetylsalicylic acid and amiodarone We provide new support for the previous scarce evidence of interactions between warfarin and carbamazepine, bezafibrate, and lactulose.   Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. Of the antidepressants analyzed, those that showed relevant effects on the interaction with warfarin were, in decreasing order: paroxetine, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and duloxetine. Isomeric differences in metabolism form an important basis for stereoselective metabolic interactions, especially inhibition; this has been demonstrated with phenylbutazone, metronidazole and co-trimoxazole Miconazole and nystatin used as topical antifungal drugs interact equally strongly with warfarin. A retrospective case series published in 2012 concluded that miconazole and nystatin used as topical antifungal drugs appear to interact equally strongly with warfarin.  trazodone (2.2%) and carbamazepine (1.1%). The most commonly prescribed agents independently associated with increased bleeding risk were cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Metabolic interaction between warfarin and antiretrovirals is likely, particularly if NNRTIs or PIs are included in the antiretroviral regimen.

58a0da5278275d0c4a000054	For what indications is thalidomide currently marketed?	In this retrospective study, pharmacy claims were analyzed for those patients with a diagnosis of MM who received thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide from a large specialty pharmacy in the US between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a fatal systemic disorder associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and the overproduction of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Recently, the prognosis of POEMS was substantially improved by introduction of therapeutic intervention for myeloma. However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome Thalidomide could relieve clinical symptoms and intestinal mucosal lesions effectively in children with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the pre-clinical study. In reactional states of leprosy the use of thalidomide is established. The use of thalidomide was never discontinued in Brazil where it is prescribed for leprosy type 2 reaction. New uses of thalidomide. Currently, it is used for a few indications; in Brazil, where leprosy is endemic, thalidomide is used for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, and recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy have been reported.We analyzed the frequency of births with phenotypes consistent with thalidomide embryopathy (TEP) and correlated this with the distribution of thalidomide and the prevalence of leprosy between 2005 and 2010 in Brazil.A total of 5,889,210 thalidomide tablets were distributed; the prevalence of limb reduction defects was 1.60 (CI95%: 1.54-1.66) and TEP was 0.11 (CI95%: 0.10-0.13) per 10,000 births. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) To explore the inhibitory effect of thalidomide combined with interferon (IFN) on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi- 1 and its mechanism.The inhibitiory effect of Kasumi- 1 cells by thalidomide, interferon or combination was detected by CCK- 8 method, the apoptosis by flow cytometry, the expression of apoptosis related proteins by Western blot, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in culture supernatant by ELISA.Thalidomide inhibited the proliferation of Kasumi- 1 in a dose- dependent manner from 50 Î¼g/ml to 500 Î¼g/ml with an ICââ of (451. Interferon (INF)-Î± was the maintenance treatment of choice after autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma in the past, but currently Thalidomide is commonly used However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome, with an additional 48-week open-label safety study Thalidomide, mainly used for the treatment of leprosy, is a current teratogen in South America, and it is reasonable to assume that at present this situation is affecting many births in underdeveloped countries.  Currently, it is used for a few indications; in Brazil, where leprosy is endemic, thalidomide is used for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, and recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy have been reported.We analyzed the frequency of births with phenotypes consistent with thalidomide embryopathy (TEP) and correlated this with the distribution of thalidomide and the prevalence of leprosy between 2005 and 2010 in Brazil.A total of 5,889,210 thalidomide tablets were distributed; the prevalence of limb reduction defects was 1.60 (CI95%: 1.54-1.66) and TEP was 0.11 (CI95%: 0.10-0.13) A review of the therapeutic indications for thalidomide in dermatology as well as the mechanisms of action and side-effects of this drug are presented. Thalidomide first was marketed as a sedative in the 1950s and withdrawn from the market in 1961 following reports of teratogenicity. Later, it was used as an investigational agent for the treatment of Hansen's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, myelofibrosis, RAUs, and wasting associated with HIV. The drug has since been found effective for several different indications. Based on present publications we review indications of the therapy of dermatoses with thalidomide as well as possible mechanisms of action and side effects of this drug. Use of thalidomide in dermatological indications. Current data demonstrates that thalidomide is clinically promising in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme and renal cell cancer. Erythema nodosum leprosum is the only registered indication for the use of thalidomide in the United States of America. Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV. Gradually, thalidomide was reintroduced for the treatment of a few skin diseases including leprous erythema nodosum, severe mucosal ulcers (e.g., associated with HIV infection or BehÃ§et's disease), lymphocytic skin infiltrations, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic graft-versus-host disease Thalidomide has been used in several cutaneous inflammatory disorders (such as erythema nodosum leprosum in lepromatous leprosy, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe aphtosis), cancers (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) and inflammatory conditions. This drug was more recently rediscovered as a powerful immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory agent and was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum.  Since, however, it has been found to be an effective drug in erythema nodosum leprosum	[['Multiple myeloma'], ['polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein and skin changes', 'POEMS'], ['Irritable Bowels Syndrome ', 'IBS']]

52f4f1d62059c6d71c00001c	Which are the clinical characteristics of isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy?	Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder caused by the arrest of myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, leading to a non compacted endocardial layer with marked hypertrabeculation and deep recesses. The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 Â± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 Â± 10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved in all the cases. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 40%o. Prominent hypertrabecularisation (ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium >2) in the apical and mid left ventricular segments is typical for non-compaction cardiomyopathy.  Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during early embryogenesis. Sudden cardiac death (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40). LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, heart failure in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious sick sinus syndrome (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients.

58d8d8108acda34529000009	Which mutated genes are associated with isolated ectopia lentis?	A founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes early-onset bilateral ectopia lentis among Jews of Bukharian origin. The term isolated ectopia lentis (EL; subluxation or dislocation of the human crystalline lens) is applied to patients with EL, without skeletal features and in the absence of aortic root dilatation. To date, the only gene shown to cause autosomal-recessive isolated EL is ADAMTSL4. Here we report a novel founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 gene in children of Bukharian Jewish origin presenting with early-onset bilateral EL.  Early onset ectopia lentis due to a FBN1 mutation with non-penetrance. Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene.  In conclusion, we report on a case of early-onset autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis caused by FBN1 mutation that has previously been reported only in Marfan syndrome. ADAMTSL4-associated isolated ectopia lentis: Further patients, novel mutations and a detailed phenotype description. ADAMTSL4 mutations seem to be the most common cause of isolated ectoplia lentis (EL) and thus are important concerning the differential diagnosis of connective tissue syndromes with EL as main feature.  A genotype-phenotype comparison of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 in isolated ectopia lentis. To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene. A novel FBN1 mutation in a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis. To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis (EL) family. A novel mutation of FBN1 results in an arginine to cysteine residue (p.R974C) substitution, which is responsible for the patients with isolated EL in this Chinese family. A homozygous mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes autosomal-recessive isolated ectopia lentis. Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene. To examine the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene for mutations in members of a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis. Ophthalmic findings in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Craniosynostosis with ectopia lentis and a homozygous 20-base deletion in ADAMTSL4. ADAMTSL4-associated isolated ectopia lentis: Further patients, novel mutations and a detailed phenotype description Our study presented detailed clinical manifestations, including some novel ophthalmic findings, such as pupillary abnormality, different types of glaucoma, and progressive hyperopia.Ophthalmic findings and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of FBN1 gene were reported in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis To examine the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene for mutations in members of a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis.Clinically relevant laboratory investigation.Family members underwent clinical examinations Ophthalmic findings in a family with early-onset isolated ectopia lentis and the p.Arg62Cys mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) The 65 exons of FBN1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and direct DNA sequencing.A mutation, c.184C-->T in exon 2 of FBN1, which results in substitution of arginine by cysteine at position 62 of the fibrillin-1 protein (p.R62C) in all affected family members but in none of the unaffected individuals.A recurrent mutation of FBN1 gene resulted in an arginine-to-cysteine residue (p.R62C), is responsible for the patients with isolated ectopia lentis in a Chinese family Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the association of ADAMTSL4 null mutations with isolated ectopia lentis and the presence of a founder mutation in the European population.  Herein we show a consanguineous family that carries a novel homozygous splice mutation IVS4-1G>A/IVS4-1G>A in ADAMTSL4 responsible for isolated autosomal recessive EL, thus confirming the involvement of this gene in this condition and underlining the major role of ADAMTS proteases in zonular fibers homeostasis. Two novel FBN1 mutations associated with ectopia lentis and marfanoid habitus in two Chinese families. Novel FBN1 mutations associated with predominant ectopia lentis and marfanoid habitus in Chinese patients. FBN1 mutations are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes, including Marfan syndrome (MFS), MASS phenotype, and familial ectopia lentis, but rarely with isolated aortic aneurysm and dissection. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes.Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae.

5aaef38dfcf456587200000f	Please list 10 conditions which play a role in causing atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Multiple conditions like hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, sleep apnoea, and obesity play a role for the initiation and perpetuation of AF. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia worldwide with increasing frequency noted with age. Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation with a 16%-60% prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with known hyperthyroidism  Atrial fibrillation continues to be a challenging arrhythmia. There are some conventional, time-tested explanations of atrial fibrillation genesis, however some uncertainty of its complete understanding still exists. We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart disease The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. As the population ages, the burden of AF increases. t is estimated that this arrhythmia's suffers a significant increase throughout the entire life span, and that its highest raise occurs between the ages of 65 and 80.  Drug-induced tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmias with rapid ventricular response) are life-threatening and often cause syncope Atrial fibrillation is a growing health problem and the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of persons above the age of 65 years. It occurs very often in patients with congestive heart failure and the prevalence increases with the severity of the disease. The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation increase with age. Cardiac arrhythmias are a major problem in elderly persons, because of the high prevalence of underlying heart disease and hypertension, Heavy alcohol use has been suspected to cause acute atrial fibrillation, Heavy alcohol use is an important potential etiology for acute atrial fibrillation; alcohol withdrawal may represent a particular risk for such alcohol-related atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease has the highest stroke risk (about 17 times greater than unaffected controls), but even with nonvalvular heart disease, the risk is increased fivefold hronic atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia affecting 2 to 4% of the population older than 60 years of age In western countries ischemic and hypertensive heart disease (including sick sinus syndrome) and alcohol (holiday heart syndrome) are numerically more important than the classical causes of atrial fibrillation--rheumatic heart disease and thyrotoxicosis- Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease.   Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythm disorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in adult population  isk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease.   Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, coexisting cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and coexisting infection. Thus, pericarditis might play a role in the development of recent atrial fibrillation during the course of myocardial infarction. Recent atrial fibrillation may be a sign of pericardial effusion which may be otherwise silent. Some patients develop atrial fibrillation after any type of surgery, some patients develop atrial fibrillation only after cardiac surgery, and still other patients never develop postoperative atrial fibrillation Hypertension is known to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation Of the long list of various cardiac conditions associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic strokes, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cause.

52bf202003868f1b06000018	What are the main indications of lacosamide?	The current article presents a concise review of network theory and its application to the characterization of AED use in children with refractory epilepsy. Furthermore, first generation AEDs were often discontinued, while lacosamide and topiramate were most likely to be initiated.  Overall, there is compelling evidence that salivary TDM can be usefully applied so as to optimize the treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine, clobazam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and zonisamide. The first examples are carbamazepine, gabapentin, and lacosamide as drugs well established in epilepsy market as well as drug candidates such as valnoctamide, and other valproic acid derivatives, novel biphenyl pyrazole derivatives, etc. Two additional AEDs, lacosamide and eslicarbazepine acetate, have been licensed recently for a more traditional indication, refractory partial-onset seizures.  A discussion is made of recent findings that the atypical antidepressant tianeptine increases CRMP2 expression, whereas other, neuroactive small molecules including the epilepsy drug lacosamide and the natural brain metabolite lanthionine ketimine appear to bind CRMP2 directly with concomitant affects on neural structure. Lacosamide (LCM) is a newer antiepileptic drug with a dual mode of action.  It has shown potent and broad neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo animal models making it a potential candidate for long term treatment of epilepsy. In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models. Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety.  Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures. Lacosamide (LCM), (SPM 927, (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide, previously referred to as harkoseride or ADD 234037) is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized as anticonvulsive drug candidates. LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as chronic inflammatory pain. Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity. Currently, LCM is in a late stage of clinical development as an adjunctive treatment for patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and it is being assessed as monotherapy in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.  Lacosamide was effective against sound-induced seizures in the genetically susceptible Frings mouse, against maximal electroshock test (MES)-induced seizures in rats and mice, in the rat hippocampal kindling model of partial seizures, and in the 6Hz model of psychomotor seizures in mice. Lacosamide was inactive against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous administration of the chemoconvulsants pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, but it did inhibit NMDA-induced seizures in mice and showed full efficacy in the homocysteine model of epilepsy. These results suggest that lacosamide may have the potential to be clinically useful for at least the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic and partial-onset epilepsies, and support ongoing clinical trials in these indications.

5319a724b166e2b806000025	Which trinucleotide repeat disorders are affecting the nervous system?	The discovery that expansion of unstable repeats can cause a variety of neurological disorders has changed the landscape of disease-oriented research for several forms of mental retardation, Huntington disease, inherited ataxias, and muscular dystrophy. Expansion of trinucleotide repeats is now recognized as a major cause of neurological disease. At least seven disorders result from trinucleotide repeat expansion: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), two fragile X syndromes of mental retardation (FRAXA and FRAXE), myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Fragile X and myotonic dystrophy are multisystem disorders usually associated with large expansions of untranslated repeats, while the four neurodegenerative disorders, SBMA, Huntington's disease, SCA1, and DRPLA, are caused by smaller expansions of CAG repeats within the protein coding portion of the gene.

5c6c497d7c78d69471000036	Which tools have been developed for computing split-networks?	SPECTRE: a suite of phylogenetic tools for reticulate evolution. Split-networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that have proven to be a powerful tool in phylogenetics. Various ways have been developed for computing such networks, including split-decomposition, NeighborNet, QNet and FlatNJ. Some of these approaches are implemented in the user-friendly SplitsTree software package. However, to give the user the option to adjust and extend these approaches and to facilitate their integration into analysis pipelines, there is a need for robust, open-source implementations of associated data structures and algorithms. Here, we present SPECTRE, a readily available, open-source library of data structures written in Java, that comes complete with new implementations of several pre-published algorithms and a basic interactive graphical interface for visualizing planar split networks. SPECTRE also supports the use of longer running algorithms by providing command line interfaces, which can be executed on servers or in High Performance Computing environments. FlatNJ: a novel network-based approach to visualize evolutionary and biogeographical relationships. Split networks are a type of phylogenetic network that allow visualization of conflict in evolutionary data. We present a new method for constructing such networks called FlatNetJoining (FlatNJ). QNet: an agglomerative method for the construction of phylogenetic networks from weighted quartets. We present QNet, a method for constructing split networks from weighted quartet trees. QNet can be viewed as a quartet analogue of the distance-based Neighbor-Net (NNet) method for network construction. Just as NNet, QNet works by agglomeratively computing a collection of circular weighted splits of the taxa set which is subsequently represented by a planar split network.

56c33e5695c1e7cc5b000001	In which nuclear compartments is heterochromatin located?	This compartment localizes into three main regions: the peripheral heterochromatin, perinucleolar heterochromatin, and pericentromeric heterochromatin By separating cells according to transgene expression we show here that silencing appears to be associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), DNA methylation and the localization of the silenced gene to a specific nuclear compartment enriched in these modifications The cell nucleus is divided into chromosome territories and the extrachromosomal domain. The latter includes several structural and functional compartments involved in RNA processing and transport. We also describe a new apocentric nuclear compartment with a unique set of histone modifications that occurs as a zone of chromatin surrounding centromeric heterochromatin in differentiated lymphocytes.  Little is known about the mechanisms of gene targeting within the nucleus and its effect on gene expression, but most studies have concluded that genes located near the nuclear periphery are silenced by heterochromatin After TSA and NaBt treatment, the HP1 proteins were repositioned more internally in the nucleus, being closely associated with interchromatin compartments, while centromeric heterochromatin was relocated closer to the nuclear periphery Taking into account the different heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome, our data suggest that the relative abundance of Ty3/gypsy LTRrs along each chromosome arm is determined mainly by the different proportions of heterochromatin, particularly pericentric heterochromatin, relative to total arm length	[['peripheral heterochromatin'], ['perinucleolar heterochromatin'], ['pericentromeric heterochromatin']]
5300aad02059c6d71c000080	Which sports have a risk for commotio cordis?	This study sought to characterize the demographics of commotio cordis globally in comparison to the U.S. experience. Not unexpectedly, the groups differed with baseball/softball and football predominant in the United States (55% of events) and soccer, cricket, and hockey most common internationally (47% of events).  The authors reviewed 41 incidents of baseball injuries reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research from 1982 until 2002. Catastrophic injuries included 23 severe head injuries, 8 cervical injuries, 3 cases of commotio cordis, and 2 cases each of a collapsed trachea and facial fractures. Commotio cordis events occurred most commonly during organized sporting events (79 [62%]), such as baseball, but 49 (38%) occurred as part of daily routine and recreational activities. Twenty-two (28%) participants were wearing commercially available chest barriers, including 7 in whom the projectile made direct contact with protective padding (baseball catchers and lacrosse/hockey goalies), and 2 in whom the projectile was a baseball specifically designed to reduce risk. In a recent study of fatal chest impacts by baseballs, 28% of the children were wearing a chest protector. This study evaluates the effectiveness of chest protectors in reducing the risk of commotio cordis.  It has been described after blows to the chest from baseballs, softballs, hockey pucks, and other objects. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Several measures, such as the use of safety baseballs and the use of chest protectors, can help protect young athletes from commotio cordis.

5547a7e9f35db75526000006	Which enzymes are involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) in bacteria?	we evaluated the in vivo role of NER in the repair of DNA adducts generated by psoralens (mono- or bi-functional) and UV-A light (PUVA) in E. coli. Cultures of wild-type E. coli K12 and mutants for uvrA, uvrB, uvrC or uvrAC genes were treated with PUVA and cell survival was determined. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is universally used to recognize and remove many types of DNA damage. In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase. During nucleotide excision repair (NER) in bacteria the UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase. UvrD interacts with UvrB, a component of the post-incision complex. PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex, which supports the idea that PcrA performs a UvrD-like function during NER in gram-positive organisms. Cho rather than UvrC seems to be an effective nuclease for the NER of DPCs. Nucleotide excision repair consists of excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain. we used a genetic approach to investigate the roles of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway components in H. pylori mutation and recombination. RESULTS: Inactivation of any of the four uvr genes strongly increased the susceptibility of H. pylori to DNA damage by ultraviolet light. Inactivation of uvrA and uvrB significantly decreased mutation frequencies whereas only the uvrA deficient mutant exhibited a significant decrease of the recombination frequency after natural transformation. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold increase) into the recipient chromosome. A deletion of uvrD induced a hyper-recombinational phenotype. Transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that is triggered when RNA polymerase is stalled by DNA damage. Lesions targeted by TCR are repaired more quickly than lesions repaired by the transcription-independent "global" NER pathway, but the mechanism underlying this rate enhancement is not understood. Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Bacterial TCR additionally requires the Mfd protein, a DNA translocase that removes the stalled transcription complexes.

590c740d70f9fc6f0f00001d	Which proteins are controlling sterol metabolism in S. cerevisiae?	We have taken advantage of this property to study the regulation of the Delta8-Delta7-sterol isomerase-encoding ERG2 gene in an ergosterol auxotrophic mutant devoid of squalene-synthase activity.  Ergosterol starvation leads to an 8-16-fold increase in ERG2 gene expression. The yeast genome encodes seven oxysterol binding protein homologs, Osh1p-Osh7p, which have been implicated in regulating intracellular lipid and vesicular transport Sterol metabolism and ERG2 gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomewide location analysis of Candida albicans Upc2p, a regulator of sterol metabolism and azole drug resistance. To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important regulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans  Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to ergosterol biosynthesis genes. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1).  Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others) Cell wall maintenance genes TIR4 and CCW12, sterol metabolism gene UPC2, small molecule transport genes AUS1 and YHK8, and stress response gene CUP1-1 were expressed at a level at least 2.5-fold higher than the expression level found in 9763S.

56d2ac03f22319765a000004	Which ones are the ESKAPE organisms?	The aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes.  Multidrug resistance among the 'ESKAPE' organisms - encompassing Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. - is of particular concern because they are responsible for many serious infections in hospitals. Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species).

5c54224807647bbc4b000001	What are the roles of LEM-3?	LEM-3 is a midbody-tethered DNA nuclease that resolves chromatin bridges during late mitosis. Using C. elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide. LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer. The conserved LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease is involved in the combinatorial regulation of meiotic recombination repair and chromosome segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality. The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.

We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mRNA differential display (DD) analysis to obtain a profile of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in osteoblast-like cells At the 2-hour time point, 1 true-positive novel clone was identified and shown to be the mitochondrial gene, subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATPase-6). We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment. Following this procedure, we now report the identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as target of thyroid hormone. Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene.

Developmental delay was noted on follow-up which raised the possibility of intermediate DEND syndrome. We have verified a lack of clinical response for both glycemic control and neurological features in an infant with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and DEND syndrome due to a V59A mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.  They also may cause neurologic symptoms such as mental retardation and motor problems (iDEND syndrome) and epilepsy (DEND syndrome).   Wide phenotype variability is associated with single ABCC8 mutations, ranging from transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (ND) with or without developmental delay (DEND syndrome) to very mild phenotypes.  Specific uncommon mutations KCNJ11give rise to a syndrome defined as developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND), or - more frequently - to a milder sub-type lacking epilepsy, denoted as intermediate-DEND (iDEND). Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome.

553fa78b1d53b76422000007	Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?	Finally, five promising differentially miRNAs (miR-200a, miR-100, miR-141, miR-200b, and miR-200c) were reported with the consistent direction in four or more studies. MiR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-141, all of them belong to miR-200 family, were reported with consistently up-regulated in at least 4 studies, whereas miR-100 was reported with down-regulated in 4 studies Upregulation of microRNA-203 is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer multivariate analysis showed that the status of miR-203 expression was an independent predictor for both overall survival and progression-free survival in EOC. These findings provide the convincing evidence for the first time that the upregulation of miR-203 may serve as a novel molecular marker to predict the aggressive tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis of EOC patients Some, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissues There was a significantly positive correlation between miR-200a and E-cadherin in EOC. The biphasic expression pattern suggested that miR-200a levels may serve as novel biomarkers for the early detection of EOC, and miR-200a and E-cadherin are candidate targets for the development of new treatment modalities against ovarian cancer Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that miRNAs may play a role in the progression of OSC, and miR-510 and miR-509-5p may be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results In this study, we examined serum miR-21 levels in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, and explored its association with clinicopathological factors and prognosis. The results showed significantly higher serum miR-21 levels in EOC patients than in healthy controls. In addition, increased serum miR-21 expression was correlated with advanced FIGO stage, high tumor grade, and shortened overall survival. These findings indicate that serum miR-21 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker, and be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of EOC Identification of serum microRNA-21 as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in human epithelial ovarian cancer Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls.

5e36e254b5b409ea53000010	List SLC25A46-related pathologies	The mitochondrial protein SLC25A46 has been recently identified as a novel pathogenic cause in a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, including inherited optic atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, Leigh syndrome, progressive myoclonic ataxia and lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Here we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the Slc25a46 gene that causes lethal neuropathology in mice. Mutant mice manifest the main clinical features identified in patients, including ataxia, optic atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia, which were completely rescued by expression of the human ortholog. Histopathological analysis revealed previously unseen lesions, most notably disrupted cytoarchitecture in the cerebellum and retina and prominent abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction. A distinct lymphoid phenotype was also evident. Our mutant mice provide a valid model for understanding the mechanistic basis of the complex SLC25A46-mediated pathologies, as well as for screening potential therapeutic interventions.

550712739d0faaa527000008	Which mutations in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been found to be related to CPVT?	Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2. The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays. The S4153R mutation enhanced propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and reduced SOICR threshold but did not alter Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding, a common feature of other CPVT gain-of-function RYR2 mutations. We conclude that the S4153R mutation is a gain-of-function RYR2 mutation associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by both CPVT and atrial fibrillation. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction.  We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05). The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a "leaky" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.   Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals. RyR2 mutations suggested to cause defective Ca2+ channel function have recently been identified in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) affected individuals. We report expression of three CPVT-linked human RyR2 (hRyR2) mutations (S2246L, N4104K, and R4497C) in HL-1 cardiomyocytes displaying correct targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.

551adceb622b194345000018	Which factors are considered in the ABCD2 score?	The 'accuracy' of age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration and diabetes (ABCD(2)) scoring by non-stroke specialists referring patients to a daily Rapid Access Stroke Prevention (RASP) service is unclear, as is the accuracy of ABCD(2) scoring by trainee residents.   Classification of low risk was based on an age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score <4 and the absence of high risk features, including known carotid disease, crescendo TIA, or atrial fibrillation.  Our goal was to compare the very early predictive accuracy of the most relevant clinical scores [age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms (ABCD) score, ABCD and diabetes (ABCD2) score, ABCD and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD2 and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD and prior TIA within 1 week of the index event (ABCD3) score, California Risk Score, Essen Stroke Risk Score and Stroke Prognosis Instrument II] in consecutive transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients.  We examined the association of the age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score, a validated risk prediction model for stroke after TIA, and the presence of ICS or ECS.  BACKGROUND: The ABCD2 score (Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms and Diabetes) is used to identify patients having a transient ischemic attack who are at high risk for imminent stroke.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score).  BACKGROUND: Modifications to the age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and diabetes (ABCD2) score, which incorporate history of hypertension and acute hyperglycemia in addition to acute blood pressure (BP) elevation and history of diabetes, have been proposed to increase the predictive value of the score.  ABCD2 (Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration, Diabetes) score and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities help to identify patients at high risk of stroke. METHODS: We prospectively calculated the ABCD(2) score (age [> or = 60 years: 1 point]; blood pressure [systolic >140 mm Hg or diastolic >90 mm Hg: 1[; clinical features [unilateral weakness: 2, speech disturbance without weakness: 1, other symptom: 0]; duration of symptoms [ <10 minutes: 0, 10-59 minutes: 1, > or = 60 minutes: 2]; diabetes mellitus [yes: 1]) in consecutive TIA patients hospitalized in 3 tertiary care neurology departments across 2 different racial populations (white and Asian).  Early stroke risk is especially high in TIA patients with a high ABCD2 score of 4 or more (A age over 60 years [1 point]: B blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg [1 point]: C Clinical features, including unilateral weakness [2 points] and speech disturbance without weakness [1 point] D2: Diabetes [1 point] and Duration of symptoms [1 point for < 60 min and 2 points for > 60 min]), acute ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted image, > 50% carotid stenosis, severe intracranial artery stenosis, microembolic signals on transcranial Doppler, atrial fibrillation, or hypercoagulable states. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate, in admitted patients with transient ischemic attack, the accuracy of the ABCD(2) (age [A], blood pressure [B], clinical features [weakness/speech disturbance] [C], transient ischemic attack duration [D], and diabetes history [D]) score in predicting ischemic stroke within 7 days.  Our goal was to compare the very early predictive accuracy of the most relevant clinical scores [age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms (ABCD) score, ABCD and diabetes (ABCD2) score, ABCD and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD2 and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD and prior TIA within 1 week of the index event (ABCD3) score, California Risk Score, Essen Stroke Risk Score and Stroke Prognosis Instrument II] in consecutive transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score).

Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of 34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209. SweeD: likelihood-based detection of selective sweeps in thousands of genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used SweepFinder program The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core processors. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. RAiSD detects positive selection based on multiple signatures of a selective sweep and SNP vectors. We present RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection), an open-source software that implements a novel, to our knowledge, and parameter-free detection mechanism that relies on multiple signatures of a selective sweep via the enumeration of SNP vectors.

531d7430267d7dd053000008	Which are the drugs utilized for the burning mouth syndrome?	On average, treatment with placebos produced a response that was 72% as large as the response to active drugs. The concomitant prescription of tongue protector and AV is effective for treating patients with BMS. We suggest that a subset of patients with BMS may be a phenotypic variant of RLS and a trial of dopaminergic drugs should be given in patients with BMS who has a history suggestive of RLS or in a patient who do not show a response to usual therapies for BMS. The systemic administration of Catuama reduces the symptoms of BMS and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. Topical clonazepam, which previous analyses of clinical evidence have shown to be the drug of choice for BMS, also proved to be the most cost-effective of the drugs analysed for this condition.

52eeddfcc8da898910000010	Which are the characteristics of  Andersen syndrome?	Mutations of KCNJ2, the gene encoding the human inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1, cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a disease exhibiting ventricular arrhythmia, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic features. Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis or Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes the distinct clinical features of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and facial and skeletal dysmorphisms and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance.  The patient was a 19-year-old woman with familial periodic paralysis, abnormal QT-U complex, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare inherited disorder, characterised by periodic paralysis, cardiac dysarrhythmias, and dysmorphic features, and is caused by mutations in the gene KCNJ2, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1. Evaluation of candidate loci culminated in the identification of a heterozygous missense mutation (R67W) in KCNJ2, the gene encoding the inward-rectifying potassium current, Kir2.1, in 41 members of a kindred in which ventricular arrhythmias (13 of 16 female members [81%]) and periodic paralysis (10 of 25 male members [40%]) segregated as autosomal dominant traits with sex-specific variable expressivity. Some mutation carriers exhibited dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, small mandible, syndactyly, clinodactyly, cleft palate, and scoliosis, which, together with cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis, have been termed "Andersen syndrome."

53358cd2d6d3ac6a3400004e	List two common features of Tay syndrome.	TTD is part of a more broadly defined group of diseases identified as IBIDS (ichthyosis, brittle hair, impaired intelligence, decreased fertility and short stature). Photosensitive cases are also identified as PIBIDS (photosensitivity with IBIDS). Cases without manifest ichthyosis are also identified as PBIDS. These syndromes defy rigorous definition because of clinical variation between patients. The original two cases were described by Tay in oriental siblings, whose parents were first cousins; thus the disease is also known as Tay syndrome.  Tay syndrome or IBIDS is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis and abnormal brittle hair (trichothiodystrophy). Other features include photosensitivity, abnormal nails and multiple developmental defects affecting organs mainly derived from neuroectoderm.  We report a case of trichothiodystrophy initially classified as Tay syndrome that based on clinical features, complementary exams as well as on the disease evolution was labelled as PIBIDS syndrome. Tay-syndrome is a rare monogen-inherited ektodermal dysplastic syndrome with ichtyosis, fragility of the hair and physical and mental retardation. The congenital ichtyosis is ubiquitous. Only the skin on the flexion side of the extremity joints are not involved (orthocerathosis combined with paraceratotic strings). In Tay syndrome, the trichothiodystrophy is accompanied by congenital ichthyosis, short stature, delayed physical and mental development and pyramidal tract signs with increase in muscular tone and brisk tendon reflexes.  We present a case of Tay syndrome in which a cranial MRI revealed an almost total lack of myelin within the cerebral hemispheres and a patchy hypomyelination of the cerebellum. In accordance, a strongly prolonged visual evoked response pointed to a dysfunction of the white matter in Tay syndrome. For example, the brittle hair due to sulphur deficiency (trichothiodystrophy) is nowadays regarded as genetically heterogeneous; three different syndromes can be distinguished: BIDS syndrome, Tay syndrome, and PIBIDS syndrome.  The Tay syndrome (congenital ichthyosis with trichothiodystrophy). The Tay syndrome is a distinct type of congenital ichthyosis characterized by a peculiar anomaly of hair growth which has been termed trichothiodystrophy.  Other features of this syndrome are low birth weight, short stature, mental retardation, delayed neuromuscular development and other CNS anomalies, dysplasia of nails, hypoplasia of subcutaneous fatty tissue, prematurely aged facial appearance, hypogonadism, cataracts, osteosclerosis, dysphonia, and increased susceptibility to infections.

DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics.  in this paper, we use recent state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods and develop a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture, called EP-DNN, to predict the presence and types of enhancers in the human genome.

5a6f7e6ab750ff4455000052	List four principles of medical ethics.	Respect for Autonomy (RFA) has been a mainstay of medical ethics since its enshrinement as one of the four principles of biomedical ethics by Beauchamp and Childress' in the late 1970s There are four principles of medical ethics; Beneficence, Respect for autonomy, Non-maleficence, and Justice. This paper argues that the four prima facie principles-beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice-afford a good and widely acceptable basis for 'doing good medical ethics'.  Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice. Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm. Guided by the medical ethics principles of "four principles plus scope," Chinese aesthetic medical practitioners have proposed some extremely valuable ethical principles combined with the construction of aesthetic medicine and the requirements of clinical practice such as the principle of general nonmaleficence, the principle of local minimal invasiveness, the principle of informed consent, and the principle of respect and confidentiality. This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles. BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care.  Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted.  Tom Beauchamp and James Childress have always maintained that their four principles approach (otherwise known as principlism) is a globally applicable framework for biomedical ethics. This claim is grounded in their belief that the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice form part of a 'common morality', or collection of very general norms to which everyone who is committed to morality subscribes. I will argue that there are difficulties with the application of the four principles approach to incompetent children. The most important principle - respect for autonomy - is not directly applicable to incompetent children and the most appropriate modification of the principle for them is not clear. The principle of beneficence - that one should act in the child's interests - is complicated by difficulties in assessing what a child's interests are and to which standard of interests those choosing for children should be held. These principles are: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, along with concern for their scope of application. BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. Four main principles underlie medical ethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.

The respective phenotypic presentation seems to be determined by the exact PRPS1 mutation and the residual enzyme activity, the latter being largely influenced by the degree of skewed X-inactivation Mutations in PRPS1 are associated with a spectrum of non-syndromic to syndromic hearing loss Gain of function mutations in PRPS1 cause a superactivity of the PRS-I protein whereas the loss-of-function mutations result in X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness type 2 (DFN2), or in syndromic deafness including Arts syndrome and X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5) X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Arts syndrome, and prelingual non-syndromic deafness form a disease continuum: evidence from a family with a novel PRPS1 mutation.

Results indicate that (1) similar to those previously reported for GnRH stimulation by the KISS1R agonist (i.e., human kisspeptin-10), the NK3R agonist senktide stimulated GnRH release in a dose-responsive manner in both prepubertal and pubertal monkeys; (2) the senktide-induced GnRH release was blocked in the presence of the KISS1R antagonist peptide 234 in pubertal but not prepubertal monkeys; and (3) the kisspeptin-induced GnRH release was blocked in the presence of the NK3R antagonist SB222200 in the pubertal but not prepubertal monkeys. NK3R antagonist AZD4901 40 mg twice daily orally was taken from cycle day 4-6 for 6 days (n = 10, with 10 no treatment controls).

Clinically approved inhibitors were selected as well as several other reported metalloprotein inhibitors in order to represent a broad range of metal binding groups (MBGs), including hydroxamic acid, carboxylate, hydroxypyridinonate, thiol, and N-hydroxyurea functional groups. A total of 21 different raltegravir-chelator derivative (RCD) compounds were prepared that differed only in the nature of the MBG.  At least two compounds (RCD-4, RCD-5) containing a hydroxypyrone MBG were found to display superior strand-transfer inhibition when compared to an abbreviated analogue of raltegravir (RCD-1).  By screening a library of metalloenzyme inhibitors, the N-formyl-hydroxylamine derivative BB-3497 was identified as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli peptide deformylase with antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo.

54f431d664850a5854000006	Which are the genes responsible for Dyskeratosis Congenita?	Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2) Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome with seven disease-causing genes identified to date, six of which are linked to telomere maintenance. Mutations in one of these genes (TINF2), which encodes a component of the shelterin complex, are associated with particularly short telomeres Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inheritable bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation, dystrophic nails and oral leukoplakia Four genes, namely DKC1 (codes for dyskerin), TERC and TERT (code for telomerase) and NOP10, have been implicated in the pathogenesis To date, CTC1, DKC1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, NHP2, NOP10, and WRAP53 are the genes in which mutations are known to cause DC and result in very short telomeres The mode of inheritance of DC varies by gene: DKC1 (X-linked), TERC and TINF2 (autosomal dominant), TERT (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive), CTC1, WRAP53, NHP2, and NOP10 (autosomal recessive) Six genes have been identified, defects in which cause different genetic subtypes (X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive) of DC. The products of these genes encode components that are critical for telomere maintenance; either because they are core constituents of telomerase (dyskerin, TERC, TERT, NOP10 and NHP2) or are part of the shelterin complex that protects the telomeric end (TIN2) BACKGROUND: Telomerase complex genes mutations (DKC1, TERC, TERT, and NOP10) lead to premature telomere shortening and are responsible for different forms of dyskeratosis congenita.

A common over-the-counter (OTC) non-opioid antitussive drug, clobutinol, was recently withdrawn from the market due to its potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias by a blockade of the potassium channel coded by the human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (hERG). n. However, despite this, at the time of writing orlistat (Europe; USA) remains the only drug currently marketed for the treatment of obesity, with sibutramine having recently been withdrawn from sale globally due to the increased incidence of serious, non-fatal cardiovascular events Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity. Sibutramine was associated with an increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial and it was withdrawn from the market in 2010 The safety of the most popular agent, aprotinin, has been challenged, and it was withdrawn from world markets in May 2008 because of concerns that it increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and death.To assess the comparative effects of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) on blood loss during surgery, the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and adverse events, particularly vascular occlusion, renal dysfunction, and death.We searched: the Cochrane Injuries Groups Specialised Register (July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to July 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to July 2010.

Rofecoxib and valdecoxib have been withdrawn from the market worldwide due to safety concerns (most importantly for cardiovascular adverse events) and lumiracoxib has been withdrawn in many countries due to liver toxicity In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity.  Rofecoxib and valdecoxib have been withdrawn from the market worldwide due to safety concerns (most importantly for cardiovascular adverse events) and lumiracoxib has been withdrawn in many countries due to liver toxicity. Sertindole , first withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular safety concerns, is currently available in many countries. In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market. The lesson learnt from this is the importance of patient selection, limiting the duration of treatment and stopping treatment in non-responders. Currently, phentermine and amfepramone (diethylpropion) are approved for short-term treatment of obesity (up to 3 months) and orlistat is approved for longer-term treatment; however, the gastrointestinal adverse effects of orlistat may be intolerable for some patients. BACKGROUND: Certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., rofecoxib [Vioxx]) increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and should be avoided in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market. Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity.  Rofecoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, was a widely marketed drug that was used for relief of pain and inflammation in arthritic conditions.

58adb9919ef3c34033000004	Which proteins form part of the NRD complex in S. cerevisiae?	This activity is derived from the CHD3 and CHD4 proteins which contain helicase/ATPase domains found in SWI2-related chromatin remodelling factors, and facilitates the deacetylation of oligonucleosomal histones in vitro. We refer to this complex as the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylating (NRD) complex Molecular association between ATR and two components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating complex, HDAC2 and CHD4 The purification of an ATR complex allowed identification of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an ATR-associated protein by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. CHD4 (also called Mi-2beta) is a component of a histone-deacetylase-2 (HDAC2)-containing complex, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NRD) complex Endogenous ATR, CHD4, and HDAC2 are shown to coimmunoprecipitate, and ATR and HDAC2 coelute through two biochemical purification steps. Other members of the NRD complex, HDAC1, MTA1, and MTA2, are also detectable in ATR immunoprecipitates. Sen1 of S. cerevisiae is a known component of the NRD complex implicated in transcription termination of nonpolyadenylated as well as some polyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts.  We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID).

51630226298dcd4e5100004d	What are the advantages of the top down mass spectrometric analysis of histones?	recent advances in MS technology, such as high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)-mass spectrometry, have permitted the study of intact proteins and their modifications. On-line and off-line protein separation instruments coupled to FTICR-MS allow the characterization of PTMs previously undetectable with bottom-up approaches. With just â¼24âÎ¼g on-column of core histones (H4, H2B, H2A, and H3) purified from human fibroblasts, 41 H4 isoforms were identified, with the type and location of PTMs unambiguously mapped for 20 of these variants. Our results indicated that dH1 is extensively modified by phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination, with most PTMs falling in the N-terminal domain Optimized for the intricacies of whole proteins, new software modules visualize proteome-scale data based on the LC retention time and intensity of intact masses and enable selective detection of PTMs to automatically screen for acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. our UHPLC-MS approach for histone profiling offers a sensitive and reproducible tool that will be of great value for exploring PTMs and variants This work demonstrates the power of top-down MS for a detailed structural confirmation of recombinant proteins, even without prior information on aa substitutions or modifications. Top and Middle Down MS were utilized to identify the most commonly occurring combinatorially modified forms. In this paper we investigate the application of spectral alignment to the problem of identifying protein forms in top-down mass spectra (i.e., identifying the modifications, mutations, insertions, and deletions). This work represents the most comprehensive analysis of histone H4 forms present in human cells reported to date. Metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H4 is progressively methylated at K20 during the G(2), M, and G(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible. The "top down" mass spectrometry approach detected dramatic decreases in acetylation on H3 and H2B in gcn5Delta cells versus wild type. In sum, we have defined the "basis set" of histone forms present in yeast chromatin using a current mass spectrometric approach that both quickly profiles global changes and directly probes the connectivity of modifications on the same histone. Recent developments in top down mass spectrometry have enabled closely related histone variants and their modified forms to be identified and quantitated with unprecedented precision, facilitating efforts to better understand how histones contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and other nuclear processes. This unequivocal identification of H2A forms illustrates the advantages of Top Down Mass Spectrometry and provides a global perspective of H2A regulation through the cell cycle. The modification of H3 in asynchronous HeLa cells was profiled using Top Down Mass Spectrometry. The basis set of protein forms expressed by human cells from the H2B gene family was determined by Top Down Mass Spectrometry. To help crack this code more efficiently, we demonstrate a new strategy for protein characterization wherein complete PTM descriptions are obtained by database retrieval instead of manual interpretation of information-rich data from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Targeted analysis and discovery of posttranslational modifications in proteins from methanogenic archaea by top-down MS.

5516757c46478f2f2c000008	Which are the main NMD factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?	In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) requires Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p to accelerate the decay rate of two unique classes of transcripts: (1) nonsense mRNAs that arise through errors in gene expression, and (2) naturally occurring transcripts that lack coding errors but have built-in features that target them for accelerated decay (error-free mRNAs) In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p Our results indicate that Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p regulate decapping and exonucleolytic degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs. In addition, we show that these factors also regulate the same processes in the degradation of wild-type mRNAs This quality control pathway depends on the NMD-specific factors, Upf1p, Upf2p/Nmd2p, and Upf3p, as well as the two release factors, eRF1 and eRF3 (respectively designated Sup45p and Sup35p in yeast) In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation.  Association of yeast Upf1p with direct substrates of the NMD pathway  Translation termination factors eRF1 (Sup45) and eRF3 (Sup35) participate not only in the last step of protein synthesis but also in mRNA degradation and translation initiation via interaction with such proteins as Pab1, Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3. From these results, we conclude that sup111, sup112 and sup113 are mutant alleles of UPF2, UPF3 and UPF1, respectively, and thus attribute suppressor activity of these mutations to defects in the NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) machinery. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) requires Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p to accelerate the decay rate of two unique classes of transcripts: (1) nonsense mRNAs that arise through errors in gene expression, and (2) naturally occurring transcripts that lack coding errors but have built-in features that target them for accelerated decay (error-free mRNAs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p. To date, human (h) Upf1 protein (p) (hUpf1p), a group 1 RNA helicase named after its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue that functions in both translation termination and NMD, has been the only factor shown to be required for NMD in mammalian cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5-to-3 exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three trans-acting factors (Upf1p to Upf3p) are required for NMD. Interactions between Upf1 and the decapping factors Edc3 and Pat1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of this pathway depends on the recognition of the PTC by the translational machinery and interaction of translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 with Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3 proteins. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of this pathway depends on the recognition of the PTC by the translational machinery and interaction of translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 with Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3 proteins NMD activation is also enabled by the absence of the poly(A)-binding protein, Pab1p, downstream of a termination event Of those, a group of weak and recessive suppressors, sup111, sup112 and sup113, is of particular interest because of their dependency on [PSI+], a yeast prion.

5ace34eb0340b9f058000010	Which genes are associated with Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex?	In one family studied, inheritance of EBS is linked to the gene encoding keratin 14 In the first family, linkage was found to chromosome 17 markers flanking the keratin 14 gene (D17S74: Zmax = +2.45, theta = 0.10; COL1A1: Zmax = +0.97, theta = 0.00) and markers near the keratin 5 gene on chromosome 12 were excluded (D12S17: Z less than -2.0, theta = 0.08; COL2A1: Z less than -2.0, theta = 0.13). In contrast, the second family showed linkage to the region containing the keratin 5 gene (D12S17: Zmax = +1.37, theta = 0.08; COL2A1: Zmax = +0.33, theta = 0.15) and was not linked to the keratin 14 gene (D17S74: Z less than -2.0, theta = 0.14).  Keratin 14 gene mutations in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex. We have systematically scanned genomic sequences of one of these keratins, keratin 14, for mutations in patients from 49 apparently independent kindreds using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.  Keratin 14 gene point mutation in the KÃ¶bner and Dowling-Meara types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex as detected by the PASA method. Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled the association of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) with point mutations of keratin 14 and/or keratin 5 genes to be established.  Homozygous deletion mutations in the plectin gene (PLEC1) in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex associated with late-onset muscular dystrophy.  In this study, we report two patients with EB-MD, each with a homozygous deletion mutation in the plectin gene, PLEC1. A homozygous nonsense mutation in the PLEC1 gene in patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy. A compound heterozygous one amino-acid insertion/nonsense mutation in the plectin gene causes epidermolysis bullosa simplex with plectin deficiency. The KRT5 and KRT14 genes encode the proteins keratin 5 and 14, respectively, which are the primary structural components of the 10-nm intermediate filaments of the mitotic epidermal basal cells. Keratin 5 and keratin 14 are known to be essential for the basal keratinocyte cytoskeleton and are defective in several forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Severe palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis in Dowling-Meara epidermolysis bullosa simplex caused by a mutation in the keratin 14 gene (KRT14). Mutant keratins 5 or 14 are implicated in the etiology of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS).  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is mainly caused by mutations in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes. Verrucous carcinoma in epidermolysis bullosa simplex is possibly associated with a novel mutation in the keratin 5 gene. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a rare genodermatosis resulting from multiple gene mutations, including KRT5 and KRT14. Study of a family with epidermolysis bullosa simplex resulting from a novel mutation of KRT14 gene This is the first report of EBS-generalized intermediate in a newborn with de novo KRT5 gene mutation and KRT14 gene polymorphism, and no familial history of epidermolysis.  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is an inherited skin disorder caused by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) and keratin 14 (KRT14) genes, with fragility of basal keratinocytes leading to epidermal cytolysis and blistering.In this study, we characterized mutations in KRT5 and KRT14 genes in patients with EBS and investigated their possible structure-function correlations.Mutations were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a mechanobullous genodermatosis that may be caused by mutations in the genes KRT5 and KRT14 encoding the basal epidermal keratins 5 (K5) and 14 (K14). Basal epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a hereditary skin blistering disorder resulting in most cases from missense mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) or keratin 14 (KRT14) genes. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is a hereditary skin blistering disorder caused by mutations in the KRT5 or KRT14 genes. BACKGROUND Basal epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a hereditary skin blistering disorder resulting in most cases from missense mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) or keratin 14 (KRT14) genes. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is a group of blistering skin disorders caused by defects in one of the keratin genes, KRT5 and KRT14. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an autosomal dominant inherited skin blistering disorder caused by mutations in the genes KRT5 or KRT14 coding for the basal epidermal keratins 5 and 14, respectively.

5e80caeb835f4e477700002b	What is the drug chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine used for?	Chloroquine (CQ) has been used for decades as the primary chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of malaria.  Historically chloroquine was used to treat the most deadly form of malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.  we investigated how chloroquine (CQ), a commonly employed disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial, is regarded as the oral therapy of choice for cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is also licensed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.

5884fe4ce56acf5176000010	SPAG5 was implicated in which cancers?	BACKGROUND: We conducted multiple microarray datasets analyses from clinical and xenograft tumor tissues to search for disease progression-driving oncogenes in prostate cancer (PCa). Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) attracted our attention. SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression. CONCLUSION: Our results collectively showed a progression-driving role of SPAG5 in PCa which can be regulated by miR-539, suggesting that miR-539/SPAG5 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa. RESULTS: We identified that SPAG5 expression was gradually increased in PCa progression and its level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence. Our results indicated that SPAG5 knockdown can drastically inhibit PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and supress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.  miR-539 inhibits prostate cancer progression by directly targeting SPAG5. SPAG5 as a prognostic biomarker and chemotherapy sensitivity predictor in breast cancer: a retrospective, integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and protein analysis. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR]1Â·50, 95% CI 1Â·18-1Â·92, p=0Â·00010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1Â·68, 1Â·40-2Â·01, p<0Â·0001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1Â·68, 1Â·32-2Â·12, p<0Â·0001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1Â·62, 95% CI 1Â·03-2Â·53, p=0Â·036; METABRIC: 1Â·27, 1Â·02-1Â·58, p=0Â·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2Â·34, 1Â·24-4Â·42, p=0Â·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1Â·73, 1Â·23-2Â·46, p=0Â·0020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0Â·37, 95% CI 0Â·20-0Â·60, p=0Â·0010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0Â·68, 95% CI 0Â·48-0Â·97, p=0Â·031).  INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. SPAG5 upregulation predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients and alters sensitivity to taxol treatment via the mTOR signaling pathway. Previously, we found that sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) was upregulated in pelvic lymph node metastasis-positive cervical cancer. In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in cervical cancer. RESULTS: We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC, including SPAG5, POLH, KIF23, and RAD54L, which are associated with mitotic spindle formation, DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and dsDNA break repair, respectively. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. In our study, SPAG5 expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays.  In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0Â·37, 95% CI 0Â·20-0Â·60, p=0Â·0010). We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), N In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1Â·62, 95% CI 1Â·03-2Â·53, p=0Â·036; METABRIC: 1Â·27, 1Â·02-1Â·58, p=0Â·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2Â·34, 1Â·24-4Â·42, p=0Â·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1Â·73, 1Â·23-2Â·46, p=0Â·0020). THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. Furthermore, men with THY1 positive breast cancers had significantly inferior survival. THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation.

However, the involvement of two related inflammatory caspase members, caspases-4 and -5, during intestinal homeostasis and disease has not yet been established. This study demonstrates that caspases-4 and -5 are involved in IBD-associated intestinal inflammation. Altered activity of caspases, particularly caspase-1, has been implicated in the development of intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) In contrast, engagement of various PRR in the recently identified inflammasome complexes lead to activation of a cysteine protease, caspase-1.  ctivation of inflammatory caspase proteases.

54fb5c69d176fff445000003	Which are the 3 basic transcription factors that have been used for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte like-cells?	Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT). Here we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for in vitro cardiac reprogramming using retroviruses encoding GMT. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C.  Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors. Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.  We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, in vitro and in vivo. To assess the efficiency of direct fibroblast reprogramming via viral overexpression of GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT).   In addition, transplantation of GMT infected CFs into injured mouse hearts resulted in decreased cell survival with minimal induction of cardiomyocyte genes. Here, to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes. Through this screening method the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4 that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously. More recently, we showed that reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo after coronary artery ligation using three cardiac transcription factors (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) offers an alternative approach to regenerate heart muscle. Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Srivastava's group reported the first direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblast cells into mesoderm lineage cells (cardiomyocytes) with the enforced expression of three cardiac transcriptional factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.

531b1e3cb166e2b80600003b	Which histone modifications are associated with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins?	The PcG proteins are well-conserved chromatin factors that repress transcription of numerous target genes. They bind the genome at specific sites, forming chromatin domains of associated histone modifications as well as higher-order chromatin structures. A component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates the addition of K27me3 to histone H3 (Suz12), was also recruited by 14 dpi We found that a component of the PRC1 complex (Bmi1), which binds to H3K27me3, was not enriched at promoters found previously to be enriched for H3K27me3  Here we show that the HSV DNA first associates with histone H3, with later recruitment of Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylation of the lysine 27 residue of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a modification associated with heterochromatin Here we show that direct recognition of methylated histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36me), a mark associated with activation, by the PRC2 subunit Phf19 is required for the full enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex Furthermore, we show that Phf19 binds to a subset of PRC2 targets in mouse embryonic stem cells and that this is required for their repression and for H3K27me3 deposition The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation (me3) of histone H3 lysine 27 (K27), and it is believed that this activity mediates transcriptional repression We show that loss of PRC2 activity results in a global increase in H3K27 acetylation Moreover, we provide evidence that the acetylation of H3K27 is catalyzed by the acetyltransferases p300 and CBP. Taken together, these studies suggest that patterns of epigenetic modifiers and the histone code influence the propensity of a gene to become hypermethylated in cancer and that DNMT3B plays an important role in regulating PRC1 function During differentiation, binding of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (K27me3), is lost on developmental genes that are transcriptionally induced chromodomain (CD) of the Drosophila Polycomb protein exhibits preferential binding affinity for histone H3 when trimethylated at lysine 27 Not all CDs bind preferentially to K27me3; rather, some display affinity towards both histone H3 trimethylated at K9 and H3K27me3, and one CD prefers K9me3	[['H3K27me3'], ['H3K27Ac'], ['H3K9me3'], ['H3K36me']]
58c6665602b8c60953000024	Which are the symptoms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency) is the most common red blood cell (RBC) enzyme disorder. The decrease as well as the absence of the enzyme increase RBC vulnerability to oxidative stress caused by exposure to certain medications or intake of fava beans. Among the most common clinical manifestations of this condition, acute hemolysis, chronic hemolysis, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and an asymptomatic form are observed. Red blood cells carry oxygen in the body and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase protects these cells from oxidative chemicals. If there is a lack of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, red blood cells can go acute hemolysis. Convulsion is a rare presentation for acute hemolysis due to Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency.  By far the most common form worldwide is the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency. In the most frequent variants of this disease hemolysis occurs only during stress, imposed for example by infection, "oxidative" drugs or after ingestion of fava beans. The most serious clinical complication of the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency is the rarely observed neonatal icterus. Some enzyme variants can cause chronic hemolysis which is described as chronic nonsperocytic hemolytic anemia.  One limitation of primaquine is that, at certain doses, primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PDd) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common human enzymopathy that affects cellular redox status and may lower flux into nonoxidative pathways of glucose metabolism The 6PGD deficiency was associated with a variable reticulocyte count and recurrent increased unconjugated bilirubinemia without anemia in the propositus, while no clinical or hematological symptoms were evident in her mother. The authors of this article make 5 particular recommendations: (1) Anyone suspected of G6PD deficiency should be screened; (2) exposure to oxidative stressors in these individuals should be avoided; (3) these patients should be informed of risks along with signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic crisis; (4) the clinician should be able to identify both laboratory and clinical signs of hemolysis; and finally, (5) if an acute hemolytic crisis is identified, the patient should be admitted for close observation and care. None of the patients with or without G6PD deficiency showed symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings indicating hemolysis before administration of the drug and 4 days thereafter. Kinetic and electrophoretic properties of 230--300 fold purified preparations of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from red cells of donors and patients with acute drug hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency were studied. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder in which haemolytic anaemia is the major symptom. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, its use is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (risk for haemolytic anaemia). The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the development of stroke in children with SCA is controversial. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive hemolytic anemia caused by a mutation in the G6PD gene on Xq28.

589c215778275d0c4a00003c	Which enzymes synthesize catecholamines in adrenal glands?	We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls. This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-Ã-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.  In the adrenal medulla, despite the absence of morphological changes, immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine Î²-hydroxylase and phenyl-ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase demonstrated an increased immunopositivity for these cathecolamine-synthesizing enzymes after intense exercise.  Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals. However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group. There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57.3%, P<0.004) in adrenal glands of obese mice. Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47.0%, P<0.005). Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected.  Differential housing (single vs. group) and social defeat of rats is known to alter the activity of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the medulla. The present studies examined the effect of 70 days of triad (3 rats per large cage) and individual housing of male rats on adrenal mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and on TH protein levels. As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands.  We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas.

54ff30dc6ad7dcbc1200000f	List human diseases involving genomic imprinting.	 Here we describe the clinical case of a female patient with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a genomic imprinting disorder Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases, including the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, associated with aberrant foetal growth. Perturbed imprinted gene expression is also implicated in the neuro-developmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. This epigenetic "life cycle" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome and Hydatidiform mole. In the neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed. eregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases as gestation trophoblastic disease, Prader-Willi, Angelmann and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes and plays significant role in the carcinogenesis. Angelman's syndrome families, which are known to be imprinted.  Deregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes and cancer. Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon whereby some genes preferentially produce mRNA transcripts from the gene copy derived from the parent of a specific sex. It has been implicated in a number of human diseases (most of them of endocrine interest), such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, transient neonatal diabetes, the focal form of nesidioblastosis, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. imprinting disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci.  Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], malignancy [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): Nat Genet 4:110-113], and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [Julier et al.

517a8bab8ed59a060a000040	Which deiodinases are best known to be present in brain?	In brain, the presence of type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) seems to be important to maintain homeostasis of T(3) levels. We were able to detect a protein fragment corresponding to the expected molecular mass (30 kDa) for type III deiodinase by means of Western blot analysis. RT-PCR as well as Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of D3 mRNA in the cerebellum. The presence of 5D (type-III) together with our previous report of 5'-deiodinase (type-I in euthyroidism and type-II in hypothyroidism) shows that the isozymes of deiodinases in the neurohypophysis are quite similar to those in the brain.

5717ab7ccb4ef8864c00000c	Which are the main functions of G3BP1 and G3BP2 proteins?	Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 are required for translation of interferon stimulated mRNAs and are targeted by a dengue virus non-coding RNA We examined three conserved host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 in dengue virus (DENV-2) infection and found them to be novel regulators of the interferon (IFN) response against DENV-2 Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number like G3BP1, the overexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli Collectively, these results suggest that both G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a role in the formation of SGs in various human cells and thereby recovery from these cellular stresses Regulation of PMP22 mRNA by G3BP1 affects cell proliferation in breast cancer cells G3BP has been reported to both stabilize and induce degradation of specific mRNAs Global gene expression analyses of G3BP1- and G3BP2-depleted cells indicate that primarily G3BP1, and much less G3BP2, influences mRNA expression levels. Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) was one gene that was significantly influenced by G3BP1 depletion which led to a 2-3 fold increased expression Depletion of PMP22 resulted in increased proliferation and the G3BP1-mediated effect on proliferation was not seen upon PMP22-depletion Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are overexpressed in various human tumors and participate in several signaling pathways involved in growth, differentiation and apoptosis Two related proteins found in association with nsP4 at both times of infection, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and G3BP2 were also previously identified as associated with SINV nsP2 and nsP3. We demonstrate a likely overlapping role for these host factors in limiting SINV replication events Modulation of p53 and MDM2 activity by novel interaction with Ras-GAP binding proteins (G3BP) we have found that members of the Ras network of proteins, Ras-GTPase activating protein-SH3-domain-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and 2), bind to p53 in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that expression of G3BPs leads to the redistribution of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The G3BP2 isoform additionally associated with murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53. G3BP2 expression resulted in significant reduction in MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and degradation. Interestingly, MDM2 was also stabilized in G3BP2-expressing cells and its ability to ubiquitylate itself was compromised We identified several proteins, including DDX6, G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1, and USP10, implicated in P body (PB) and stress granule (SG) function, and not previously known to bind DENV RNAs. Additional experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to DDX6, the SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1 and USP10 bind to the variable region (VR) in the 3' UTR. G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 are required for translation of interferon stimulated mRNAs and are targeted by a dengue virus non-coding RNA. Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number.  Collectively, these results suggest that both G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a role in the formation of SGs in various human cells and thereby recovery from these cellular stresses. Furthermore, expression of shRNA targeting either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in human cancer cell lines resulted in marked upregulation of p53 levels and activity.  Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number. Moreover, like G3BP1, the overexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli. We found that HDAC6 interacts with another SG protein, G3BP (Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1), and localizes to SGs under all stress conditions tested. Dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly re-emerging flavivirus that causes dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), diseases for which there are no available therapies or vaccines.Â  The DENV-2 positive-strand RNA genome contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that have been shown to form secondary structures required for virus replication and interaction with host cell proteins.Â  In order to comprehensively identify host cell factors that bind the DENV-2 UTRs, we performed RNA chromatography, using the DENV-2 5' and 3' UTRs as "bait", combined with quantitative mass spectrometry.Â  We identified several proteins, including DDX6, G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1, and USP10, implicated in P body (PB) and stress granule (SG) function, and not previously known to bind DENV RNAs.

52e0141498d023950500000e	What are the results of loss of the protein Lon1 in the plant Arabidopsis?	Knockout in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leads to a significant growth rate deficit in both roots and shoots and lowered activity of specific mitochondrial enzymes associated with respiratory metabolism.  loss of Lon1 significantly modifies respiratory function and plant performance by small but broad alterations in the mitochondrial proteome gained by subtly changing steady-state protein assembly, stability, and damage of a range of components that debilitate an anaplerotic role for mitochondria in cellular carbon metabolism. the lack of Lon selective proteolysis leading to growth retardation and impaired seedling establishment can be attributed to defects in the oil reserve mobilization pathway.  Loss of Lon1 in Arabidopsis changes the mitochondrial proteome leading to altered metabolite profiles and growth retardation without an accumulation of oxidative damage.  a genetic screen was performed that led to the identification of Arabidopsis thaliana Lon1 protease mutants that exhibit a post-embryonic growth retardation phenotype. mitochondria isolated from lon1 mutants had a lower capacity for respiration of succinate and cytochrome c via complexes II and IV, respectively. Furthermore, the activity of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was significantly reduced. Additionally, mitochondria in lon1 mutants had an aberrant morphology.

58add7699ef3c34033000009	Which proteins does the yeast Cleavage and Polyadenylation Complex contain?	Gene loops have been described in different organisms from yeast to human and form through interaction between components of the transcription pre-initiation complex and Ssu72, a member of the 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation complex A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major poly(A) polymerase Pap1 produces mRNA 3' ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated snoRNAs in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome. Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6 A more important role of Trf4/TRAMP, however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with snoRNA genes. Screening crude natural product extracts with this technology has resulted in the identification of a novel family of antifungal natural products, named the parnafungins, which inhibit the enzyme polyadenosine polymerase (PAP), a key component of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex. We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3' cleavage and polyadenylation comple We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts. Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity.

54d4e03a3706e89528000001	Which are the classes of anti-arrhythmic drugs according to Vaughan-Williams classification?	Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.  Other agents which do not fall neatly into the Vaughan Williams classification include digoxin and perhexiline. Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium. Thus, the Vaughan Williams classification also coincides with the main myocardial targets of the antiarrhythmics, i.e., myocardial sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-channels or beta-adrenergic receptors.  The sodium-channel blockade induced by class-I substances is enhanced with increasing heart rates. Thus, class-I antiarrhythmics can be subclassified as substances showing a more exponential, an approximately linear, or rather saturated block-frequency relation. Class-III antiarrhythmics (potassium-channel blockade) can be further differentiated according to the component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) which is inhibited by a drug.  Class-III substances inhibiting the slowly activating IKs component are currently under investigation and are expected to show a direct rate dependence. Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium.  Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium The classification of antiarrhythmic agents according to Vaughan Williams is based on electrophysiological findings in isolated heart muscle and defines four classes of drug actions. Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the b-adrenoceptor blockers. Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone.  Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.  These are classified according to their electrophysiological effects observed in isolated cardiac tissues in vitro (Vaughan Williams, 1989). Fast sodium channel blockers (class I) which reduce the upstroke velocity of the action potential are usually subclassified into three groups, class I A-C, according to their effect on the action potential duration. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (class II) exert their effects by antagonizing the electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines. Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg amiodarone) prolong the action potential and slow calcium channel blockers (class IV) suppress the calcium inward current and calcium-dependent action potentials.

This study provides the first description of increased expression of miRNA miR-155 and miR-146a in RA In this study we investigated the expression, regulation, and function of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and RA synovial tissue The objective of this study was to identify the expression pattern of microRNA-146 (miR-146) in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) This study shows that miR-146 is expressed in RA synovial tissue and that its expression is induced by stimulation with TNFalpha and IL-1beta pregulated miR-146a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy and disease control individuals, and the expression of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, miR-16, and microRNA let-7a was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR Rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited between 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold increases in miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, and miR-16 expression, whereas let-7a expression was not significantly different compared with healthy control individuals Our data also suggest a possible mechanism contributing to rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, whereby miR-146a expression is increased but unable to properly function, leading to prolonged tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in patients with rheumatoid arthritis Repression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK-1 in THP-1 cells resulted in up to an 86% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, implicating that normal miR-146a function is critical for the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production icroRNA-124a is a key regulator of proliferation and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 secretion in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis We found that miR-124a levels significantly decreased in RA synoviocytes as compared with OA synoviocytes Induction of miR-124a in RA synoviocytes significantly suppressed the production of the CDK-2 and MCP-1 proteins he results of this study suggest that miR-124a is a key miRNA in the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of RA synoviocytes iR-223 is overexpressed in T-lymphocytes of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Although a multifactorial pathogenesis has been hypothesized, the precise mechanisms leading to the disease are still poorly understood at the molecular level. miRNA expression profile analysis highlighted that miR-223 is the only miRNA that is strikingly deregulated in peripheral T-lymphocytes from RA patients compared with healthy donors In summary, our data provide a first characterization of the miRNA expression profiles of peripheral T-lymphocytes of RA patients, identifying miR-223 as overexpressed in CD4(+) naive T-lymphocytes from these individuals Altered microRNA expression profile with miR-146a upregulation in CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis The role of miR-146a overexpression in regulating T cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry We have detected increased miR-146a in CD4+ T cells of RA patients and its close correlation with TNF-alpha levels. Our findings that miR-146a overexpression suppresses T cell apoptosis indicate a role of miR-146a in RA pathogenesis and provide potential novel therapeutic targets icroRNA-146a expresses in interleukin-17 producing T cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients Six miRNAs, let-7a, miR-26, miR-146a/b, miR-150, and miR-155 were significantly up regulated in the IL-17 producing T cells These results indicated that miR-146a was associated with IL-17 expression in the PBMC and synovium in RA patients polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), a target gene of miR-146a, is associated with rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility MicroRNA-146a was found to be increased in synovial fibroblasts, synovial tissue and PBMC from patients with RA This is the first study that addresses association of a variant in a target of miR-146a, IRAK1 gene, with RA susceptibility ltered expression of microRNA-203 in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and its role in fibroblast activation Previously, we described increased expression of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and showed a repressive effect of miR-155 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) The current results demonstrate methylation-dependent regulation of miR-203 expression in RASFs  Importantly, they also show that elevated levels of miR-203 lead to increased secretion of MMP-1 and IL-6 via the NF-ÎºB pathway and thereby contribute to the activated phenotype of synovial fibroblasts in RA iR-124a as a key regulator of proliferation and MCP-1 secretion in synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis Transfection of miR-124a into RA synoviocytes significantly suppressed their proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase It is proposed that miR-124a is a key miRNA in the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of RA synoviocytes, and has a therapeutic potential Expression of miR-146a and miR-16 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and their correlation to the disease activity The elevated expression levels of miR-146a and miR-16 are correlated to RA disease activity, suggesting their value in assessment of the clinical disease activity of RA iR-346 controls release of TNF-Î± protein and stability of its mRNA in rheumatoid arthritis via tristetraprolin stabilization Using a microarray, we found two miRNAs, miR-125b and miR-939 predicted to target the 3'-UTR of TNF-Î± mRNA, to be up-regulated in RA FLS in response to LPS, but their repression did not restore mature TNF-Î± expression in FLS We showed previously that miR-346, which is upregulated in LPS-activated FLS, inhibited Btk expression that stabilized TNF-Î± mRNA Different expression patterns of mir-146a, miRNA-155, miRNA-124a, mir-203, mir-223, mir-346, mir-132, mir-363, mir-498, mir-15a, and mir-16 were documented in several tissue sample types of RA patients own-regulation of microRNA-34a* in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts promotes apoptosis resistance Basal expression levels of miR-34a* were found to be reduced in synovial fibroblasts from RA patients compared to osteoarthritis patients, whereas levels of miR-34a, miR-34b/b*, and miR-34c/c* did not differ Our data provide evidence of a methylation-specific down-regulation of proapoptotic miR-34a* in RASFs dentification of microRNA-221/222 and microRNA-323-3p association with rheumatoid arthritis via predictions using the human tumour necrosis factor transgenic mouse model miR-seq demonstrated that TghuTNF-SF exhibit a distinct pathogenic profile with 22 significantly upregulated and 30 significantly downregulated miR Validation assays confirmed the dysregulation of miR-223, miR-146a and miR-155 previously associated with human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology, as well as that of miR-221/222 and miR-323-3p the authors identified miR-221/222 and miR-323-3p as novel dysregulated miR in RA SF Further association studies may contribute to determining the role of miR-146a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in immune-mediated diseases iR-146a polymorphism is associated with asthma but not with systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Mexican patients. verexpression of microRNA-223 in rheumatoid arthritis synovium controls osteoclast differentiation MicroRNA-223 (miR-223) is reported to play critical roles in osteoclastogenesis MiR-223 is intensely expressed in RA synovium, and overexpression of miR-223 suppresses osteoclastogenesis in vitro This study demonstrates the possibility of gene therapy with miR-223 to treat bone destruction in RA patients MiR-223 was more highly expressed in RA synovium than in osteoarthritis (OA) synovium due to the increased number of miR-223-positive cells in RA synovium ssociation of pre-miRNA-146a rs2910164 and preâmiRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphisms and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis Our findings demonstrated that the hsa-mir-499 rs3746444, but not mir-146a rs2910164, polymorphism is associated with an increased RA risk in a sample of the Iranian population umor necrosis factor Î±-induced microRNA-18a activates rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts through a feedback loop in NF-ÎºB signaling To elucidate whether the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-17-92 contributes to the activated phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs We found that TNFÎ± induces the expression of miR-17-92 in RASFs in an NF-ÎºB-dependent manner Using reporter gene assays, we identified the NF-ÎºB pathway inhibitor TNFÎ±-induced protein 3 as a new target of miR-18a Our data suggest that the miR-17-92-derived miR-18a contributes to cartilage destruction and chronic inflammation in the joint through a positive feedback loop in NF-ÎºB signaling, with concomitant up-regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes and mediators of inflammation in RASFs As inflammation and joint damage are the main hallmarks of RA, we focused on the three miRNAs, miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-223, whose functions have been studied in both the processes and the pathogenic role investigated in the experimental models Focusing on the role of miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-223 in RA pathogenesis emphasizes the intertwined relationships between bone homeostasis and immunity, and the prominent role of monocytes in RA In a final perspective section we discuss the potential impact of therapeutic miR-155 modulation in RA correlation between whole blood and PBMC expression levels of miR-155 and miR-146a in healthy controls and rheumatoid arthritis patients We demonstrated a highly significant linear correlation between miR-146a and miR-155 expression in PBMC and whole blood, from both healthy individuals and RA patients. expression of specific microRNAs (miRNA) in peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMC), particularly miR-146a and miR-155, is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) icroRNA-323-3p with clinical potential in rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and ectopic pregnancy It has been shown that miR-323-3p associates with the

In the classical form it is characterized by a typical triad (confusion, oculomotor disturbance and ataxia), however, in the majority of the cases only confusion is present.  Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neurological disorder characterized by mental confusion, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia.  The classic triad consists of encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction and gait ataxia but is not seen in a majority of patients. After frequent vomiting, he presented with mental status changes, ocular abnormalities, and truncal ataxia (the classic triad). Wernicke's encephalopathy is a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and confusion seen in alcoholics with dietary vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. Wernicke encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency in the central nervous system, and is defined by the triad of confusional symptoms, ocular alterations and ataxia. The classical triad of clinical symptoms described by Wernicke (gait ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion) are found in only a third of patients upon initial examination. It was found that only 0.4% of the population studied had the classical triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy, namely confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. The triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy--global confusional state, ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus, and ataxia--is occasionally seen in chronic alcoholics and is often attenuated by immediate thiamine treatment. Only six presented with the Wernicke's encephalopathy clinical triad (mental status changes, ocular signs, and ataxia) at neurologic onset; nine eventually demonstrated this triad.

5c88550075a4a5d219000008	List 3 apoE mimetics.	Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability.  Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2).  ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors.

The NanoString nCounter Platform is a new and promising technology for measuring nucleic acid abundances. It has several advantages over PCR-based techniques, including avoidance of amplification, direct sequence interrogation and digital detection for absolute quantification. These features minimize aspects of experimental error and hold promise for dealing with challenging experimental conditions such as archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. However, systematic inter-sample technical artifacts caused by variability in sample preservation, bio-molecular extraction and platform fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data.RESULTS: To facilitate this process and to address these issues for NanoString datasets, we have written a pre-processing package called NanoStringNorm in the R statistical language.

518cb5ab310faafe08000008	Which are the best treatment options to treat Helicobacter pylori?	Triple therapy, which has been the mainstay of treatment in many countries over the last decade, now has suboptimal results in many parts of the world. equential therapy and quadruple therapy (either bismuth-based or non-bismuth-based) are the best current options to replace initial treatment with triple therapy. olecular tests can be used to detect H. pylori and clarithromycin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance in gastric biopsies without necessitating culture. In regions of high clarithromycin resistance, such as France, sequential treatment or bismuth-containing quadruple therapies are replacing standard triple therapies for the first-line empirical treatment. The evidence in favour of bismuth compounds for treating infected children is still not clear. Chitosan microspheres with multiple Eudragit L100 cores were easily prepared by a new emulsification/coagulation encapsulating method. the multi-core chitosan microspheres could serve as a satisfactory vehicle for stomach-specific delivery of hydrophilic antibiotics. Treatment consisted of a one-week regimen containing a PPI twice daily, amoxicillin (A) 1 g twice daily and rifabutin (R) 300 mg once daily (PPI-AR). Pretreatment antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin and A was evaluated using a validated epsilometer test. four different strategies for prevention of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage: 1) test for H. pylori and treatment, if positive; 2) proton pump inhibitor maintenance; 3) no preventive treatment; 4) empirical H. pylori eradication immediately after bleeding. Empirical H. pylori eradication was the dominant strategy: its estimated rate of recurrent bleeding was lower (6.1%) than those of strategies 1 (7.4%), 2 (11.1%), and 3 (18.4%) and it was the least expensive strategy. The results remained stable when variables were changed inside a wide range of plausible values. In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, empirical treatment of H. pylori infection immediately after feeding is restarted is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing recurrent hemorrhage.

550316a6e9bde69634000029	Which diseases have been associated with the PTPN22 620W allele?	The frequency of the minor allele (620W) was significantly higher in GPA patients than in controls [Pâ=â0.005, Ï(2â)=â7.858, odds ratio (OR)â=â1.91], while no statistically significant association was found with MPA or CSS. Among GPA patients, the 620W allele was particularly enriched in ANCA-positive patients as compared with controls (Pâ=â0.00012, Ï(2â)=ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½14.73, ORâ=â2.31) The PTPN22 620W allele confers susceptibility to the development of GPA (but not of MPA or CSS), and particularly of its ANCA-positive subset The PTPN22 620W allele is a risk factor for Wegener's granulomatosis Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders The PTPN22 620W allele frequency was significantly increased in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive WG patients compared with healthy controls The PTPN22 620W allele appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of WG, and ANCA positivity seems to be the hallmark Rheumatoid arthritis seropositive for the rheumatoid factor is linked to the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22-620W allele The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes for lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase LYP, involved in the negative regulation of early T-cell activation. An association has recently been reported between the PTPN22-620W functional allele and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF+) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among other autoimmune diseases A functional variant (R620W) of the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22) has now been conclusively shown to confer approximately two-fold risk for seropositive RA as well as several other autoimmune disorders the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto thyroiditis The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). The risk of developing RA later in life in patients with type 1 DM may be attributed, in part, to the presence of the 620W PTPN22 allele, suggesting that this risk factor may represent a common pathway for the pathogenesis of these 2 diseases. The minor allele of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2476601) in the PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22) gene has been reported to be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis and vitiligo. An association has recently been reported between the PTPN22-620W functional allele and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF+) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among other autoimmune diseases The minor allele of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2476601) in the PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22) gene has been reported to be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis and vitiligo The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) PTPN22 620W risk allele was associated with ACPA production [odds ratio (OR)â=â2.21, 95% CI 1.4, 3.4, Pâ<â0.0001] An association has recently been reported between the PTPN22-620W functional allele and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF+) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among other autoimmune diseases	[['type 1 diabetes'], ['seropositive rheumatoid arthritis'], ['systemic lupus erythematosus'], ['Hashimoto thyroiditis'], ["Wegener's granulomatosis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis)"]]
570921e4cf1c325851000017	In which genomic regions are Alu enriched?	There are regions such as the four homeobox gene clusters, which are nearly devoid of these repeats that contrast with repeat dense regions in other transcriptionally active regions of the genome. These elements are more clustered in genes which are involved in metabolism, transport, and signaling processes. In contrast, they are significantly fewer in genes coding for information pathway components as well as structural proteins. This bias in Alu distribution is independent of the effect of Alu density of the flanking genomic region and is also not affected by the GC content of the gene and its upstream and downstream regions. The relative proportions of Alu subfamilies (Alu J, Alu S, and Alu Y) are not significantly different in genes with high Alu density belonging to the functional categories of transport, metabolism, and signaling. We suggest that Alu elements might be involved in regulatory mechanisms and are therefore differentially selected in primate genomes. Sequence analysis demonstrated these "young" Alu insertions represented gene conversion events of pre-existing ancient Alu elements or independent parallel insertions of older Alu elements in the same genomic region.  This study suggests that the majority of Alu insertions in primate genomes are the products of unique evolutionary events. Our screening of the Alu insertion loci also resulted in the recovery of several "young" Alu elements that resided at orthologous positions in nonhuman primate genomes.

551829a76487737b43000009	List the diseases for which there are point-of-care breath tests	Additionally, we try to clarify controversial issues concerning possible experimental malpractice in the field, and propose ways to translate the basic science results as well as the mechanistic understanding to tools (sensors) that could serve as point-of-care diagnostics of cancer. Point of care monitoring of hemodialysis patients with a breath ammonia measurement device based on printed polyaniline nanoparticle sensors.  Excellent intraindividual correlations were demonstrated between breath ammonia and BUN (0.86 to 0.96), which demonstrates the possibility of using low cost point of care breath ammonia systems as a noninvasive means of monitoring kidney dysfunction and treatment. Recently, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has emerged as an important biomarker for the assessment and management of asthma. Here we discuss the potential of adapting a technology from the electronics industry, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, for diagnosis of multiple markers of sepsis in real time, using non-invasive assays of exhaled breath condensate.  Together these data indicate that FeNO testing has an important role in the assessment and management of adult asthma.  Measurement of acetone in human breath samples has been previously shown to provide significant non-invasive diagnostic insight into the control of a patient's diabetic condition.   Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and treatment response. These animal model results suggest that exhaled breath can be used as a point-of-care tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis. Point-of-care breath test for biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis. RATIONALE: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath provide biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB) because Mycobacterium tuberculosis manufactures VOC metabolites that are detectable in the breath of infected patients.  CONCLUSIONS: A six-minute point-of-care breath test for volatile biomarkers accurately identified subjects with active pulmonary TB. Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) can measure volatile compounds in breath on-line in real time and has the potential to provide accurate breath tests for a number of inflammatory, infectious and metabolic diseases, including diabetes. Breath analysis by SIFT-MS offers a rapid, reproducible and easily performed measurement of acetone concentration in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes.  IGR is a new approach for non-invasive cardiac output measurement in mechanically ventilated individuals, but requires further investigation for clinical use. The liver metabolic breath test relies on measuring exhaled (13) C tagged methacetin, which is metabolized only by the liver. Measuring this liver-specific substrate by means of molecular correlation spectroscopy is a rapid, non-invasive method for assessing liver function at the point-of-care.  Our recent findings regarding the ability of point-of-care (13) C MBT to assess the hepatic functional reserve in patients with acute and chronic liver disease are reviewed along with suggested treatment algorithms for common liver disorders. 13[C]-urea breath test as a novel point-of-care biomarker for tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The non-invasive real-time BreathID GBT reliably assesses changes in liver glucose metabolism, and the degree of insulin resistance.  DISCUSSION: The LiMAx test can validly determine liver function capacity and is feasible in every clinical situation. A P(ET,CO(2)) of >or=36 mmHg may reliably exclude PE. Accuracy is augmented by combination with Wells score. P( ET,CO(2)) should be prospectively compared to D-dimer in accuracy and simplicity to exclude PE. Point-of-care continuous (13)C-methacetin breath test improves decision making in acute liver disease: results of a pilot clinical trial. CONCLUSION: The (13)C-MBT provides a rapid, non-invasive assessment of liver function in acute severe liver disease of diverse etiologies.  CONCLUSION: The determination of CO by IGR and CWD revealed a good agreement and reproducibility with a low rate of impossible measurements, suggesting that IGR and CWD can be used interchangeably in the clinical setting. BACKGROUND: Exhaled NO (FE(NO)) is a useful biomarker for the monitoring of asthma control and response to therapy.  A high percentage of patients with different severities of asthma and regardless of their treatment with ICS and current smoking habit (current and/or ex-smokers) had highly elevated FE(NO) values, suggesting that their current therapy was possibly insufficient to control the underlying degree of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. H. pylori-positive status was defined by positivity on at least 2 tests: a commercial H. pylori stool antigen enzyme immunoassay, an immunoglobulin G antibody enzyme immunoassay, and the C-urea breath test End-tidal carbon dioxide measurements in children with acute asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive bedside measurement of EtCO2 values among children with acute asthma is feasible.  Review article: the assessment of liver function using breath tests. The recent development of a real-time, point-of-care liver function breath test has made it straightforward to assess the metabolic function of the liver. RESULTS: The (13)C-methacetin breath test enables accurate follow-up of patients with acute or chronic liver damage, where overall hepatic function is significantly suppressed by known causes of liver disorders, including acute, sub-acute or chronic conditions.  CONCLUSIONS: Breath testing that provides continuous quantification of methacetin metabolism may be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disorders.  A multi-center study in a multi-ethnic population compared the RAPIRUN urine antibody test with the (13)C-urea breath test (C-UBT) and a traditional serologic test, the high-molecular-weight cell-associated protein enzyme immunoassay (HM-CAP EIA).  CONCLUSION: EGA provided non-invasive, accurate, continuous, high-resolution COHb% measurements. Applying EGA to carboxyhaemoglobin dilution, we achieved RCV measurements with accuracy equivalent to that of CO-haemoximetry, with one-fifth of the COB infusion volume.  These results suggest that the IR device, which is small, light-weight, and rugged may enable the foreign gas uptake method to be used in clinical, field, and point-of-care settings for Q (T) measurement. UNLABELLED: The 13C-urea breath test provides non-invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection with the possibility of analysis at the point of care.  CONCLUSION: Fdlate, a variable of VCap, had a statistically better diagnostic performance in suspected PE than the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) gradient.   In conclusion, the investigated rebreathing system allows for a non-invasive determination of PBF at the bedside.  Non-invasive measurement of pulmonary blood flow during prone positioning in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 13C-urea breath test provides accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of active Helicobacter pylori infection and can document posttherapy cure.  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications. Breath analysis with FT-IR was fast and easy, and no sample preparation was needed. CONCLUSIONS: The Fd(late) is a valuable tool for bedside screening of PE in surgical patients.

52bf209303868f1b0600001a	What are the indications for alteplase?	In Japan, intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), was approved for an indication of ischemic stroke in 2005 on the basis of the results of a clinical trial with a unique dose of the drug (0.6 mg/kg).  Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited. The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children. To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients.  Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator improves outcomes in patients treated early after stroke but at the risk of causing intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is the only approved thrombolytic agent at present indicated for acute ischaemic stoke. This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from the manufacturer to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process. The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days. Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months. The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities. Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated. Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation.  Alteplase is the first thrombolytic drug to be approved in France for the treatment of ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptom onset. However, the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke suggests that alteplase is the most promising treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.   To determine whether cryopreserved solutions of the thrombolytic agent alteplase could be used as a safe, effective, and economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in patients presenting with occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). Alteplase has been reported as an efficacious alternative to urokinase for treatment of occluded CVADs.  Patients presenting with occluded CVADs received a sufficient volume of the thawed alteplase solution to fill the occluded catheter(s).  Cryopreserved 1-mg/mL aliquots of alteplase are safe and effective in the clearance of occluded CVADs when stored at -20 degrees C for 30 days. The ability to cryopreserve alteplase aliquots makes it an economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in the setting of CVAD occlusion. Of the thrombolytic agents and therapeutic protocols in use, alteplase 100 mg/2 hours seems to be the best compromise between the risk of bleeding and efficacy in reducing pulmonary resistances by 30 to 40% and relatively early pulmonary revascularisation of 40-50%.  To explore the best regimen of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism(APE), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-h infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, Alteplase (rt-PA) and urokinase(UK).  A 2 h regimen of rt-PA or UK showed reliable efficacy and safety for treatment of APE. The indication of thrombolytic therapy can be extended. Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase. Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries.  Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min. A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI. An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention. Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period. Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis. However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease. Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate.  Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI. The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate. Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion. However, its use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as extensively documented. Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are scarce. Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism. The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA).  In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients. Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not proven in a satisfactory manner. Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more readily than occlusive thrombi. For this indication the optimal dose regimens for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not established.  To save 1 year of life, the costs of thrombolytic therapy using intravenous streptokinase, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) or anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex) under standard restricted indication criteria, vary from 1000 pounds British sterling to 1700 pounds British sterling in the UK, SEK3090 to 9660 in Scandinavia and $US35 000 to 800 000 in the US, depending on time delay in starting treatment after pain onset, size of infarct, thrombolytic agents used, study methodology, lists of clinical events considered in cost counting and the discount rate. Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis. Further studies are needed to define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication. Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension.  The local treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively.  More recently, new drugs like alteplase, reteplase, lanoteplase and saruplase have been a breakthrough in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children Some acute ischemic strokes (before the 3rd hour) could be treated with alteplase if there is no absolute or relative contraindication for thrombolysis. Alteplase and reteplase are the most efficient thrombolytics despite a higher risk of cerebral bleeding.

5c6ffa257c78d69471000056	Please list the 4 genes involved in Sanfilippo syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS-III).	This disease is a complex of four conditions caused by dysfunctions of one of genes coding for lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of heparan sulfate: SGSH (coding for heparan N-sulfatase) - causing MPS IIIA, NAGLU (coding for alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase) - causing MPS IIIB, HGSNAT (coding for acetyl CoA alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase) - causing MPS IIIC), and GNS (coding for N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase) - causing MPS IIID. MPS III results from a deficiency in one of the four enzymes involved in the heparan sulfate degradation, with sulfamidase (SGSH), Î±-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), acetyl-coenzyme A: Î±-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS) being deficient respectively in MPS IIIA, MPS IIIB, MPS IIIC and MPS IIID.

The recent discovery of immune checkpoints inhibitors, especially anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies, has opened new scenarios in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and this new class of drugs has achieved a rapid development in the treatment of this disease.

5e4949d36d0a277941000006	List cohesinopathies	Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies. These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes.  A new study identifies homozygous missense mutations in SGOL1, which encodes a component of the cohesin complex, in a newly described disorder termed Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome. These findings implicate cohesin in the regulation of intrinsic cardiac and intestinal rhythm and further expand the growing group of disorders termed the cohesinopathies.

5ac7185f0340b9f058000004	Which cellular functions are affected by lncRNA H19 in the heart?	In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.  In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3, which might provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. LncRNA H19 inhibits autophagy by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The long non-coding RNA H19 promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis in dilated cardiomyopathy. H19 knockdown in the myocardium of DCM rats attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved left ventricular structure and function. Adriamycin treatment was associated with elevated H19 and miR-675 expression and increased apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Moreover, H19 knockdown was found to increase PA2G4 expression and suppress apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin. In conclusion, our study suggests that H19/miR-675 axis is involved in the promotion of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting PA2G4, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of adriamycin-induced DCM. Downregulation of long non-coding RNA H19 promotes P19CL6 cells proliferation and inhibits apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation via miR-19b-modulated Sox6. Biological function analysis showed that knockdown of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis. H19 suppressed miR-19b expression and miR-19b targeted Sox6, which inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in P19CL6 cells during late-stage cardiac differentiation. Downregulation of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation by regulating the negative role of miR-19b in Sox6 expression, which suggested that the manipulation of H19 expression could serve as a potential strategy for heart disease. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. A knockdown of H19 in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of NOTCH1 and decreased the level of RUNX2 and BMP2, 2 downstream targets repressed by NOTCH1. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented H19-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells Long noncoding RNA H19 controls DUSP5/ERK1/2 axis in cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. H19 ectopic overexpression reduces DUSP5 abundance and increases the proliferation of cardiac fibroblast, whereas H19 silencing causes the opposite effects. In a broader perspective, these results demonstrated that LncRNA H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.

531375a6e3eabad021000011	which are the risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and can detect myocardial replacement fibrosis (anindependent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes) using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).  J wave is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The J wave may be a risk factor for SCA in patients with HCM. Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was the most common risk factor present (alone or in combination with other markers) in patients experiencing primary prevention interventions (17 of 26 [65%]). Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was most frequently associated with appropriate interventions. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that LGE has incremental value in addition to clinical risk factors for risk stratification and management of patients with HC. Fibrosis as detected by CMR should be evaluated as an additional risk factor to further delineate risk of SCD in carriers of an HCM causing mutation. Nonsustained VT was the only predictive risk factor (RF) for an appropriate ICD intervention in the PP (positive predictive value 22%, negative predictive value 96%). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia seems to be the most predictive RF for appropriate device discharges.  However, LGE was strongly associated with surrogates of arrhythmia and remained a significant associate of subsequent SCD and/or ICD discharge after controlling for other variables. If replicated, LGE may be considered an important risk factor for sudden death in patients with HCM. In conclusion, our cohort study results do not support LVOTO as an independent risk factor for SD in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The appearance of a "hump" at the ST segment during exercise testing appears to be a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM. However, further studies are necessary to validate this finding in larger populations and to elucidate the mechanism of the appearance of the "hump." The ICD is definitely indicated for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients with HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest with documented ventricular fibrillation, or experienced one or more episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. A number of risk markers are used to assess the magnitude of risk, including family history of premature sudden death; extreme left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (> 30 mm) in young patients; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter electrocardiographic recording; unexplained (not neurally mediated) syncope, particularly in young patients; and blood pressure decrease or inadequate increase during upright exercise. Measured risk factors for sudden death included family history of sudden death, massive left ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, and unexplained prior syncope. The following risk factors were analyzed: 1) previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 2) family history of sudden cardiac death; 3) high-risk genetic mutations; 4) syncope; 5) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 6) hypotensive response to exercise; and 7) marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Family history of sudden death was associated with a positive predictive value of 25% for appropriate therapies, 40% for syncope and 50% for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value.  It is concluded that there is an association of the mutation Arg719Trp in the beta-myosin heavy chain with sudden cardiac death in a young child.

5363bad27d100faa0900000e	Which are the most abundant human lincRNA?	One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. Because viruses borrow molecular mechanisms from their hosts, we searched highly abundant human long-noncoding RNAs and identified putative ENE-like structures in metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and multiple endocrine neoplasia-Î² (MENÎ²) RNAs.  MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to have epigenetic regulatory function in humans, including HOTAIR and XIST. metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis. It is highly abundant, its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes, and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution.

554143ad182542114d000004	List available methods for transmembrane protein topology prediction.	HMMpTM: improving transmembrane protein topology prediction using phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence. Our method integrates a novel feature in transmembrane protein topology prediction, which results in improved performance for topology prediction and reliable prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. The method is freely available at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/HMMpTM MetaTM - a consensus method for transmembrane protein topology prediction. A novel TM consensus method, named MetaTM, is proposed in this work. MetaTM is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six TM topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. On a large data set comprising 1460 sequences of TM proteins with known topologies and 2362 globular protein sequences it correctly predicts 86.7% of all topologies. CONCLUSION: Combining several TM predictors in a consensus prediction framework improves overall accuracy compared to any of the individual methods. Our proposed SVM-based system also has higher accuracy than a previous consensus predictor. MetaTM is made available both as downloadable source code and as DAS server at http://MetaTM.sbc.su.se We present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. We present the results of applying these tools to a number of complete genomes. Source code, data sets and a web server are freely available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/ Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to the tasks of transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction. In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions We report a relative improvement of 13% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides HMM_RA: an improved method for alpha-helical transmembrane protein topology prediction This paper presents a Hidden Markov Model (referred to as HMM_RA) that can predict the topology of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins with improved performance. HMM_RA adopts the same structure as the HMMTOP method, which has five modules: inside loop, inside helix tail, membrane helix, outside helix tail and outside loop. Each module consists of one or multiple states A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins The algorithms presented here, are easily implemented in any kind of a Hidden Markov Model, whereas the prediction method (HMM-TM) is freely available for academic users TMHMM, the current state-of-the-art method, has less than 52% accuracy in topology prediction on one set of transmembrane proteins of known topology. Based on the observation that there are functional domains that occur preferentially internal or external to the membrane, we have extended the model of TMHMM to incorporate functional domains, using a probabilistic approach originally developed for computational gene finding. Our extension is better than TMHMM in predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins. As prediction of functional domain improves, our system's prediction accuracy will likely improve as well Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions HMMpTM: improving transmembrane protein topology prediction using phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction.

A parent report of comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety was associated with a high rate of use, with 80% receiving â¥ 1 psychotropic medication Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of a modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD. the present study is the first controlled trial to demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS. This pilot, randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skills Intervention (MASSI) program in a sample of 30 adolescents with ASD and anxiety symptoms of moderate or greater severity. These findings suggest MASSI is a feasible treatment program and further evaluation is warranted. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). the Coping Cat program (cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD. The intent of this article is to explore the efficacy of both the literal and concrete externalization aspects within narrative therapy, and the implementation of interactive metaphors as a combined psychotherapeutic approach for decreasing anxiety with people who present with high-functioning autism. This paper reports a case series of children and adolescents with ASD and an anxiety disorder who were treated with a standard cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) rationale adapted to take account of the neuropsychological features of ASD. children with moderate autistic symptomology (per SRS-P) were significantly more likely to improve from family CBT (FCBT) than individual CBT (ICBT; ORÂ =Â 8.67) Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT. A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression. The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences. The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low. A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA) was evaluated. Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder.

534bb147aeec6fbd07000014	Which are the cardiac effects of thyronamines?	Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones. Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass.  Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively.  A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action.  In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart rate.

Here, we investigate protein interactions between NOTCH3 and other vascular Notch isoforms and characterize the effects of elevated NOTCH3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate that NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. We conclude that CADASIL mutants of NOTCH3 complex with NOTCH1, 3, and 4, slow NOTCH3 clearance, and that overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 protein interfere with key NOTCH-mediated functions in smooth muscle cells. In the vertebrate embryo, skeletal muscle is derived from the myotome of the somites. Notch1-3 demonstrate overlapping and distinct expression patterns in mouse somites. Notch1 and Notch2 have been shown to be inhibitors of skeletal myogenesis.  In this study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical staining pattern of four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and their ligands (Delta1 and Jagged1) in 14 synovial tissues obtained from 14 RA patients.  Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, used to regulate cell fate decisions. Four Notch receptors have been identified in man (Notch-1 to -4). All 4 receptors were expressed in the adult liver, with no significant differences in the levels of Notch-1, -2, and -4 messenger RNA (mRNA) between normal and diseased liver. However, Notch-3 expression appeared to be increased in diseased tissue.  We studied the immunohistochemical expression of NOTCH2 and its isoforms NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4 and the NOTCH2 primary ligand JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas. There are four different mammalian Notch receptors that can be activated by five cell surface ligands There are four mammalian Notch receptors that have only partially overlapping functions despite sharing similar structures and ligands.

5503263fe9bde69634000030	List three major features of the CCFDN syndrome.	Because of our experience in neuromuscular disorders, we choose six, frequent, autosomal recessive disorders for these clinical and genetic studies: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Lom (HMSNL), hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Russe (HMSNR), congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism syndrome (CCFDN), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2C (LGMD2C), congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is a recently described autosomal recessive developmental disorder.  Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease. Congenital Cataracts Facial Dysmorphism Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome is a complex developmental disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and course of ophthalmologic abnormalities in congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome in a genetically verified group of 9 patients. Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder that occurs in an endogamous group of Vlax Roma (Gypsies; refs. 1-3).  The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter. The CCFDN syndrome is a complex phenotype involving multiple systems, characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital cataracts, microcorneae, delayed early motor and intellectual development, hypogonadotrop hypogonadism, hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, and serious complications related to general anaesthesia.  Developmental abnormalities include congenital cataracts and microcorneae, primary hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, impaired physical growth, delayed early motor and intellectual development, mild facial dysmorphism and hypogonadism. Para-infectious rhabdomyolysis is a serious complication reported in an increasing number of patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy.  All patients showed a peripheral, demyelinating neuropathy and varying degrees of ataxia. In the older patients, muscular atrophy in distal muscles and facial dysmorphism was evident. Early-onset bilateral congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil could be found in all patients. All children had floppy eyelid syndrome and pseudoptosis. All patients had syndrome-associated nystagmus and congenital esotropia. Distant visual acuity could be classified as severe to moderate impairment, whereas near visual acuity was much better (mild to moderate impairment). Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder.  Peripheral nerve abnormalities in the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome. Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a novel developmental disorder in Gypsies maps to 18qter. We propose to refer to the syndrome as congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN).  The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features.  Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy.  Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a rare cause of parainfectious rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy. The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder. Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter	[['congenital cataracts'], ['facial dysmorphism'], ['peripheral neuropathy']]

55181d1e6487737b43000008	What are the breath test biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO), a key macrophage antimycobacterial mediator that ameliorates immunopathology, is measurable in exhaled breath in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, impaired pulmonary NO bioavailability is associated with more-severe disease and delayed mycobacterial clearance. Four KI windows corresponded with KI values of VOCs previously identified as biomarkers of pulmonary TB and metabolic products of M. tuberculosis, principally derivatives of naphthalene, benzene and alkanes.  Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide as a potential screening tool for pulmonary tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: While eNO measurement has limited value in the direct diagnosis of pulmonary TB, it may be worth developing and evaluating as a cost-effective replacement of chest X-ray in screening algorithms of pulmonary TB where X-ray is not available. 13[C]-urea breath test as a novel point-of-care biomarker for tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response.  RESULTS: Breath VOCs contained apparent biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis comprising oxidative stress products (alkanes and alkane derivatives) and volatile metabolites of M. tuberculosis (cyclohexane and benzene derivatives). Pulmonary tuberculosis may alter volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath because Mycobacteria and oxidative stress resulting from Mycobacterial infection both generate distinctive VOCs.  We conclude that volatile biomarkers in breath were sensitive and specific for pulmonary tuberculosis: the breath test distinguished between "sick versus well" i.e. between normal controls and patients hospitalized for suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis, and between infected versus non-infected patients i.e. between those whose sputum cultures were positive or negative for Mycobacteria. RESULTS: The concentrations of H202 and TBARs (1022.96+/-186.02 nM and 4.22+/-0. 80 microM, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis as compared with the controls (398.15+/-37.10 nM and 0.48+/-0.17 microM, respectively).  We conclude that volatile biomarkers in breath were sensitive and specific for pulmonary tuberculosis: the breath test distinguished between "sick versus well" i. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath may contain biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis derived from the infectious organism (metabolites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and from the infected host (products of oxidative stress). Volatile biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis in the breath. Breath VOCs contained apparent biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis comprising oxidative stress products (alkanes and alkane derivatives) and volatile metabolites of M.

5a888b56d543831129000002	What induces Arabidopsis ROF1 expression?	Endogenous ROF1 was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media (0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl) at both an mRNA and protein level.  Arabidopsis ROF1 (AtFKBP62) is a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase and a member of the FKBP (FK506 binding protein) family. ROF1 expression is induced by heat stress and developmentally regulated. Exposure of plants to low levels of MDA using a recently developed protocol powerfully upregulated many genes on a cDNA microarray with a bias towards those implicated in abiotic/environmental stress (e.g. ROF1 and XERO2). Arabidopsis immunophilins ROF1 (AtFKBP62) and ROF2 (AtFKBP65) exhibit tissue specificity, are heat-stress induced, and bind HSP90. The abundance of ROF1 mRNA increased several-fold under stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to elevated NaCl levels.	[['Wounding'], ['Elevated NaCl levels'], ['Heat']]

56c703445795f9a73e00000a	Which histone modification discriminates between active and poised enhancers?	Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancer Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers. We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury. However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury. Recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3 Such permissive binding was largely restricted to open-chromatin regions showing histone modification marks characteristic of active enhancer and promoter regions, whereas open-chromatin regions lacking such marks did not show permissive binding.  We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone The bivalent hypothesis posits that genes encoding developmental regulators required for early lineage decisions are poised in stem/progenitor cells by the balance between a repressor histone modification (H3K27me3), mediated by the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), and an activator modification (H3K4me3) Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.  Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity.	[['H3K4me1'], ['H3K27ac']]
5a67afb7b750ff445500000d	List main clinical features of the POEMS syndrome.	POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to a plasma cell dyscrasia. Recognition of a combination of peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorder, skin changes, papilledema, extravascular volume overload, sclerotic bone lesions, thrombocytosis, and Castleman disease is the first step in managing the disease. Treatment of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome should be directed at the underlying plasma cell clone with risk-adapted therapy based on the extent of the plasma cell disorder. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder. POEMS is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome, namely, Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, and Skin abnormalities. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) is a multisystem disorder with a good long-term prognosis. The association of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes forms a characteristic multisystem syndrome, Crow-Fukase syndrome, or acronym POEMS syndrome. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem disorder arising from underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is an uncommon condition related to a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an underlying plasma cell disorder. Pulmonary hypertension is one of the well-known clinical manifestations of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, occurring in approximately 25-30% of the affected individuals. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare disorder. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, a plasma cell dyscrasia associated with pulmonary hypertension, has been treated in the past with anticytokine strategies with a poor outcome. A 48-year-old man with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome had bilateral optic disc edema (ODE), bilateral cystoid macular edema (CME), anasarca, and elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A 39-year-old woman presented with polyneuropathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and skin changes, several of the many clinical features of the recently described POEMS syndrome. The acronym POEMS is derived from main features of the syndrome namely 'polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions'. POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome, represents a rare multisystem syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes. Polyneuropathy is often an initial manifestation of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome and therefore this disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition, commonly associated with Castleman disease, that manifests with progressive distal polyneuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, often accompanied by endocrinopathy, organomegaly, skin changes, sclerotic bone lesions, ascites, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. We report a case of a 64-year-old man with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) syndrome that had been previously misdiagnosed as systemic sclerosis. POEMS syndrome is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes. The POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammapathy, and skin changes) syndrome is a rare variant of plasma cell dyscrasia with multisystemic manifestations. a 39 year old woman presented with polyneuropathy hepatomegaly splenomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal protein and skin changes several of the many clinical features of the recently described poems syndrome in addition she had a castleman s disease angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of

therapy the patient had many clinical features of the described poems syndrome including sclerotic bone lesions a persistent lambda paraprotein and refractory ascites in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of refractory ascites. poems syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation associated with hematopoietic disorders such as multiple myeloma and castleman disease poems is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin abnormalities glomeruloid hemangiomas are considered to be a specific clinical marker of poems syndrome however while they are not pathognomonic their presence should raise suspicion of this syndrome or alert clinicians to its possible future development as these lesions can appear years before the onset of the syndrome we report the cases of 2 women with plasma cell dyscrasias and sudden onset of lesions with a vascular appearance and histologic findings consistent with glomeruloid hemangioma recognition of this vascular tumor is important for the early diagnosis of poems syndrome. poems syndrome is a rare conglomeration of disorders associated with plasma cell dyscrasia the acronym poems is derived from main features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions other clinical features include presence of sclerotic bone lesions castleman s disease papilledema pleural effusion edema ascites erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis myeloma is the most common plasma cell dyscrasia associated with poems syndrome renal involvement is rare and renal biopsy is characterized by glomerular involvement with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and endothelial injury we report a case of a 67 year old male who presented with clinical features satisfying the diagnostic criteria of poems syndrome and had rapidly progressive renal failure renal biopsy showed extensive interstitial infiltration by plasma cells and concomitant presence of classic polyarteritis nodosa although association with small vessel vasculitis has been reported in patients with poems syndrome to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of poems syndrome associated with medium sized vessel vasculitis. poems syndrome also known as crow

56a39a32496b62f23f000005	List packages for transcription factor binding sites' (TFBS) analysis available in R/Bioconductor	Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations. Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals. It is thus of great interest to distinguish TFs that directly regulate gene expression from those that are indirectly associated with gene expression. Graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, provide a powerful mathematical framework to infer different types of dependencies. However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small. Here, we develop a novel computational method, the Neighbourhood Consistent PC (NCPC) algorithms, which deal with these scenarios much more effectively than existing methods do. We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables. NCPC and DDGraph can also be applied to other problems involving highly correlated biological features. Both methods are implemented in the R package ddgraph, available as part of Bioconductor Here, we present MMDiff, a robust, broadly applicable method for detecting differences between sequence count data sets. Based on quantifying shape changes in signal profiles, it overcomes challenges imposed by the highly structured nature of the data and the paucity of replicates Supervised detection of conserved motifs in DNA sequences with cosmo We here introduce an algorithm, called cosmo, that allows this search to be supervised by specifying a set of constraints that the position weight matrix of the unknown motif must satisfy. Such constraints may be formulated, for example, on the basis of prior knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor in question. The algorithm is based on the same two-component multinomial mixture model used by MEME, with stronger reliance, however, on the likelihood principle instead of more ad-hoc criteria like the E-value dPattern: transcription factor binding site (TFBS) discovery in human genome using a discriminative pattern analysis.

5312280ce3eabad02100000a	Abnormalities in which chromosomes were linked to the Moyamoya disease?	Complex chromosome rearrangement of 6p25.3->p23 and 12q24.32->qter in a child with moyamoya. Routine karyotype demonstrated extra chromosomal material on 6p. Single nucleotide polymorphism microarray revealed a previously unreported complex de novo genetic rearrangement involving subtelomeric segments on chromosomes 6p and 12q. In terms of the genetics, recent literature suggests a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmission involving chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17 for familial MMD.  Furthermore, the current literature on familial MMD has pointed to a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmittance at loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17. Here, we report on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism.  We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB and BRCC3.  A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region.  Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5).  The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV).  Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics.  The gene responsible for NF1 is located on the chromosome region 17q11.2 and for familial moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.  Autosomal dominant moyamoya disease maps to chromosome 17q25.3. Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3. However, the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomal genotype showed that affected members had the same sequence of the Mitochondrial 3 portion of D-loop with Japanese patients.  Smith-Magenis syndrome and Moyamoya disease in a patient with del(17)(p11.2p13.1). We have employed a combination of aCGH, FISH, and MLPA to characterize an approximately 6.3 Mb deletion spanning chromosome region 17p11.2-p13.1 in this patient, with the proximal breakpoint within the RAI1 gene.  Moyamoya syndrome in a child with trisomy 12p syndrome. This report presents the first case of moyamoya syndrome with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12.  She had been prenatally diagnosed with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12 originating from her mother. She manifested developmental delay and some dysmorphic features of the face and limbs compatible with the clinical features of trisomy 12p. The genes encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 4 and TIMP2 span chromosomes 3p24.2-p26 and 17q25, respectively, which are the locations of familial moyamoya disease (FMMD) genes.  We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome with moyamoya syndrome. [Molecular screening for moyamoya disease by use of expressed sequence tag on chromosome 3p].  To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3. Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from moyamoya patients.  A novel susceptibility locus for moyamoya disease on chromosome 8q23. Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q. In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.3).  Considering the function, we selected nine genes as candidates from a total of 65 genes identified in the 9-cM region of D17S785-D17S836 in chromosome 17q25, and performed sequence analysis on the DNA samples obtained from a pedigree of familial moyamoya disease, which showed a complete linkage to the region by a haplotype analysis.  Linkage of familial moyamoya disease (spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis) to chromosome 17q25. The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2. CONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17q25. Recent genetic studies suggest some responsible genetic foci in chromosomes 3, 6 and 17. To further specify the genetic component of moyamoya disease, a linkage study of moyamoya disease using markers on chromosome 6, where the HLA gene is located, was performed.  Mapping of a familial moyamoya disease gene to chromosome 3p24.2-p26. A linkage was found between the disease and markers located at 3p24.2-26. We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.  The diagnosis of PWS was confirmed genetically by the method of fluorescence in situ hybridization which showed the deletion of chromosome 15.

5713bc991174fb1755000010	Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?	 GJB1 is currently considered to be associated with X-linked DI-CMT, and MPZ, INF2, DNM2, YARS, GNB4, NEFL, and MFN2 are associated with autosomal DI-CMT. Moreover, GDAP1, KARS, and PLEKHG5 are associated with RI-CMT. Identification of these genes is not only important for patients and families but also provides new information about pathogenesis A novel mutation in LRSAM1 causes axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with dominant inheritance Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) refers to a heterogeneous group of genetic motor and sensory neuropathies. According to the primary site of damage, a distinction is made between demyelinating and axonal forms (CMT1 and 2, respectively, when inherited as an autosomal dominant trait). Leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing protein 1 (LRSAM1) is a ubiquitin-protein ligase with a role in sorting internalised cell-surface receptor proteins. So far, mutations in the LRSAM1 gene have been shown to cause axonal CMT in three different families and can confer either dominant or recessive transmission of the disease We have identified a novel mutation in LRSAM1 in a small family with dominant axonal CMT Phenotypical features of the p.R120W mutation in the GDAP1 gene causing autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A) or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K). Most of these mutations present a recessive inheritance, but few autosomal dominant GDAP1 mutations have also been reported  Our findings highlight the relevance of dominantly transmitted p.R120W GDAP1 gene mutations which can cause an axonal CMT with a wide clinical profile A novel GDAP1 Q218E mutation in autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease There have been very few reports of GDAP1 mutations in autosomal dominant (AD) CMT Here, we report an AD CMT family with a novel Q218E mutation in the GDAP1 gene CMT type 1 (CMT1; MIM 118200) is a group of autosomal dominant-inherited demyelinating neuropathies with a disease onset at or after childhood. Five different subtypes have been identified based on different causative genes. Among them, CMT1A (MIM #118220) is most common and is usually associated with a duplication of a 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2, which includes peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22; MIM *601097) Mutations in the NF-L gene (NEFL) cause autosomal dominant neuropathies that are classified either as axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 2E (CMT2E) or demyelinating CMT type 1F (CMT1F) Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, LITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI and a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also cause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria) Mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin 2 cause dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2 to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia, Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families Here, we report a large family showing characteristic phenotypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A along with deafness in an autosomal dominant fashion. We detected a sequence variation (c.68C>G) co-segregating with the disease phenotype and leading to a T23R missense mutation in PMP22 The authors recently mapped an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT type 1 (CMT1C) to chromosome 16p13.1-p12.3 The authors identified missense mutations (G112S, T115N, W116G) in the LITAFgene (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor) in three CMT1C pedigrees We identified a novel neurofilament-light missense mutation (C64T) that causes the disease in a large Slovenian CMT2 family. This novel mutation shows complete co-segregation with the dominantly inherited CMT2 phenotype in our family Phenotypical features of the p.R120W mutation in the GDAP1 gene causing autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). A novel GDAP1 Q218E mutation in autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. A novel LRSAM1 mutation is associated with autosomal dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B. Mutations in the Dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or autosomal dominant (AD) Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene cause either autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4A or autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with vocal cord paresis A novel mutation in the GDAP1 gene is associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in an Amish family Phenotypical features of a Moroccan family with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease associated with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1 gene Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22.  OBJECTIVE: Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT).  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A) or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K).  Mutations in the NEFL gene were recently reported as a cause for autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E) linked to chromosome 8p21.  Mild functional differences of dynamin 2 mutations associated to centronuclear myopathy and Charcot-Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy. Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination.  Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated with neutropaenia or cataracts.  . A novel LRSAM1 mutation is associated with autosomal dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated with neutropaenia or cataracts.

56c6dd275795f9a73e000008	Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin?	H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. This result indicates that H3K36me3 is associated with both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin. Classical histone modifications associated with heterochromatin, including H3K9me2, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2, were distributed throughout both A and B chromosomes. In this review, available data will be evaluated concerning (1) the phylogenetic distribution of H3K9me as heterochromatin-specific histone modification and its evolutionary stability in relation to other epigenetic marks, (2) known families of H3K9 methyltransferases, (3) their responsibility for the formation of constitutive heterochromatin and (4) the evolution of Su(var)3-9-like and SUVH-like H3K9 methyltransferases  While these regions were furthermore largely devoid of the constitutive heterochromatin marker H3K9-me3, we observed rapid and widespread deposition of H3K27-me3 across latent KSHV genomes, a bivalent modification which is able to repress transcription in spite of the simultaneous presence of activating marks. Histone modifications in Arabidopsis- high methylation of H3 lysine 9 is dispensable for constitutive heterochromatin The recent discovery of the first histone Lys methyltransferase has allowed the identification of a molecular mechanism in which the specific methylation of histone H3 at Lys9 generates a binding site for heterochromatin-associated proteins. At the SUMO-1 labelled areas, the presence of HP1alpha protein, as well as of trimethylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 histone modifications, supports a role for SUMO-1 in constitutive heterochromatin organization. Surprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3). Constitutive heterochromatin during mouse oogenesis: the pattern of histone H3 modifications and localization of HP1alpha and HP1beta proteins. In fission yeast, heterochromatin formation requires RNAi and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC, composed of Clr4, Raf1, Raf2, Cul4, and Rik1.  Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-Lys9) by site-specific histone methyltransferases (Suv39h HMTases) marks constitutive heterochromatin.  H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage. In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the histone mark H3K27me3.

Nonetheless, infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological agents that have been approved for this group of patients.  In September 2013, the European Medicines Agency approved two infliximab biosimilars for treatment of adult and paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients, The introduction of infliximab into clinical practice is one of the most significant advances in the care of patients who have IBD. Infliximab has become an important part of the medical armamentarium to treat extraintestinal manifestations that often are refractory to other medications and are a significant cause of morbidity in these patients. Two other TNF inhibitors recently have demonstrated efficacy in CD: certolizumab pegol and adalimumab. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) has prepared clinical practice guidelines to help physicians prescribe corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for these patients.  lthough the TNF inhibitor infliximab is known to improve IBD outcomes in many different ways, several questions remain regarding the optimal way to employ this drug in the clinic,  Infliximab biosimilars for the treatment of IBD have been available in Europe and Asia for a few years and are expected to become available in the United States within the next 1 to 2 years	[['infliximab (IFX)'], ['adalimumab (ADA)']]
5543a1b2ee40ea110c000001	In what type(s) of plant organelles we can detect prolamellar bodies?	CPP1 depletion also causes reduced POR accumulation in etioplasts of dark-grown plants and as a result impairs the formation of prolamellar bodies, which subsequently affects chloroplast biogenesis upon illumination. Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) isolated from etiolated wheat seedlings were studied with the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy TEM analyses confirmed that PLBs of wheat leaf etioplasts also had an average diameter of appr. 1Î¼m etioplasts with prolamellar bodies (PLBs) and photoactive, 655nm emitting Pchlide form accumulated primarily in the basal leaf regions after 2 weeks of regeneration. When these latter leaves were illuminated with continuous light for 3 days, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts POR complex assembly (including LHPP and POR dimers) did not affect the formation of prolamellar bodies (PLBs) that function for efficient capture of light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. Etioplasts that develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark contain a highly organized lipid structure termed prolamellar body (PLB), which is the main site of accumulation of the ternary Pchlide:POR:NADPH complexes. During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms an aggregate of photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes localized to the prolamellar bodies within etioplasts. The content of the supramolecular light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase:protochlorophyllide) and the density of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts are decreased in the mutant. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts The most notable contributions of thin section electron microscopy include the elucidation of the 3-D organization of thylakoid membranes, the discovery of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts This resulted in the recovery of thylakoid membrane stacking in chloroplasts in the light, and the formation of prolamellar bodies and plastoglobuli in etioplasts in the dark. The prolamellar body (PLB) proteome of dark-grown wheat leaves was characterized. PLBs are formed not only in etioplasts but also in chloroplasts in young developing leaves during the night A fraction of highly purified prolamellar bodies was isolated from etioplasts of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. The highest specific activity of the enzyme in etiolated leaf tissue was confirmed to be in the fraction of prolamellar bodies. This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts and decreased thylakoid stacking in chloroplasts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed partially developed, agranal plastids in the dark-grown mutant, unlike wild-type seedlings that contain etioplasts with prolamellar bodies. Organization of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase in prolamellar bodies isolated from etiolated carotenoid-deficient wheat leaves as revealed by fluorescence probes. In fully etiolated leaves lamellae are absent and the prolamellar bodies become quite large, presumably because of inhibition of the fusion step which appears to require chlorophyll. POR is a peripheral membrane protein that accumulates to high levels in the prolamellar bodies of vascular plant etioplasts and is present at low levels in the thylakoid membranes of developing and mature plastids. This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition. The results presented in this paper are not consistent with the hypothesis that the molar ratio of MGDG/DGDG is responsible for the tubular structure of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts.

56d8b47a51531f7e33000004	What are the main clinical characteristics of Pendred syndrome?	Obligatory features are profound deafness in childhood and defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. Therefore, goiter is a common symptom. Hypoplasia of the cochlea is another feature. If a child has progressive sensorineural deafness and a widened vestibular aqueduct, it is important to consider a diagnosis of Pendred syndrome.  Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, Pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syndrome results from various mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene that cause production of an abnormal pendrin protein Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. It is caused by mutations in the PDS gene.  Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Aside from the branchio-otorenal syndrome, Pendred syndrome is the only other known genetic disorder with a widened vestibular aqueduct. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and sonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis in association with sensorineural hearing loss. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and widened vestibular aqueducts are characteristic features of Pendred's syndrome, which provides the opportunity to diagnose Pendred's syndrome clinically in the first few years of life, as has recently been suggested in a case report (Cremers et al., Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and a widend vestibular aqueduct in Pendred syndrome, Arch. Pendred syndrome is the most common syndromal form of deafness, yet the primary defect remains unknown. Pendred syndrome is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and ultrasonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis (elevated TSH, low T4/fT4, goitre or normal thyroid volume) in association with sensorineural hearing loss.

51486f7dd24251bc0500002e	Which scales are recommended by the American Heart Association for depression screening in cardiovascular patients? 	In 2008, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended a 2-step screening method, consisting of the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) followed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), for identifying depression in cardiovascular patients. The American Heart Association (AHA) statement has recommended routine screening for depression in coronary artery disease with a 2-stage implementation of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). A recent American Heart Association (AHA) Prevention Committee report recommended depression screening of all coronary heart disease patients using 2- and 9-item instruments from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) to identify patients who may need further assessment and treatment. Patients were screened for depression using a protocol identical to the one endorsed by the AHA in a cardiology community clinic in Elmhurst (Queens, New York). Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Depression screening in cardiac patients has been recommended by the American Heart Association, but the best approach remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nurse-administered versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression screening in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome.

5e2b0d167d50947c2f000002	Which disorders are caused by de novo mutations in ZSWIM6?	A Recurrent De Novo Nonsense Variant in ZSWIM6 Results in Severe Intellectual Disability without Frontonasal or Limb Malformations. A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.  We show that the c.2737C>T variant does not trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the ZSWIM6 mRNA in affected individual-derived cells. This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect. This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes. Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis. Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND) is a rare disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial, brain, and limb malformations, including frontonasal dysplasia, interhemispheric lipoma, agenesis of the corpus callosum, tibial hemimelia, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, and intellectual disability. Exome sequencing of one trio and two unrelated probands revealed the same heterozygous variant (c.3487C>T [p. Arg1163Trp]) in a highly conserved protein domain of ZSWIM6; this variant has not been seen in the 1000 Genomes data, dbSNP, or the Exome Sequencing Project. Sanger validation of the three trios confirmed that the variant was de novo and was also present in a fourth isolated proband. In situ hybridization of early zebrafish embryos at 24 hr postfertilization (hpf) demonstrated telencephalic expression of zswim6 and onset of midbrain, hindbrain, and retinal expression at 48 hpf. Immunohistochemistry of later-stage mouse embryos demonstrated tissue-specific expression in the derivatives of all three germ layers. qRT-PCR expression analysis of osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines available from two probands was suggestive of Hedgehog pathway activation, indicating that the ZSWIM6 mutation associated with AFND may lead to the craniofacial, brain and limb malformations through the disruption of Hedgehog signaling. A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect. We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C>T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations. Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis . A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect. A single recurrent heterozygous missense substitution in ZSWIM6, encoding a protein of unknown function, was previously shown to underlie this disorder in four unrelated cases.

589aec4778275d0c4a000037	Which are the types of viral meningitis?	Aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is characterized by meningeal inflammation that is not linked to identifiable bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The results indicate a considerable rate of herpesvirus infection in patients with aseptic meningitis, and that VZV is the most common herpesvirus to cause infection followed by HSV-1.  Detection of herpes viruses in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults with suspected viral meningitis in Malawi. Of these, 59 (32 %) had proven meningitis (bacterial, tuberculous or cryptococcal), 39 (21 %) had normal CSF and 14 (8 %) had aseptic meningitis. For the latter group, a herpes virus was detected in 9 (64 %): 7 (50 %) had EBV and 2 (14 %) had CMV, all were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive.  Results confirm that EV-specific RT-PCR can detect HRVs, and at a practical level, identify potential problems of interpretation if fecal samples are used for surrogate screening in cases of suspected viral meningitis.  Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can be divided into three species; HRV-A to HRV-C. Enteroviruses (EV) and parechoviruses (HPeV) are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and sepsis-like syndrome in neonates. Serous meningitis associated with primary genital herpes infection Aseptic meningitis is not an uncommon complication to primary genital herpes infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compared with other types of viral meningitis, HSV-2-meningitis is associated with a significant rate of neurological complications in the acute stage. In addition, some patients will suffer from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret's meningitis) later. We describe six patients, five women and one man, age 26-35 years, with aseptic meningitis caused by HSV-2. Viral meningitis due to echovirus types 6 and 9: epidemiological data from Western Australia. During the autumn of 1992, Western Australia experienced a large viral meningitis outbreak of dual aetiology.  Echovirus 9 caused 41% of cases and occurred mainly in the metropolitan areas of Western Australia whereas echovirus 6, which caused 37% of cases, was more widespread.  Sensitive virologic evaluation in suspected meningitis: study of a radioimmunotest for the detection of IgM antibodies against ECHO 9 and ECHO 11 viruses The majority of viral meningitis cases is known to be due to ECHO virus infections on one hand, and mumps on the other.  The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus which is transmitted to man by means of different species of mosquitoes and causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of illness in different regions of the Old World, including the Mediterranean Basin. Bearing in mind the high percentage of neurological complications found to exist in the most recent outbreaks of WNV infections recorded in the Mediterranean Basin (Bucharest, Algeria), it can be thought that the WNV plays some role in the factors contributing to viral meningitis and encephalitis which occur within the population of the areas at risk within Spain. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). We compared data obtained from patients with mumps meningitis and patients with aseptic meningitis caused by other viruses in order to identify mumps meningitis-specific cytokine/chemokine alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).METHODS: â We elucidated the cytokine/chemokine network based on the cytokine/chemokine profiles in CSF from children with mumps meningitis and meningitis due to other viral infections using multiplex cytokine measurement.

532c0c21d6d3ac6a3400001b	Which are the main methods for pharmacophore modelling?	protein interactions are becoming increasingly significant as potential drug targets; however, the rational identification of small molecule inhibitors of such interactions remains a challenge. Pharmacophore modelling is a popular tool for virtual screening of compound libraries, and has previously been successfully applied to the discovery of enzymatic inhibitors. However, the application of pharmacophore modelling in the field of protein:protein interaction inhibitors has historically been considered more of a challenge and remains limited. In this review, we explore the interaction mimicry by known inhibitors that originate from in vitro screening, demonstrating the validity of pharmacophore mapping in the generation of queries for virtual screening. We discuss the pharmacophore mapping methods that have been successfully employed in the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors.   a popular tool for virtual screening of libraries to identify novel active substances that can be potentially developed into drugs. While they have been applied for years on common drug targets, their application in the discovery of protein-protein interaction inhibitors remains limited. This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions. We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes. This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures. We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets. The best HypoGen pharmacophore model for ACC2 inhibitors (Hypo1_ACC2) consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic aliphatic and one hydrophobic aromatic feature, whereas the best pharmacophore (Hypo1_ACC1) for ACC1 consists of one additional hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) features. The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by various methods such as test set, decoy set and Cat-Scramble methodology. The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen several small-molecule databases, including Specs, NCI, ChemDiv and Natural product databases to identify the potential dual ACC inhibitors. The virtual hits were then subjected to several filters such as estimated [Formula: see text] value, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis. pharmacophore model has been developed using diverse classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors useful in the treatment of human tumours. Among the top 10 generated hypotheses, the second hypothesis, with one hydrogen bond acceptor, one ring aromatic and three hydrophobic features, was found to be the best on the basis of Cat Scramble validation as well as test set prediction (r(training) = 0.89, r(test) = 0.82). The model also maps well to the external test set molecules as well as clinically active molecules and corroborates the docking studies. Finally, 10 hits were identified as potential leads after virtual screening of ZINC database for EGFR TK inhibition.  In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the known Aurora-A inhibitors as well as identify new lead compounds against Aurora-A, 3D pharmacophore models were developed based on the known inhibitors.  computational methods for molecular design are well established in medicinal chemistry research, their application in the field of natural products is still not exhaustively explored. This article gives a short introduction into both the potential for the application of computer-assisted approaches, such as pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, docking, and neural networking to efficiently access the bioactive metabolites, and the requirements and limitations related to this specific field. The challenge is which selection criteria and/or multiple filtering tools to apply for a target-oriented isolation of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites. Application examples are provided where in silico tools and classical methods used by natural product scientists are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery.  pharmacophore models derived from protein binding site atoms without the inclusion of any ligand information have become more popular in virtual screening studies. However, the accuracy of protein-based pharmacophore models for reproducing the critical protein-ligand interactions has never been explicitly assessed.  Our results demonstrate that there are significant variations in the success of protein-based pharmacophore models to reproduce native contacts and consequently native ligand poses dependent on the details of the pharmacophore generation process. We show that the generation of optimized protein-based pharmacophore models is a promising approach for ligand pose prediction and pose rankings pharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target shared by a group of compounds. Pharmacophores also represent the spatial arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket. Structure based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure. The SBP methods that derive pharmacophore from protein-ligand complexes use the potential interactions observed between ligand and protein, whereas, the SBP method that aims to derive pharmacophore from ligand free protein, uses only protein active site information 3D pharmacophore methods are now commonly used as part of more complex workflows in drug discovery campaigns, and have been successfully and extensively applied in virtual screening (VS) approaches.

Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Preattachment embryos at different times after ovulation (Day 8: n = 9; Day 10: n = 12; Day 12: n = 15) were analyzed for Xist RNA expression using quantitative and qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

58add1d79ef3c34033000008	Which driver mutations have been identified for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)?	We found conservation of heterozygous K27M mutations in H3F3A (nâ=â4) or HIST1H3B (nâ=â3) across all primary, contiguous, and metastatic tumor sites in all DIPGs ACVR1 (nâ=â2), PIK3CA (nâ=â2), FGFR1 (nâ=â2), and MET (nâ=â1) were also intra-tumorally conserved  TP53 aberrations (nâ=â3 patients) varied by type and location between primary and metastatic tumors sites but were intra-tumorally conserved. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M--including H3.2K27M--mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (TP53/PPM1D) or specific growth factor pathways (ACVR1/PIK3R1).

58bfcb8702b8c60953000016	Which are the causes of the Koebner phenomenon?	Lichen sclerosus has been reported at sites of injury as a Koebner phenomenon.  Therefore, lower expression of keratinocyte-derived factors, including SCF, in vitiliginous keratinocytes, which could result from keratinocyte apoptosis, might be responsible for passive melanocyte death and may explain the Koebner phenomenon. Deprivation of survival factors causes the apoptosis of melanocytes. Vitiligo often develops following physical trauma, even if this is minor. The exact mechanism of the Koebner phenomenon in vitiligo is unclear. First described in 1877 as the appearance of psoriatic lesions in the uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients as a consequence of trauma, the Koebner phenomenon has since been described in numerous diseases.  The Koebner phenomenon is known to occur (lichen sclerosus occurs in skin already scarred or damaged), so trauma, injury, and sexual abuse have been suggested as possible triggers of symptoms in genetically predisposed people.  The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the "deep Koebner" phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis.

The appearance of vitiligo in striae distensae as a form of Koebner phenomenon has been reported rarely. The Koebner phenomenon originally described the appearance of psoriatic lesions in the uninvolved skin of patients with psoriasis as a consequence of trauma. The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the "deep Koebner" phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis To document the role of striae distensae and striae gravidarum in causing Koebner phenomenon in cases of vitiligo, psoriasis and lichen planus.Striae are documented to cause Koebner phenomenon in patients with preexisting vitiligo, psoriasis and lichen planus, the three conditions where true kobenerisation has been suggested according to Boyd and Nelder classification.Striae distensae and striae gravidarum are examples of blunt trauma [Unusual Koebner phenomenon in psoriasis caused by varicella and UVB] A 48 year-old woman developed an exacerbation of a latent psoriasis as a Koebner phenomenon in a migrating erythema caused by Borrelia afzelii infection Intradermal antigen tests and the Koebner phenomenon in psoriasis In addition, intensity of delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resolution times demonstrate no significant difference between psoriatic and nonpsoriatic subjects statistically (P > 0.05).These findings may indicate that intradermal antigens used in this study were more effective in inducing the Koebner phenomenon than injury alone RESULTS: Striae are documented to cause Koebner phenomenon in patients with preexisting vitiligo, psoriasis and lichen planus, the three conditions where 'true kobenerisation' has been suggested according to Boyd and Nelder classification.  According to the presence of Koebner phenomenon they were divided in two groups, one with positive and the other with negative Koebner phenomenon which presented the control group at the same time.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Koebner reaction is often thought to be more frequent in actively spreading, severe psoriasis. We describe a case of concurrent lichen planus and sarcoidosis in the auditory canal, which represents an unusual manifestation of the Koebner phenomenon. According to the presence of Koebner phenomenon they were divided into two groups, 20 patients with positive and 40 patients with negative Koebner reaction, who were the control group at the same time.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 95% of patients treated with PUVA, were cleared of psoriatic changes in the Koebner positive, as well as in the Koebner negative group.

589c42b178275d0c4a00003f	Which are the lipid lowering drugs administered in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)?	Impact of adding ezetimibe to statin to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal (from the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation [COURAGE] trial). After maximizing statin dose, ezetimibe was added to reach the LDL cholesterol goal in 34% of patients (nÂ = 734).  Using Cox regression analysis, the most significant factors associated with achieving LDL cholesterol goals were lower baseline LDL cholesterol, average statin dose, and ezetimibe use. In conclusion, after maximizing statin dose, the addition of ezetimibe results in a substantial increase in the percentage of patients who reach LDL cholesterol goal, a key component of optimal medical therapy. Comparative study of bezafibrate and pravastatin in patients with coronary artery disease and high levels of remnant lipoprotein. Remnant lipoproteinemia is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases. This study examined which of 2 common lipid-lowering drugs (fibrates and statins) is more effective in patients with remnant lipoproteinemia and if lowering remnant lipoprotein levels can reduce CV risk. RLP-C levels at 1 year of treatment were reduced more by bezafibrate than pravastatin (37% and 25% from baseline, respectively).  Bezafibrate therapy decreased RLP-C levels to a greater extent than pravastatin and a decrease in RLP-C level may be associated with a reduction in CV events in patients with high RLP-C levels. Statins are powerful lipid-lowering drugs, widely used in patients with hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease.  Patients are frequently treated with lipid-lowering drugs such as resins, fibrates, niacin, statins and cholesterol absorption-inhibiting drugs (ezetimibe).  This study sought to investigate the effect of daily glucose fluctuation on coronary plaque properties in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) pre-treated with lipid-lowering therapy.There is growing evidence that glucose fluctuation, as a residual risk apart from dyslipidemia, is an important factor contributing to the development of CAD.This prospective study enrolled 70 consecutive CAD patients who were referred for percutaneous coronary intervention and whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was &lt;120 mg/dl under statin treatment or &lt;100 mg/dl without statins To investigate the impact of lipid lowering therapy by different means on skin microvascular function in patients with dysglycaemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).Thirty-six patients were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg daily (S80, n = 19) or ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg daily (E10/S10, n = 17) for 6 weeks Large clinical trials have elucidated that lipid-lowering therapy using statins reduces cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LLT (lipid-lowering therapy) with statins could attenuate EPC telomere erosion in patients with CAD (coronary artery disease) Beneficial effects of pravastatin (+/-colestyramine/niacin) initiated immediately after a coronary event (the randomized Lipid-Coronary Artery Disease [L-CAD] Study).

52bf1f4503868f1b06000016	For the treatment of which conditions can atypical neuroleptic drugs be used?	Further clinical implications are described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations). Intervention strategies are a multimodal psychological programme for the intervention in early prodromal stages and a combination of psychotherapy with atypical neuroleptic drugs in the late prodromal stages.  Atypical neuroleptic drugs have enriched our treatment programs, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. Reviewed here is the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder.  o prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated. The handwriting of 18 schizophrenic patients before and during treatment with typical (haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate) and atypical (clozapine, risperidone) neuroleptic drugs was examined. Atypical and typical neuroleptics, when administered chronically, can bring about profound but contrasting changes in schizophrenic symptoms and motor activation and dramatically modulate brain neurochemistry Recent studies suggest that clozapine is more effective than typical neuroleptics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Acute and late onset movement disorders frequently complicate the treatment of psychosis with typical neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol, but not with atypical neuroleptic drugs like clozapine.  Only the group of boys presented other comorbidities such as negativism and conduct disorders; approximately 25% of them required treatment with atypical neuroleptic drugs. Atypical neuroleptic drugs are the preferred treatment for symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behaviour. Monotherapeutic treatment with new atypical neuroleptic drugs had a more positive effect on the mental health related quality of life (MCS) in comparison to treatment with polypharmacological treatment but not with oral conventional antipsychotics.

533c3af6c45e13371400000d	Which pathological conditions are caused by mutations in the CYLD gene?	We detected a frameshift mutation in the CYLD gene, designated 2253delG, underlying the disorder and were able to show that a single mutation can result in distinct clinical and histologic expression in familial cylindromatosis. Previously, a candidate MTF locus has been mapped to 9p21 while disease gene for familial cylindromatosis, the CYLD gene located on 16q21-13 has been identified Here, we show that mutations in the CYLD gene are also the genetic basis for three different Chinese families with MFT familial trichoepithelioma (MFT) and familial cylindromatosis are two clinically distinct cancer syndromes. MFT patients developed mostly trichoepithelioma in the face while cylindromatosis patients developed cylindromas predominantly (approximately 90%) on the head and neck phenotype of familial cylindromatosis associated with an R758X nonsense mutation in the CYLD tumour suppressor gene We describe a family with cylindromatosis, in which affected individuals have an inherited R758X nonsense mutation of CYLD YLD mutations underlie Brooke-Spiegler, familial cylindromatosis, and multiple familial trichoepithelioma syndromes We describe a single family with affected members exhibiting either the FC or the MFT phenotypes associated with a mutation in the CYLD gene.  ndividuals with germline mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene CYLD are at high risk of developing disfiguring cutaneous appendageal tumours, the defining tumour being the highly organised cylindroma YLD is a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in the skin appendage tumors cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas.  In addition, we have characterized Maspin downregulation in cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas carrying functional inactivating mutations of CYLD, also providing an evidence of the correlation between impaired CYLD function and Maspin decreased expression in vivo in human tumors Germâline mutation in cylindromatosis (CYLD), a tumor suppressor gene, causes familial cylindromatosis and BrookâSpiegler syndrome atients carrying heterozygous germline truncating mutations in the CYLD gene develop multiple primary hair follicle-related tumours. A highly patterned tumour, termed cylindroma, and a highly disorganized tumour, termed spiradenoma, may both develop in the same patient. ultiple trichoepitheliomas associated with a novel heterozygous mutation in the CYLD gene as an adjunct to the histopathological diagnosis ultiple trichoepitheliomas (TEs), especially in the familial setting, have been associated with germline heterozygous mutations in the CYLD gene We describe a 35-year-old woman with multiple facial TEs, in whom the molecular genetic analysis revealed a novel heterozygous c.1843delT mutation in the CYLD gene This frameshift mutation was also present in a heterozygous state in the TE tumor cells. The demonstration of a novel CYLD mutation was used as an adjunct to the histopathological diagnosis in this case novel germline mutation in the CYLD gene in a Slovak patient with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome This new germline mutation in the CYLD gene of a Slovak patient with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome extends the catalogue of known CYLD germline mutations in this condition Molecular biologic study of the CYLD gene performed from the peripheral blood identified a novel splice site c.2041+1 G>T mutation Patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome have various mutations in the CYLD gene, a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 16q Mutation and loss of heterozygosity of the CYLD gene causes development of cylindromatosis, a benign tumour originating from the skin Our study shows that CYLD expression is dramatically downregulated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common cancer in humans Although some early studies suggested a role for the PTCH gene on chromosome 9q22.3 in the etiopathogenesis of MFT, recent studies of occasional patients with the MFT clinical phenotype identified mutations in the CYLD gene on chromosome 16q12-q13, a gene responsible for BSS Since loss of CYLD expression can be observed in different types of human cancer, it is now well established that CYLD acts as a tumor suppressor gene mutations in CYLD can be identified in patients affected with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, (Familial) Cylindromatosis or multiple familial trichoepithelioma we demonstrate that the expression in tumorigenic epidermal cells of a catalytically inactive form of CYLD (CYLD(C/S)) that mimics the identified mutations of cyld in human tumors and competes with the endogenous CYLD results in enhanced cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosi In contrast with previous studies showing the development of benign tumors by mutations in the CYLD gene, here we provide evidence that the occurrence of mutations in the CYLD gene in tumorigenic epidermal cells (carrying previous mutations) increases the aggressiveness of carcinomas, mainly through enhancement of the expression of angiogenic factors, having therefore a key role in epidermal cancer malignancy By interphase cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating decreased CYLD

56c344abfedd0b786b000003	What are the properties of super-enhancers?	Here we report that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified by global nuclear run-on sequencing are extensively transcribed within super enhancers and are dynamically regulated in response to cellular signaling. Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers. The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization.  Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation. Here we review evidence for super-enhancer involvement in cancers, complex diseases, and developmental disorders and discuss interactions between super-enhancers and cofactors/chromatin regulators. The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification. Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers (SEs) drive expression of genes that play prominent roles in normal and disease cells, but the functional importance of these clustered enhancer elements is poorly understood, so it is not clear why genes key to cell identity have evolved regulation by such elements Super-enhancers thus provide a platform for signaling pathways to regulate genes that control cell identity during development and tumorigenesis. Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancersÂ constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin. We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation Super-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity. Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed.  Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation. Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs. NF-ÎºB directs dynamic super enhancer formation in inflammation and atherogenesis. Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.

56ae40110a360a5e45000009	Which computational frameworks are available for predicting enhancers?	In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2% accuracy and 90% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1% and accuracy of 89.64%. Our novel PRISM (predicting regulatory information from single motifs) approach obtains 2543 TF function predictions in a large variety of contexts, at a false discovery rate of 16%. The predictions are highly enriched for validated TF roles, and 45 of 67 (67%) tested binding site regions in five different contexts act as enhancers in functionally matched cells.

5e49c88c6d0a277941000013	List the members of a network of noncoding regulatory RNAs that play a role in the mammalian brain	Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles. Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs-a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs-using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.	[['long ncRNA Cyrano'], ['miR-7 miRNA'], ['Cdr1as circular RNA'], ['miR-671 miRNA']]

We compared the performance of DockRank with several state-of-the-art docking scoring functions using Success Rate (the percentage of cases that have at least one near-native conformation among the top m conformations) and Hit Rate (the percentage of near-native conformations that are included among the top m conformations).  In this study, we developed a novel scoring program, HotLig, which applies the Connolly surface of a protein to calculate hydrophobic interaction and paired pharmacophore interactions with ligands. In addition to molecular surface distance, ligand-contacting areas and hydrogen-bond angles were also introduced to the scoring functions in HotLig a method called residue contact frequency (RCF), which uses the complex structures generated by the protein-protein docking algorithm ZDOCK to predict interface residues devoted to results obtained by the docking program SOL and the post-processing program DISCORE at the CSAR benchmark.

Four possible binding pockets (Pocket A, B, C, and D) at the stalk region of hemagglutinin were detected and defined using the CAVITY program Within this context, low-resolution shape data obtained from either ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) or SAXS experiments have been integrated into the conventional scoring function of the information-driven docking program HADDOCK a novel de novo design program, called LiGen, we developed a docking program, LiGenDock, based on pharmacophore models of binding sites, including a non-enumerative docking algorithm. we present the functionalities of LiGenDock and its accompanying module LiGenPocket, aimed at the binding site analysis and structure-based pharmacophore definition Here we describe the application of the program AutoDock to the design of a focused library that was used in the "click chemistry in-situ" generation of the most potent noncovalent inhibitor of the native enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) yet developed (K(d) = ~100 fM).   the method yields improved success over the standard DOCK energy function for pose identification across a large test set of experimental co-crystal structures, for crossdocking, and for database enrichment The pose prediction success rate of each docking program alone was found in this trial to be 55% for Autodock, 58% for DOCK, and 64% for Vina.

5e493bc06d0a277941000003	List types of cancer where Long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA p53-induced transcript (LINC-PINT) is involved	A peptide encoded by circular form of LINC-PINT suppresses oncogenic transcriptional elongation in glioblastoma. We identify an 87-amino-acid peptide encoded by the circular form of the long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA p53-induced transcript (LINC-PINT) that suppresses glioblastoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. This peptide directly interacts with polymerase associated factor complex (PAF1c) and inhibits the transcriptional elongation of multiple oncogenes. The expression of this peptide and its corresponding circRNA are decreased in glioblastoma compared with the levels in normal tissues. Our results establish the existence of peptides encoded by circRNAs and demonstrate their potential functions in glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and polygenic disease that can be divided into different molecular subtypes based on histological and genomic features. To date, numerous susceptibility loci of breast cancer have been discovered by genome-wide association studies and may expand the genetic features. However, few loci have been further studied according to molecular subtypes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 23 recently discovered single nucleotide polymorphisms using the Sequenom iPLEX platform in a female Chinese cohort of 3,036 breast cancer patients (2,935 samples matched molecular subtypes) and 3,036 healthy controls.RESULTS: Through a stratification analysis, 5q11.2/MAP3K1 (rs16886034, rs16886364, rs16886397, rs1017226, rs16886448) and 7q32.3/LINC-PINT (rs4593472) were associated with Luminal A, and 10q26.1/FGFR2 (rs35054928) was associated with Luminal B. Plasma and tumor levels of Linc-pint are diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, p53 induced transcript (Linc-pint) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates tumor cell viability and proliferation. We used qRT-PCR and RNA FISH analysis to evaluate Linc-pint levels in the plasma and tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer (PCa) patients. Our data demonstrate that Linc-pint expression is lower in plasma samples from PCa patients than from healthy individuals, and indicate that plasma Linc-pint levels are more sensitive than CA19-9 for detecting PCa. Our data also show that Linc-pint levels are lower in PCa tumors than in adjacent tissues, carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (CAV) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and suggest that Linc-pint could be used for distinguishing the cause of malignant obstructive jaundice. Low plasma Linc-pint levels correlate with tumor recurrence, while low tumor Linc-pint levels correlate with poor prognosis for PCa patients after pancreatectomy. These results thus indicate that low plasma Linc-pint expression could serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PCa detection, and that low Linc-pint levels in PCa tumors could be used for predicting patient prognosis.

58a6c94860087bc10a00002a	Which histone mutations have been associated with pediatric gliomas?	Detecting the H3F3A mutant allele found in high-grade pediatric glioma by real-time PCR  It has been reported recently that about 80% of DIPG cases and 70% of midline glioblastomas contain a mutation at one allele of the H3F3A gene (encoding histone H3 variant H3.3), replacing the lysine 27 with methionine (K27M). In order to facilitate diagnosis of DIPG patients, a quick and reliable method to identify the H3F3A K27M mutation is needed. Using this optimized real-time PCR assay, we analyzed eleven samples, two of which containing H3F3A K27M mutation, and found that these two samples were differentially amplified from the nine others.  we were able to discern the H3F3A K27M mutation in a newly obtained pediatric brainstem glioblastoma sample whose H3.3 status was not known previously, and in three other DIPG samples as well as paraffin embedded samples. These results demonstrate that we have developed a new reliable procedure for detecting the H3F3A K27M mutation in pediatric glioblastoma patient samples. Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome and was shown to influence EZH2 function A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo? Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1) Genome-wide studies using ChIP-seq on H3.3K27M patient samples indicate a global reduction of H3K27me3 on chromatin. Remarkably, we also found a dramatic enrichment of H3K27me3 and EZH2 (the catalytic subunit H3K27 methyltransferase) at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells Two new studies show that the known histone H3 alteration p.Lys27Met in pediatric glioma leads to globally diminished trimethylation at histone H3 lysine 27.  The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression. Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. These results indicate that H3.3K27M mutation reprograms epigenetic landscape and gene expression, which may drive tumorigenesis. Here, we discuss vaccine treatment for children diagnosed with malignant glioma, through targeting EphA2, IL-13RÎ±2 and/or histone H3 K27M, while in adults, treatments with RINTEGA, Prophage Series G-100 and dendritic cells are explored. Histone H3 lysine(27)-to-methionine (H3K27M) gain-of-function mutations occur in highly aggressive pediatric gliomas. Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1 (HIST3H1B). Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78Â % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36Â % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.

Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases.  We established a Drosophila animal model for the pathogenic histone H3K27M mutation and show that its overexpression resembles polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) loss-of-function phenotypes, causing derepression of PRC2 target genes and developmental perturbations.  Recent sequencing studies have shown that ~30Â % of pediatric GBM and ~80Â % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas show K27M mutations in the H3F3A gene, a variant encoding histone H3.3. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M--including H3.2K27M--mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome and was shown to influence EZH2 function.The present study investigated the correlation of expression of EZH2 and other PRC2 genes (EZH1, SUZ12, EED) with overall survival of pediatric GBM patients and the cytotoxic impact of EZH2 inhibition by the novel agent Tazemetostat in pediatric GBM/DIPG cells harboring either a H3.3 mutation or a H3 wildtype.EZH2 gene expression does not c Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78Â % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36Â % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Important insights have also been uncovered in the field of pediatric glioma, including the identification of recurrent mutation, fusion, and/or duplication events of the BRAF, FGFR1, MYB, and MYBL1 genes in pediatric low-grade gliomas, mutations affecting histone components (H3F3A p.K27M or p.G34) in pediatric high-grade gliomas, and aggressive subsets developing in midline central nervous system structures. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Taken together, our results suggest that mutations disrupting the histone code at H3K36, including H3.3 G34R/V, IDH1 and/or SETD2 mutations, are central to the genesis of hemispheric HGGs in older children and young adults. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Moreover, the gain of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 at gene promoters alters the expression of genes that are associated with various cancer pathways.

52fa73e82059c6d71c000059	List the existing methods for genetic manipulation of cells.	For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully. However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing. To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.  Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis. As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes. Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli. Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization. Here, we describe a vector system for efficient multigene assembly and transformation. The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors. By exploiting the CreloxP recombination system and homing endonucleases, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycling were carried out with alternate use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector.

However, they face acute challenges from a data reproducibility standpoint, in that no two independent studies have been found to produce the same proteomic patterns. Such reproducibility issues cause the identified biomarker patterns to lose repeatability and prevent real clinical usage.

52fb78d82059c6d71c000068	Which mutations of SCN5A gene are implicated in Brugada syndrome?	This was the first study to systematically investigate sodium channel variants in Chinese patients with ARVD; a new SCN5A mutation, I137M, was found.  We describe a family showing the association between Brugada syndrome and epilepsy in which a known mutation in the SCN5A gene (p.W1095X, c.3284G>A) was identified.  Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a life-threatening arrhythmia disorder associated with autosomal-dominant mutations in the SCN5A gene. We aimed to characterize the diagnostic challenges and clinical manifestations of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with BrS. RESULTS: From a novel SCN5A mutation (c.664C>T; p.Arg222X) identified in a proband with the characteristic electrocardiographic pattern and the history of sudden collapse, 122 family members were studied including 40 carriers of the mutation.  We analyzed the sequence of this gene in 25 Spanish patients with Brugada syndrome. In 4 (16%), we found mutations that had not previously been described: three were amino acid changes (i.e. Ala2>Thr, Ala735>Thr and Val1340>Ile) and one was an intron mutation that affected messenger RNA processing (i.e. IVS18-1G>A). The 4 most frequent BrS1-associated mutations were E1784K (14x), F861WfsX90 (11x), D356N (8x), and G1408R (7x). One missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region among the cohort of 19 patients. A H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele.  Thus, we studied the functional restoration of nonsense-mutated SCN5A. RESULTS: HEK293 cells were transfected with SCN5A cDNA or its mutant carrying W822X, a nonsense mutation associated with Brugada syndrome and sudden cardiac death.  Among the cohort of 19 patients, one missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region. An H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele. Novel SCN5A mutation (Q55X) associated with age-dependent expression of Brugada syndrome presenting as neurally mediated syncope. A novel nonsense SCN5A mutation (Q55X) was identified in the proband, his mother, and his asymptomatic brother. Novel SCN5A gene mutations associated with Brugada syndrome: V95I, A1649V and delF1617 An intronic mutation (c.4810+3_4810+6dupGGGT) in the SCN5A gene, located outside the consensus splice site, was detected in this study in a family with a highly variable clinical phenotype of Brugada syndrome and/or conduction disease and in a patient with Brugada syndrome. We genetically screened 30 asymptomatic probands (29 men and 1 woman; mean age 47.1 years) exhibiting a spontaneous Brugada-type ECG. Family members of patients with Brugada syndrome were excluded from the study.  Genetic screening failed to identify SCN5A mutations in most cases but demonstrated a novel double missense mutation (K1527R and A1569P) located on the same allele in another asymptomatic subject (case 2). We screened patients with SUNDS for mutations in SCN5A, the gene known to cause Brugada syndrome, as well as genes encoding ion channels associated with the long-QT syndrome. One mutation, R367H, lies in the first P segment of the pore-lining region between the DIS5 and DIS6 transmembrane segments of SCN5A. A second mutation, A735V, lies in the first transmembrane segment of domain II (DIIS1) close to the first extracellular loop between DIIS1 and DIIS2, whereas the third mutation, R1192Q, lies in domain III. The substitution (D1790G) causes LQTS and the insertion (D1795) induces both LQTS and Brugada syndromes in carrier patients.

The macroscopic and microscopic findings of a case of Zieve's syndrome are described (fatty liver, icterus, hyperlipemia and hemolytic anemia in chronic alcoholism).  Reversible haemolytic anaemia associated with decreased red cell half-life and reticulocytosis was studied in 10 patients with Zieve's syndrome.  The Zieve's syndrome consists of the transient association of cholestatic jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hyperlipemia, in a chronic alcoholic.  Laboratory findings revealed Zieve-syndrome (alcoholic hyperlipemia, hemolytic anemia, and alcoholic fatty liver) and negative Hounsfield Unit measurement of the hypodense rim finally identified it as a layer of fat around the clot. The Zieve syndrome is characterized by hemolytic anemia in conjunction with secondary hyperlipidemia in patients suffering from alcohol-related toxic liver damage. Zieve's syndrome, characterized by jaundice, hyperlipaemia and haemolytic anaemia, usually develops in young, chronically alcoholic subjects with enlarged fatty liver. The Zieve's syndrome consists of the transient association of cholestatic jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hyperlipemia, in a chronic alcoholic. We report a case of recurrent Zieve's syndrome, consisting of jaundice, hemolytic anemia and hyperlipoproteinemia, initiated by alcohol abuse. The macroscopic and microscopic findings of a case of Zieve's syndrome are described (fatty liver, icterus, hyperlipemia and hemolytic anemia in chronic alcoholism).

571653aecb4ef8864c000005	Which are the most common methods for ctDNA (circulating tumour DNA) detection?	existing methods for ctDNA detection are restricted to genetic mutations. Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform. The practice of "liquid biopsy" as a diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic tool in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is an appealing approach, at least in theory, since it is noninvasive and easily repeated Here we introduce cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA.  Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq. We envision that CAPP-Seq could be routinely applied clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies, thus facilitating personalized cancer therapy. Synthesis of a new Ni-phenanthroline complex and its application as an electrochemical probe for detection of nucleic acid A new DNA sensor using a nickel(II) phenanthroline complex ([Ni(phen)(2)PHPIP]Â·2ClO(4)) as the electrochemical probe was developed. The sensor is very sensitive and selective for calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) detection in aqueous medium.

In Escherichia coli, initial assembly of the Z ring for cell division requires FtsZ plus the essential Z ring-associated proteins FtsA and ZipA. FtsZ is an essential cell division protein in Escherichia coli, and its localization, filamentation, and bundling at the mid-cell are required for Z-ring stability. the bacterial division FtsZ protein The GTPase-dependent polymerization/depolymerization dynamics of FtsZ regulate bacterial cell division in vivo.  Bacterial cytokinesis depends upon the tubulin-like GTPase FtsZ, which polymerizes into an annular structure at midcell (the Z-ring) that defines the division site. FtsZ is the first of the divisome proteins to accumulate at the division site and is widely thought to function as a force generator that constricts the cell envelope.  the cell division protein FtsZ FtsZ, the key protein of bacterial cell division was selected as a potent anti bacterial target.  the cell-division protein FtsZ  FtsZ and PG together function in orchestrating cell division and maintaining cell shape in almost all other bacteria.  the tubulin-like protein of the division septum FtsZ FtsZ is a widely distributed major cytoskeletal protein involved in the archaea and bacteria cell division.  Four major roles of FtsZ have been characterized: cell elongation, GTPase, cell division, and bacterial cytoskeleton.  Bacterial cell division involves a complex and dynamic sequence of events whereby polymers of the protein FtsZ assemble at the division plane and rearrange to achieve the goal of contracting the cell membrane at the site of cell division, thus dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells.  the cell division protein FtsZ FtsZ, the homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is a GTPase that assembles into cytokinetic Z rings essential for cell division in prokaryotic cells	[['cell elongation'], ['GTPase'], ['cell division'], ['bacterial cytoskeleton']]
589a246178275d0c4a00002b	Which two drugs were compared in the ARISTOTLE Trial?	METHODS: We analyzed patients from ARISTOTLE, a randomized trial of 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation comparing the effects of apixaban versus warfarin on the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.   In this study we evaluated the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers at baseline and future risk of cardiovascular events in the Apixaban for Reduction In Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial.METHODS: The ARISTOTLE trial randomised 18,201 patients with AF to apixaban or warfarin. Moreover, apixaban was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99) although this finding was driven by the results of the ARISTOTLE trial. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF.  METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin, based on data from the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in AF (ARISTOTLE) trial.  The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban.

A comparative analysis of three major clinical trials with factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant (XOAC) drugs versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation-Rocket-AF (rivaroxaban), Aristotle (apixaban) and Engage AF Timi 48 (edoxaban; two different doses and sets of data)-was carried out.Data were extracted from the original reports (study level) and a meta-analysis was carried out.When compared with warfarin, XOAC therapy was associated with a decrease in haemorrhagic stroke, with a similar pattern for all regimens and meta-analysis showing a risk ratio of 0.488 (95% C This study sought to characterize major bleeding on the basis of the components of the major bleeding definition, to explore major bleeding by location, to define 30-day mortality after a major bleeding event, and to identify factors associated with major bleeding.Apixaban was shown to reduce the risk of major hemorrhage among patients with atrial fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial.All patients who received at least 1 dose of a study drug were included. Little is known about patients with 1 dose-reduction criterion who received the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban.To determine the frequency of 1 dose-reduction criterion and whether the effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients with 1 or no dose-reduction criteria.Among 18 201 patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, 17â¯322 were included in this analysis. We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of the 3 new agents based on data from their published warfarin-controlled randomized trials, using the method of adjusted indirect comparisons.We included findings from 44 535 patients enrolled in 3 trials of the efficacy of dabigatran (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy [RELY]), apixaban (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]), and rivaroxaban (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial i This study aimed to evaluate the medical cost reductions associated with the use of individual NOACs instead of warfarin from the US payer perspective.Rates for efficacy and safety clinical events for warfarin were estimated as the weighted averages from the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE trials, and event rates for NOACs were determined by applying trial hazard ratios or relative risk ratios to such weighted averages. The ARISTOTLE trial showed apixaban was superior to warfarin for stroke prevention, significantly reduced all major bleeding, and resulted in a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, with a similar reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke and better tolerability. The results of the ARISTOTLE trial, which is evaluating apixaban against warfarin in â¼18â000 patients with AF, are expected to be available later this year. The Medco data did not contain information for patients receiving apixaban as it was not on the market at the time of analysis.RESULTS: Stroke and MB rates among RW NVAF patients during warfarin exposure were higher compared with event rates in patients treated with warfarin in ARISTOTLE (stroke: 5.29 vs. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban when compared with warfarin reduced the rate of stroke, death, and bleeding. The ARISTOTLE trial compared apixaban with warfarin in 18 201 patients with AF and â¥ 1 additional risk factor for stroke. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF.

58de71fa8acda3452900002c	Which proteins remove H2A.Z in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae?	Removal of H2A.Z by INO80 promotes homologous recombination Budding yeast INO80 can remove H2A.Z/H2B dimers from chromatin and replace them with H2A/H2B dimers. Here, we show that H2A.Z in human cells is indeed rapidly removed from chromatin flanking DNA damage by INO80. We also report that the histone chaperone ANP32E, which is implicated in removing H2AZ from chromatin, similarly promotes HR and appears to work on the same pathway as INO80 in these assays. H2A.Z removal from chromatin is the primary function of INO80 and ANP32E in promoting homologous recombination. Instead, the INO80 complex, which removes H2A.Z(Htz1) from nucleosomes, promotes the ectopic deposition of CENP-A(Cse4).	[['INO80'], ['ANP32E']]
5166f41a298dcd4e5100005b	Which are the inhibitors of histone methyltransferases?	However, in general, HMTs have no widely accepted high-throughput screening (HTS) assay format, and reference inhibitors are not available for many of the enzymes. Small-molecule histone methyltransferase inhibitors display rapid antimalarial activity against all blood stage forms in Plasmodium falciparum. We synthesized a compound library based upon a known specific inhibitor (BIX-01294) of the human G9a histone methyltransferase. Two compounds, BIX-01294 and its derivative TM2-115, inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 parasites in culture with IC(50) values of ~100 nM, values at least 22-fold more potent than their apparent IC(50) toward two human cell lines and one mouse cell line. Together, these results suggest that BIX-01294 and TM2-115 inhibit malaria parasite histone methyltransferases, resulting in rapid and irreversible parasite death. Synthesis and structure-activity relationship investigation of adenosine-containing inhibitors of histone methyltransferase DOT1L. A total of 55 adenosine-containing compounds were designed and synthesized, among which several potent DOT1L inhibitors were identified with K(i) values as low as 0.5 nM. Several new reagents and assays were developed to aid in the identification of EZH2 inhibitors, and these were used to execute two high-throughput screening campaigns. Of the five histone methyltransferases known to mediate methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9), euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2; also known as G9a) has been shown to be a primary mediator of H3K9 dimethylation; BIX-01294 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of EHMT2 We hypothesised that inhibition of EHMT2 by BIX-01294 would result in reduced levels of H3K9 dimethylation and compromised embryo development. We also demonstrate that peptides that mimic SET1 family Win motif sequences inhibit H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex with varying degrees of efficiency. Studies of H3K4me3 demethylation by KDM5B/Jarid1B/PLU1 reveals strong substrate recognition in vitro and identifies 2,4-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid as an in vitro and in cell inhibitor. Inhibition studies of ccKDM5B showed both in vitro and in cell inhibition of ccKDM5B by 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) with a potency similar to that reported for the HDM KDM4C. Treatment with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an inhibitor of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, significantly enhanced the BZLF1 transcription in Raji cells when in combination with an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). All assays allowed profiling of known SET7/9 and LSD1 inhibitors. The results demonstrate that the optimized LANCE Ultra and AlphaLISA assay formats provide a relevant biochemical screening approach toward the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of HMTs and HDMs that could lead to novel epigenetic therapies. Selective inhibitors of histone methyltransferase DOT1L: design, synthesis, and crystallographic studies. We used structure- and mechanism-based design to discover several potent inhibitors of DOT1L with IC(50) values as low as 38 nM. Inhibition of histone lysine methylation enhances cancer-testis antigen expression in lung cancer cells: implications for adoptive immunotherapy of cancer. Short hairpin RNAs were used to inhibit several histone methyltransferases (KMT) and histone demethylases (KDM) that mediate histone methylation and repress gene expression. DZNep, a pharmacologic inhibitor of KMT6 expression, recapitulated the effects of KMT6 knockdown. Recent evidence shows that S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors (AHI) such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) modulate chromatin through indirect inhibition of histone methyltransferases including EZH2. We investigated the biological effects of AdoHcy hydrolase inhibition using DZNep and its structural analogues 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) and neplanocin A (Nep A) in breast cancer cells. A chemiluminescence-based method for identification of histone lysine methyltransferase inhibitors. The method is particularly well suited for detection of inhibitors acting by the desired histone peptide competitive mechanism and is applicable to testing other HMTs, demonstrated here with the G9a homolog EHMT1, also known as GLP. This study reports the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of a novel histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, psammaplin A (PsA), in mice. Human diet contains many histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as the bioactive component sulforaphane (SFN), whose epigenetic effects on MSTN gene in satellite cells are unknown. We found that DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) reduced leptin receptor expression. However, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBt) significantly increased Wnt5a mRNA expression in SW620.

515da6e2298dcd4e51000010	What is the treatment of neuropathic pain in children?	Oxcarbazepine, a metabolite of carbamazepine, is used as an antiepileptic, analgesic for neuropathic pain and in the treatment of affective disorders. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for partial seizures in adults as both adjunctive and monotherapy, and as adjunctive therapy in children aged from 2 to 16 years For difficult to treat neuropathic pain from cancer, adjuvant analgesics are often used with opioids Ketamine and lidocaine can be safely infused together with concomitant opioids for the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain caused by cancer. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years. In neuropathic pain or phantom pain coanalgetics should be used to effectively treat pain in young patients. Pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It is also indicated as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of epilepsy and for generalized anxiety disorder. Pregabalin is a GABA analogue Treatment was typically initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, and 5 of the 6 girls noted improvement in their symptoms, including 2 who had marked improvement, and another 3 with substantial improvement who were able to discontinue therapy without a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Vulvodynia does occur among young girls and, when treated as a neuropathic pain disorder, was found to dramatically improve or remit in the majority of those treated in this small case series. We describe a case series of five adolescents who were managed with lidocaine 5% patches for chronic localized neuropathic pain from a variety of causes with minimal adverse effects. Treatment was effective in four of five patients with only one patient complaining of minimal pain relief Twenty-two children or 14% of children on opioid therapy underwent 30 opioid rotations. Mucositis was the cause of pain in 19 (70%) children, bone pain in 3 (11%) children, and postoperative, visceral, or neuropathic pain in the remainder. The opioid was rotated either for excessive side effects with adequate analgesia (70%), excessive side effects with inadequate analgesia (16.7%), or tolerance (6.7%). Five (23%) children required two rotations, 3 during the same admission. The favored rotations were morphine to fentanyl in 20 (67%) children and fentanyl to hydromorphone in 6 (20%). Adverse opioid effects were resolved in 90% of cases, all failures occurred when morphine was rotated to fentanyl. To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic pain Dying children with cancer and neuropathic pain have higher baseline requirements of morphine and benzodiazepines and require rapid increases of both drugs in the last 72 hours of life than dying children without neuropathic pain. ketamine treatment may be effective in children with severe neuropathic pain not responsive to other analgesics. This patient also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term ketamine treatment in pediatric oncology and that such treatment can be administered in a home care setting. Oral amitriptyline has been used as an analgesic in a wide range of pain settings. Despite long-term availability of a parenteral form, the few reports about this formulation have been limited to pharmacokinetic studies in normal volunteers, trials in depressed patients, and analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) activation. We retrospectively reviewed our experience using intravenous (IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at Stanford. Eight children (aged 5-16.6 years), who were unable to tolerate medications by the oral route, received IV amitriptyline for a variety of indications, including neuropathic pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and as an adjuvant agent for opioid analgesia.

589c4c9078275d0c4a000040	What are the side effects during statins administration in patients with atherosclerosis?	A history of side effects was reported by 40 (19.5%) of the patients, and mainly consisted of muscle complaints and gastrointestinal symptoms.  Treatment Options for Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms. Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment. At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).  Muscle problems and other adverse symptoms associated with statin use are frequent reasons for non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy, which results in inadequate control of hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk.  It was estimated that rosuvastatin-associated absolute hazards of muscle-, liver- and renal-related adverse effects are lower than the corresponding vascular benefits in moderate vascular risk individuals.  Rosuvastatin-induced proteinuria appears to be of tubular origin, not relating to kidney injury. Rosuvastatin increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by dose-dependently impairing insulin sensitivity.  Statins are associated with myopathy, transaminase elevations, and an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus among some patients; connections between statins and other processes, such as renal and neurologic function, have also been studied with mixed results.  Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment.This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search, and on the current recommendations of the European Atherosclerosis Society.At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Nevertheless, patients may develop side effects such as muscle pain and weakness years after starting statin therapy; however, the absolute number of patients affected by statin myopathy increases with treatment duration. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in statin-induced myopathy may help identify patient groups susceptible to statins' side effects, thereby increasing their safety..

RIT may be a safe and useful method of AIT therapy in patients with low RAIU, in whom other treatment methods are contraindicated. Treatment consists in the use of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs and steroids in an isolated form or in combination. the addition of lithium carbonate to the two other drugs resulted in a successful and safety therapy in controlling amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. lithium is a useful and safe medication for treatment of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis caused by amiodarone. Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping amiodarone treatment. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT).	[['Antithyroid drugs'], ['Corticosteroids'], ['Lithium'], ['Radioiodine']]

MutY and MutSL (mismatch repair system [MMR]) Escherichia coli DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein MutS  We have characterized the mismatch repair system (MMR) of the highly radiation-resistant type strain of Deinococcus radiodurans, ATCC 13939. We show that the MMR system is functional in this organism, where it participates in ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and recombination. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. the mutS/L operon essential for methyldirected mismatch repair (MMR) activity The mismatch repair system (mutS, mutL and uvrD genes) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa The mismatch repair system (MMR) recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases caused mainly by DNA polymerase, and contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication in living cells. In Escherichia coli, the MutHLS system is known to function in MMR, and homologues of MutS and MutL are widely conserved in almost all organisms. A simple genetic system has been developed to test the effect of over-expression of wild-type or mutated human MutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) proteins on methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) in Escherichia coli. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria. The methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo, but one of the difficulties in determining the biological relationships between the MMR-related proteins is the tendency of MutL to self-aggregate. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. MutL is required to assist the mismatch repair protein MutS during initiation of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) response in various organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Moreover, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) is known to trigger sensitivity to methylating agents via a mechanism that involves recognition by MutS of the O(6)-mG:T replication intermediates. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. In Escherichia coli, the best studied mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is the methyl-directed long patch repair system which is mediated by three gene products; MutS, MutL and MutH. Cells devoid of MutS1 or MutL proteins were as resistant to gamma-rays, mitomycin C and UV-irradiation as wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the mismatch repair system is not essential for the reconstitution of a functional genome after DNA damage. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition	[['mutS'], ['mutL'], ['mutH']]
56f24fec2ac5ed1459000015	Which RNA polymerase is used for the replication of viroids?	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II of plant origin transcribes viroid RNA into full-length copies DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II purified from healthy plant tissue is capable of synthesizing linear (-)-viroid RNA copies of full length from (+)-viroid RNA templates in vitro. Viroid RNA is accepted as a template for in vitro transcription by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli The RNA genome of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) is transcribed in vitro into complementary DNA and RNA by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase, respectively, from Escherichia coli. In vitro transcription of viroid RNA into full-length copies by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato leaf tissue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato plant tissue accepts potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) RNA as a template for the in vitro synthesis of full-length RNA copies of the PSTV genome Whereas maximum total activity was observed in 1 mM Mn(2+) with a pronounced reduction (80%) in 5 mM Mn(2+), CEV synthesis was maintained in 1-15 mM Mn(2+). Inhibition of alpha-amanitin-sensitive CEV synthesis in 200 mM (NH(4))(2)SO(4) resembles the reaction of RNA polymerase II on a free nucleic acid template Citrus exocortis viroid RNA is associated with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II in tomato in vivo. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV. Transcription of potato spindle tuber viroid by RNA polymerase II starts predominantly at two specific sites Pospiviroidae, with their main representative potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), are replicated via a rolling circle mechanism by the host-encoded DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (pol II) Transcription of potato spindle tuber viroid by RNA polymerase II starts in the left terminal loop Viroids of the family Pospiviroidae, of which potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is the type strain, are replicated by the host's DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II in the nucleus. Tomato RNA polymerase II interacts with the rod-like conformation of the left terminal domain of the potato spindle tuber viroid positive RNA genome Host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) was proposed to be critical for its replication, but no interaction site for RNAP II on the PSTVd RNA genome was identified.  RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined. Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined Viroids of the family Pospiviroidae, of which potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is the type strain, are replicated by the host&apos;s DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II in the nucleus Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II.  These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved.  Inhibition studies with alpha-amanitin showed that the synthesis of ASBV-specific RNAs was not affected by concentrations of 1 and 200 micrograms/ml of the drug, which typically inhibit RNA polymerase II and III, respectively, from most animal and plant systems. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved. Nucleoprotein complexes in the soluble fraction which bound to a monoclonal antibody to the carboxy terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (8WG16) were affinity purified and contained plus- and minus-sense CEV RNA.

515db20e298dcd4e51000014	What are the current treatments for generalised anxiety disorder in teenagers?	49.3% of the youths with depression had comorbid conditions: anxiety disorders in 23.37% of cases To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a school-based group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders with African-American adolescents. METHODS: Twelve adolescents (mean age = 15.6 years) with anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 6) or a group attention-support control condition At posttreatment and among those who attended more than one treatment session, 3/4 adolescents in CBT no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder, compared with 1/5 in AS-Control. Clinician ratings of impairment and self-report levels of overall anxiety were significantly lower at posttreatment in CBT compared with AS-Control The present study compares an individual versus a group format in the delivery of manualised cognitive-behavioural therapy (FRIENDS) for children with anxiety disorders. Clinically referred children (aged 8 to 12) diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder (n = 52), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (n = 37), Social Phobia (n = 22) or Specific Phobia (n = 16) were randomly assigned to individual (n = 65) or group (n = 62) treatment. Forty-eight percent of the children in the individual versus 41% in the group treatment were free of any anxiety disorder at post-treatment; 62% versus 54% were free of their primary anxiety disorder. Regression analyses showed no significant difference in outcome between individual and group treatment Children improved in both conditions. Choice between treatments could be based on pragmatic considerations such as therapeutic resources, referral rates, and the preference of the parents and the child. All child anxiety disorders were associated with several forms of anxiety disorder in the mother. Some specificity in the form of anxiety disorder in the child and the mother was apparent for social phobia and separation anxiety disorder. The findings have implications for the management of child anxiety.

Human disc-large homolog (hDlg), also known as synapse-associated protein 97, is a scaffold protein, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, implicated in neuronal synapses and epithelial-epithelial cell junctions whose expression and function remains poorly characterized in most tissues, particularly in the vasculature.  Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human aorta cDNA library, we identified mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)2, a member of the ERK cascade, as an hDlg binding partner. Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses. Here, we show that two scaffold proteins, caveolin-1 and IQGAP1, are required for phosphorylation of the actin associated pool of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in response to protein kinase C activation. ERK activation is enhanced by the scaffolding proteins KSR and MP1, localized near the cell membrane and late endosomes respectively, but little is known about their dynamic interplay.  Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells. These scaffolds include KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), beta-arrestin, MEK partner-1, Sef and IQGAP1. Here we analyze a potential scaffold of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), by generating KSR-deficient mice.  This demonstrates that KSR is a bona fide scaffold that is not required for but enhances signaling via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. We reported previously that several 14-3-3 isotypes bind to protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta and facilitate coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 [van der Hoeven, van der Wal, Ruurs, van Dijk and van Blitterswijk (2000) Biochem. J. 345, 297-306], an event that boosts the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) pathway in Rat-1 fibroblasts.  In this study, IQGAP1 (IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1), a new Nrf2 interaction partner that we have published previously, was found to modulate MEK-ERK-mediated Nrf2 activation and induction of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes. In the aggregate, these results suggest that IQGAP1 may play an important role in the MEK-ERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway.  Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses. The MAP kinase ERK and its scaffold protein MP1 interact with the chromatin regulator Corto during Drosophila wing tissue development. KSR-1 is a scaffold protein that is essential for Ras-induced activation of the highly conserved RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Previously, we identified a close homolog of KSR-1, called KSR-2, through structural homology-based data mining The scaffold protein beta-arrestin2 interacted with both p-ERK and D1 DA receptor, triggering the cytosolic retention of p-ERK and inducing striatal neuronal apoptotic death.  Involvement of the MP1 scaffold protein in ERK signaling regulation during Drosophila wing development. Beta-arrestin mediates desensitization and internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs), but also acts as a scaffold protein in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Recent studies indicate that kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)is a scaffold protein for the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in mammals.  The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates cell signaling through the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade and positively regulates ERK signaling. Our results indicate that KSR-2 may act as a scaffold protein similar as KSR-1 to mediate the MAPK core (RAF-MEK-ERK) signaling but with a distinct RAF isoform specificity, namely KSR-2 may only mediate the A-RAF signaling while KSR-1 is responsible for transducing signals only from c-RAF. Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the core kinase components of the ERK cascade, Raf, MEK, ERK to provide spatial and temporal regulation of Ras-dependent ERK cascade signaling. These findings identify KSR2 as a Ca2+-regulated ERK scaffold and reveal a new mechanism whereby Ca2+ impacts Ras to ERK pathway signaling. MEK Partner-1 (MP1) was identified as a potential "scaffold" protein for the mammalian extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway The scaffold protein MP1 (MEK1 partner) assembles a scaffold complex in the ERK cascade IQGAP1 scaffold-MAP kinase (ERK) interaction was noted in the human myeloma RPMI8226 cell lines. In conclusion, IQGAP1 plays an important role in the cell proliferation of MM via the MAP kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK-regulated, metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin bsence of kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), a scaffold protein of the ERK signaling pathway GAB2 is a scaffold protein with diverse upstream and downstream effectors. MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are known effectors of GAB2. In Drosophila, dMP1, that encodes an ERK scaffold protein, regulates ERK signaling during wing development and contributes to intervein and vein cell differentiation. Scaffold proteins regulate intracellular MAP kinase signaling by providing critical spatial and temporal specificities. We have shown previously that the scaffold protein MEK1 partner (MP1) is localized to late endosomes by the adaptor protein p14. The scaffold protein Shoc2/SUR-8 accelerates the interaction of Ras and Raf. We propose that Shoc2 regulates the spatio-temporal patterns of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway primarily by accelerating the Ras-Raf interaction. Proteomic characterization of the dynamic KSR-2 interactome, a signaling scaffold complex in MAPK pathway. Kinase modules are associated with scaffold proteins that regulate signaling by providing critical spatial and temporal specificities. Some of these scaffold proteins have been shown to be conserved, both in sequence and function. In mouse, the scaffold MP1 (MEK Partner 1) forms a signaling complex with MEK1 and ERK1.   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway scaffold protein MP1.  We propose that MORG1 is a component of a modular scaffold system that participates in the regulation of agonist-specific ERK signaling.  IQGAP1, a scaffold protein linking cadherin-mediated cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton. This effect was accompanied by reduction of N-cadherin/IQGAP1/Erk-2 interactions.

56cdf3745795f9a73e000039	Which are the main components of mTORC1?	Raptor-mTOR and Rictor-mTOR complexes compete for association with LST8, and this mechanism may contribute to the reciprocal negative regulations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, in terms of their LST8 components. The mTOR kinase controls cell growth, proliferation, and survival through two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR and mLST8 are in both complexes, while raptor and rictor are part of only mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). composition of mTORC1 (raptor, mTOR, and GbetaL) The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes, mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and sin1. The mTORC1 protein kinase complex consists of mTOR, raptor, mLST8/GbetaL and PRAS40. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2.

Until now, the role of uc.189 in human cancers remains undefined and the clinical significance of uc.189 in gynecological cancers remains unknown. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in gynecological cancers. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 243 samples including 116 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), 98 endometrial adenocarcinomas (EACs), 29 ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas(OCAs), and corresponding normal tissues. In CSCC, uc.189 expression was increased in 78.5% of cases (91/116), decreased in 4.3% (5/116), and unchanged in 17.2% (20/116). In EAC its expression was increased in 74.5% (73/98), decreased in 3.1% (3/98), and unchanged in 22.4% (22/98). Expression of uc.189 was increased in 23, and unchanged/decreased in 6, of 29 cases of ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas.

This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis.

56f96333cf1c325851000004	What kind of bonds are connecting keratin molecules?	 Feathers and hair consist of cornified epidermal keratinocytes in which proteins are crosslinked via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of structural proteins to establish mechanical resilience.  The method involves the generation of thiols by controlled reduction of cystine disulfide bonds in keratin ossible chemical bonds formed between alpha-keratins and KAbetaPs may derive from electrostatic interactions in addition to cross-linking through disulphide bonds. The method involves the generation of thiols by controlled reduction of cystine disulfide bonds in the keratin e solubility test in the dithiothreitol/urea extraction buffer, the amino acid composition analysis and studies on keratin secondary structures suggest that the improved stability in water of thermally treated mats can be ascribed to the formation of amide bonds between acid and basic groups of some amino acid side chains. s the energy involved in the formation of disulfide bonds is much greater than that of hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions the structural transition is likely to be dominated by the requirement that the bonded cysteine residues occur at closely equivalent axial positions. The interface of the K5-K14 coiled-coil heterodimer has asymmetric salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, and its surface exhibits a notable charge polarization. A trans-dimer homotypic disulfide bond involving Cys367 in K14's stutter region occurs in the crystal and in skin keratinocytes, where it is concentrated in a keratin filament cage enveloping the nucleus.   the alpha helices which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and the alpha-helical coiled coils which are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, is more sensitive to radiation than the supramolecular architecture of the keratin filament and the filament packing within the keratin associated proteins matrix, which is stabilized by disulphide bonds. .

52bf1af803868f1b06000008	Which diseases are caused by mutations in Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene?	Recessively inherited CPVT is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene. It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia.  The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene. In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p.L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT.  These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease. Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT. Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease. We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT. Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p.Y55C (c.164A>G) and p.P308L (c.923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene.  A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT. Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations.  We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles.  The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias. Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT.  Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.  These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT. This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT. An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu). These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population.

52df8ce798d023950500000d	Which are the supplemental antioxidant in athletes?	Although these supplementations are increasingly used by master athletes, very few data are available on their effects on oxidative stress, muscle recovery, and physical performance. The potential benefits of supplement use in athletes are thus questionable. Some studies indicate no benefits, while others highlight potential negative side effects of vitamin supplementation.  These data indicate that RQ significantly reduces exercise-induced lipid peroxidation without associated changes in inflammation or plasma antioxidant status. Cr supplementation inhibited the increase of inflammation markers TNF-Î± and CRP, but not oxidative stress markers, due to acute exercise. Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent. Vitamins C and E supplementation had no significant effect on any of the studied parameters. Effects of the two treatments relative to placebo on mean performance in the incremental test and time trial were unclear, but runners faster by 1 SD of peak speed demonstrated a possible improvement on peak running speed with BC juice (1.9%; Â±2.5%).  Training status correlates more strongly with antioxidant status than diet does Consequently, we can conclude that Biostimine supplementation reduces the postexercise level of TBARS by increasing the antioxidant activity of plasma but has no effect on inflammatory markers. Supplementation with Asx could prevent exercise induced free radical production and depletion of non-enzymatic antioxidant defense in young soccer players. In conclusion these results indicated that treatment with melatonin in acute sports exercise reversed oxidative stress, improved defenses and lipid metabolism, which would result in an improvement in fitness. CoQ(10) supplementation before strenuous exercise decreases the oxidative stress and modulates the inflammatory signaling, reducing the subsequent muscle damage. Heretofore, Cr's positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects. These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE. Nevertheless, based upon the growing evidence that many athletic populations are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, it is recommended that athletes monitor their serum vitamin D concentration and consult with their health care professional and/or nutritionist to determine if they would derive health benefits from vitamin D supplementation. This study examined the effects of 1,000 mg quercetin + 1,000 mg vitamin C (QC); 1,000 mg quercetin, 1,000 mg vitamin C, 400 mg isoquercetin, 30 mg epigallocatechin gallate, and 400 mg n-3 fatty acids (QFO) The two strains, L. rhamnosus IMC 501(Â®) and L. paracasei IMC 502(Â®), exert strong antioxidant activity. Athletes and all those exposed to oxidative stress may benefit from the ability of these probiotics to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species. These results indicate that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFAs significantly increased oxidative stress at rest and after a judo-training session. Rhodiola Rosea, is an adaptogen plant which has been reported to promote fatty acids utilisation, to ameliorate antioxidant function, and to improve body resistance to physical strenuous efforts.  Supplementation with antioxidant vitamin E to athletes at 267 mg (400 IUs) or greater has been reported to reduce levels of LP associated with exercise. Results obtained at the end of the study indicate that zinc supplementation prevents production of free radicals by activating the antioxidant system. The significant increase in the UI of erythrocyte membranes indicates the potential for harm, because a high intake of PUFA might increase susceptibility to lipid peroxidation not counterbalanced by a higher increase in TAA. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet seems to be the better choice. A number of clinical trials have successfully been performed using whey and/or soy proteins in the treatment of many diseases. They both have antioxidant properties, which appears to be a factor in aerobic physical performance as well.  The antioxidant effect of the two proteins is based on different mechanisms of action.

Transcribed ultraconserved noncoding RNA uc.160 acts as a negative regulator in gastric cancer. uc.160 was found to be a suppressive factor of cancer development, but its role has not been fully elucidated.METHODS: The uc.160 expression was examined in gastric cancer tissues and established cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. PTEN levels were detected by Western blotting. Anti-tumor effects of uc.160 were further explored in tumor transplantation models.RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively. Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, uc.160 positively regulated the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. Interestingly, uc.160 was inhibited by microRNA miR-155 that is also a negative regulator of gastric cancer.CONCLUSION: uc.160 is significantly down-regulated in gastric carcinomas and can inhibit the tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that uc.160 may be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of gastric malignancies. Expression and function of Uc.160+, a transcribed ultraconserved region, in gastric cancer. BACKGROUND: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved among the orthologous regions in most vertebrates. It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC. We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.

The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-12/23 p40 antibody, and guselkumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-23 antibody, were evaluated in adults with active RA despite methotrexate (MTX) therapy. The purpose of this review is to update the reader on treatment options for PsA using conventional synthetic disease modifying agents (csDMARDs) and novel therapies including tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, interleukin 12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab), the interleukin 17 antagonists including secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, and the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, apremilast.  Expert opinion: Based on the rationale of the involvement of the IL-23/Th17 axis in AS, novel biological agents have been developed and include secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A agent and ustekinumab, an anti-IL-23 antibody. Besides systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA), options also include intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and biologics such as the TNFÎ± inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept; the interleukin (IL) 12/23 antibody ustekinumab; the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra; and the IL-1Î² antibody canakinumab. Objective: To determine whether blockade of the interleukin 23-helper T cell 17 (IL-23-TH17) pathway with ustekinumab represents an efficacious and, based on its proinflammatory cytokine profile, targeted treatment option in PRP. The use of monoclonal antibodies against interleukin (IL)-12 and -23, such as ustekinumab, has considerably reduced the disease burden in many patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, is approved in the USA and Europe for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA.  This study is a retrospective analysis of routine parameter dynamics and laboratory adverse events (LAE) in psoriasis patients on long-term treatment (nâ=â199) with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±-antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept), and the interleukin (IL)12/23-antagonist ustekinumab.  Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit, which is part of interleukins IL-12 and IL-23. The biologic, Ustekinumab (StelaraÂ®, Centocor, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA), is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23 (IL-12 and IL-23). Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. A recent example is ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Centocor Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 protein subunit of human interleukins 12 and 23 with high affinity and specificity, thereby preventing interaction with their surface IL-12RÎ²1 receptor. Discovery and mechanism of ustekinumab: a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 for treatment of immune-mediated disorders. ); (2) Ustekinumab is an inhibitor of interleukins 12 and 23, which are believed to be implicated in the onset of psoriasis. Ustekinumab (Stelara) is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeted against the p40 shared subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. In the past years, the IL-23/Th17 axis has emerged as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PsA. Ustekinumab, a fully human IgG1Îº monoclonal antibody that targets the common subunit p40 of IL-12 and IL-23, has been shown in clinical trials, to be well-tolerated and effective in patients with active PsA. We compared two biologic agents, ustekinumab (an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 blocker) and etanercept (an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha), for the treatment of psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with psoriasis. Anti-p40 antibodies ustekinumab and briakinumab: blockade of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 in the treatment of psoriasis. A randomized trial of Ustekinumab, a human interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12/23. ABT-874 (Abbott Laboratories, Saint-Laurent, QC,) and ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Ortho Biotech, Toronto, ON) are two monoclonal antibodies against interleukins 12 and 23 (IL-12/23), key mediators of T-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1Îº monoclonal antibody that targets the common p40 subunit that is shared by both interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, consequently inhibiting T-cell differentiation along both Th1 and Th17 pathways. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit shared by interleukin 12 and interleukin 23, two naturally occurring protein regulators that play an important role in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA). BACKGROUND Ustekinumab, a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1K monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12/23, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Centocor Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 protein subunit of human interleukins 12 and 23 with high affinity and specificity, thereby preventing interaction with their surface IL-12RÎ²1 receptor. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody belonging to a newly developed class of biological, anti-cytokine medications that notably targets the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and -23, both naturally occurring proteins that are important in regulating the immune system and are understood to play a role in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor Î²1 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. INTRODUCTION Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. BACKGROUND Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL) 12 and IL-23 and inhibits their pharmacological activity. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity and affinity to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, thereby suppressing IL-12- and IL-23-mediated inflammation associated with psoriasis. Two human anti-p40 monoclonal antibodies targeting both IL-12 and IL-23 via their shared p40 subunit have been developed: briakinumab and ustekinumab. evaluate ustekinumab an anti interleukin il 12

response effect was the reduction in pasi score the placebo effect although minor was also integrated into the model none of the covariate factors evaluated eg demographics baseline disease characteristics comorbidities significantly contributed to the between subject variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters the developed exposure response model can serve as a basis to support future alternative dosing regimens for ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis a robust exposure response relationship has been confirmed for ustekinumab in psoriasis. interleukin 23 is thought to be critical to the pathogenesis of psoriasis we compared risankizumab bi 655066 a humanized igg1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin 23 by specifically targeting the p19 subunit and thus prevents interleukin 23 signaling and ustekinumab an interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 inhibitor in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis we randomly assigned a total of 166 patients to receive subcutaneous injections of risankizumab a single 18 mg dose at week 0 or 90 mg or 180 mg doses at weeks 0 4 and 16 or ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg according to body weight at weeks 0 4 and 16 the primary end point was a 90 or greater reduction from baseline in the psoriasis area and severity index pasi score at week 12 at week 12 the percentage of patients with a 90 or greater reduction in the pasi score was 77 64 of 83 patients for risankizumab 90 mg and 180 mg groups pooled as compared with 40 16 of 40 patients for ustekinumab p 0 001 the percentage of patients with a 100 reduction in the pasi score was 45 in the pooled 90 mg and 180 mg risankizumab groups as compared with 18 in the ustekinumab group efficacy was generally maintained up to 20 weeks after the final dose of 90 or 180 mg of risankizumab in the 18 mg and 90 mg risankizumab groups and the ustekinumab group 5 patients 12 6 patients 15 and 3 patients 8 respectively had serious adverse events including two basal cell carcinomas and one major cardiovascular adverse event there were no serious adverse events in the 180 mg risankizumab group in this phase 2 trial selective blockade of interleukin 23 with risankizumab was associated with clinical responses superior to those associated with ustekinumab this trial was not large enough or of long enough duration to draw conclusions about safety funded by boehringer ingelheim clinicaltrials gov number nct02054481. 1 for adults with plaque psoriasis after failure of topical symptomatic treatments and puva therapy several systemic immunosuppressive agents are acceptable for severe disease methotrexate then ciclosporin and possible a tnf alpha antagonist etanercept etc 2 ustekinumab is an inhibitor of interleukins 12 and 23 which are believed to be implicated in the onset of psoriasis it is authorized in the european union for patients who fail to respond to conventional systemic treatments 3 in one trial with a low level of evidence single blind 2 subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab at an interval of 4 weeks appeared to be statistically more effective than twice weekly subcutaneous injections of etanercept for 12 weeks more patients achieved a 75 reduction in the score most widely used to evaluate the extent and intensity of plaque psoriasis lesions pasi score about 71 versus 57 the results beyond this period have not been reported 4 two randomised double blind placebo controlled trials in a total of 1996 patients showed that at least two thirds of patients treated with ustekinumab achieved at least a 75 reduction in their pasi score versus fewer than 4 with placebo 5 in animal studies interleukin 12 and 23 inhibitors cause cancer there is therefore a high risk of cancer developing during prolonged treatment with ustekinumab 6 the main adverse effects identified in clinical trials include infections injection site reactions psychological disorders and development of anti ustekinumab antibodies 7 there is insufficient follow up to evaluate the cardiac risks associated with ustekinumab 8 as maintenance therapy ustekinumab is administered as one subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks this practical advantage compared to tnf alpha antagonists must be weighed against the risks inherent in prolonged immunosuppression 9 in summary for symptomatic relief of patients whose psoriasis poses major problems despite treatment with methotrexate or ciclosporin in the absence of a better alternative it is better to use a tnf alpha antagonist and to avoid exposing patients to the risks associated with ustekinumab particularly its carcinogenic risk. biologic agents offer a range of new therapeutic options for patients with psoriasis however the relative benefit risk profiles of such therapies are not well known we compared two biologic agents ustekinumab an interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 blocker and etanercept an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha for the treatment of psoriasis we randomly assigned 903 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis to receive subcutaneous injections of either 45 or 90 mg of ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4 or high dose etanercept 50 mg

Members of the Betaproteobacteria (i.e. Dechloromonas, Ralstonia, Rhodoferax, Polaromonas, Delftia, Chromobacterium) and the Firmicutes dominated the biostimulated aquifer community. Shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities, conferred in part by multicomponent, branched electron transport systems. metal-reducing Geobacter species  Identifications based on bacterial 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the dominant cultivable bacteria belonged to the genus Bacillus. Members of the genera Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Klebsiella, Microbacterium and Chryseobacterium were also isolated from the LAAs soil samples.  Geobacter Geobacteraceae Geobacteraceae will be responsible for much of the Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction during uranium bioremediation in these sediments.  Our previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial communities involved in uranium bioremediation and energy harvesting are both dominated by microorganisms in the family Geobacteraceae and that the organisms in this family are responsible for uranium bioremediation and electron transfer to electrodes.  the organisms in the family Geobacteraceae that have been found to be associated with metal reduction in previous studies  to stimulate the activity of Geobacter species during in situ uranium bioremediation. Geobacteraceae  Geobacter species are known to be important members of the microbial community: (1) a uranium-contaminated aquifer located in Rifle, CO, USA undergoing in situ bioremediation; Geobacteraceae feoB transcripts in groundwater samples from a site undergoing in situ uranium bioremediation   Geobacteraceae activity during metal reduction in carbon-amended microcosms, with the highest expression observed in the glucose treatment. Geobacter uraniireducens sp. nov., isolated from subsurface sediment undergoing uranium bioremediation. A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterium, strain Rf4T, which conserves energy from dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction concomitant with acetate oxidation, was isolated from subsurface sediment undergoing uranium bioremediation.  . Constant levels of Geobacter ompB transcripts were detected in groundwater during a field experiment in which acetate was added to the subsurface to promote in situ uranium bioremediation.  Geobacter species are the predominant organisms,  Firmicutes were the predominant organisms whereas no Firmicutes sequences were detected in background sediments which did not have the capacity to sorb U(VI), Geobacter species that predominates during in situ uranium bioremediation at this site. As part of an effort to diagnose the physiological status of Geobacter species during in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater,  Geobacter uraniireducens  Geobacter species are often the dominant members of the groundwater community during active bioremediation and the primary organisms catalysing U(VI) reduction. Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strains implicated in hexavalent uranium reduction and immobilization are present in the fractured saprolite subsurface environment at the U.S. Department of Energy Integrated Field-Scale Subsurface Research Challenge (IFC) site near Oak Ridge, TN.  Both enrichments were capable of reducing U(VI) rapidly. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries of the two enrichments revealed that Desulfovibrio spp. are dominant in the sulfate-reducing enrichment, and Clostridium spp. are dominant in the iron-reducing enrichment. . The results demonstrate that Geobacter species can effectively reduce U(VI) Uranium biomineralization by a metal-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from uranium mine waste was characterized for its potential in bioremediation.  Uranium biomineralization by a metal resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from contaminated mine waste. Geobacter-mediated bioremediation of uranium The cytochrome genes detected were primarily from Geobacter sp. Acetate amendment at uranium contaminated sites in Rifle, CO. leads to an initial bloom of Geobacter accompanied by the removal of U(VI) from the groundwater, followed by an increase of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) which are poor reducers of U(VI).

Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. the miR-494 content significantly decreased after endurance exercise in C57BL/6J mice, accompanied by an increase in expression of mtTFA and Foxj3 proteins. These results suggest that miR-494 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis by downregulating mtTFA and Foxj3 during myocyte differentiation and skeletal muscle adaptation to physical exercise. 1) c-miRNA up-regulated by acute exercise before and after sustained training (miR-146a and miR-222), (2) c-miRNA responsive to acute exercise before but not after sustained training (miR-21 and miR-221), (3) c-miRNA responsive only to sustained training (miR-20a), MicroRNA 1 expression was decreased independent of the training modality, and was paralleled by an increased expression of IGF-1 representing a potential target. we investigated the expression of these myomiRs, including miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b and miR-206 in muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis of healthy young males (n = 10) in relation to a hyperinsulinaemicâeuglycaemic clamp as well as acute endurance exercise before and after 12 weeks of endurance training. In resting biopsies, endurance training for 12 weeks decreased basal expression of all four myomiRs (P < 0.05) These results suggest that miR-494 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis by downregulating mtTFA and Foxj3 during myocyte differentiation and skeletal muscle adaptation to physical exercise.

5508685b4b2a315d4100000a	List the diseases that can be treated using Vedolizumab.	A new gut-specific monoclonal antibody, vedolizumab, has been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease, and in continued trials no patients have developed PML.  Finally, several studies were presented on new drugs with new therapeutic targets, such as vedolizumab, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.  We review the role of vedolizumab, a humanized antibody against the Î±4Î²7 - integrin, in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Results from clinical trials show that vedolizumab is effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in active CD and UC and has a very good safety profile. Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. NCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52.  Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab was more effective than placebo as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis. New and emerging treatments for ulcerative colitis: a focus on vedolizumab.  This article reviews the emerging data on the use of vedolizumab for UC.   Newer treatments such as vedolizumab and tofacitinib may represent valuable future therapies. SUMMARY: New therapeutic targets in IBD patients who failed anti-TNF-Î± therapy are urgently required, and tofacitinib, vedolizumab and ustekinumab appear to be the most promising drugs.  BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab, a gut-selective, anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody, has shown preliminary efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).  CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks had an adverse event profile similar to that previously observed. Mean disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score) improved with all 3 doses investigated. The new drugs discussed here are those that disturb lymphocyte homing to the gut (natalizumab, vedolizumab and anti-mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule); one that blocks interleukin (IL)-12 as well as the IL-23/T helper 17 (Th17) axis (ustekinumab) and one that blocks the signaling of multiple cytokines (tofacitinib). Vedolizumab  for Crohn's disease. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the potential role of vedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, for the treatment of CD. All randomised placebo-controlled trials that evaluated vedolizumab for the treatment of CD were reviewed and safety and efficacy data evaluated. EXPERT OPINION: Vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated drug that is an important advance for the treatment of CD. Treatment strategies that appear particularly appealing include selective anti-integrin therapy with vedolizumab (anti-Î±4Î²7), etrolizumab (anti-Î²7 antibody) and PF-00547,659 (anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody), anti-interleukin 12/23p40 therapy with ustekinumab and Janus kinase 1, 2 and 3 inhibition with toafacitinib. We discuss a number of them with specific focus on vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha4beta7 integrin on lymphocytes, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, and tofacitinib, a small molecule targeting Janus-activated kinase. Most likely, these three agents will find their way to the market and offer significant therapeutic alternatives for the management of Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis. Natalizumab, vedolizumab, alicaforsen AJM300, rhuMAb Î²7, CCX282-B, and PF-00547,659 are few of monoclonal antibodies that have shown high promise in trials with the potential for more attractive benefit:risk ratio than currently available therapies. Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we discuss the current treatment options available for patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the history of CAM inhibitors, the current state of development of vedolizumab and its future role in inflammatory bowel disease, if approved by regulatory agencies. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. Several antibodies exist which constitute selection adhesion molecule inhibitors, including Natalizumab, MLN-0002 (Vedolizumab) and ISIS 2302 (Alicaforsen) will be discussed in this review. Vedolizumab for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled phase 2 dose-ranging study. BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic that has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). They are anti CD4+ T cell cytokine including interleukin (IL)-12/23 and IL-17 blockers, selective anti-adhesion molecule known as natalizumab, vedolizumab and alicaforsen, T-cell proliferation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory cytokine, immune stimulator, growth factor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor.  Vedolizumab, a humanized mAb against the Î±4Î²7 integrin for the potential treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Data from phase II clinical trials of vedolizumab demonstrated efficacy with an attractive safety profile, especially in ulcerative colitis. Large phase III, multicenter trials in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will provide valuable data for the ongoing development of vedolizumab, which might evolve as a new anti-inflammatory treatment option for the management of therapy-refractory patients. The development of a new specific molecule, vedolizumab, is currently under investigation in a large clinical trial. This novel specific anti-integrin drug seems to hold promise in the treatment of gut inflammation. The binding specificity and selective antagonism of vedolizumab, an anti-alpha4beta7 integrin therapeutic antibody in development for inflammatory bowel diseases. These pharmacologic properties of vedolizumab, in conjunction with the gastrointestinal tropism of alpha(4)beta(7) integrin function, may ultimately confer an improved risk-to-benefit profile for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. In the Crohn's disease study that included maintenance treatment, vedolizumab was significantly more effective at 52Â weeks than placebo in both endpoints (clinical remission was the only primary endpoint in the maintenance study) Vedolizumab is a useful addition to the treatment options available for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52	[['Ulcerative colitis'], ["Crohn's disease"]]

56a37e33496b62f23f000003	List types of avoided words in bacterial genomes	Avoidance of palindromic words in bacterial and archaeal genomes: a close connection with restriction enzymes. Short palindromic sequences (4, 5 and 6 bp palindromes) are avoided at a statistically significant level in the genomes of several bacteria, including the completely sequenced Haemophilus influenzae and Synechocystis sp. genomes and in the complete genome of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii. Palindromes corresponding to sites for restriction enzymes from other species are also avoided, albeit less significantly, suggesting that in the course of evolution bacterial DNA has been exposed to a wide spectrum of restriction enzymes, probably as the result of lateral transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids and prophages Palindromic words appear to accumulate in DNA once it becomes isolated from restriction-modification systems, as demonstrated by the case of organellar genomes In certain cases, a comparison of avoided palindromic words in taxonomically related bacteria shows a pattern of relatedness of their R-M systems. Recognition sites for type II restriction and modification enzymes in genomes of several bacteria are recognized as semi-palindromic motifs and are avoided at a significant degree. On the basis of the set of most avoided words, and in accordance to the IUPAC coding standards, suggestions are made regarding potential recognition sequences.

56be1723ef6e39474100000c	List symptoms of Gradenigo's syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Gradenigo's syndrome is nowadays a rare condition characterized by a triad of otorrhea, facial pain with trigeminal nerve involvement and abducens nerve palsy. Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare but life threatening complication of acute otitis media (AOM), which includes a classic triad of otitis media, deep facial pain and ipsilateral abducens nerve paralysis.  We report a case of typical Gradenigo's syndrome, including left abducens nerve palsy, left facial pain and paresthesia in V1 and V2 distribution of trigeminal nerve caused by solitary osseous plasmacytoma of the left petrous apex. BACKGROUND: Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare disease, which is characterized by the triad of the following conditions: suppurative otitis media, pain in the distribution of the first and the second division of trigeminal nerve, and abducens nerve palsy. RESULTS: It was after Gradenigo that the well-known syndrome consisting of diplopia and facial pain due to a middle ear infection was named. Gradenigo's syndrome, the triad of suppurative otitis media, abducens nerve palsy and pain in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, remains a rare complication of otitis media. In 1904, Giuseppe Gradenigo published his case series on the triad of ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy, facial pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution, and suppurative otitis media, which would subsequently be referred to as Gradenigo syndrome	[['otitis media'], ['deep facial pain'], ['abducens nerve paralysis']]

54c225bcf693c3b16b000002	Mutations of which genes have been associated with Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)?	Mutation in four genes â RYR2, CASQ2, TRDN, and CALM1 â is known to cause CPVT or related phenotypes of adrenergically induced life-threatening arrhythmias. The presence of other as-yet unidentified loci is postulated  some KCNJ2 mutation carriers lack the ATS triad and sometimes share the phenotype of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) In 50 Japanese probands from unrelated families who satisfied clinical criteria for CPVT, genetic testing was conducted in all exons on 3 CPVT-related genes: cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) and inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (KCNJ2) point mutations in RYR2, the gene encoding for the cardiac isoform of the RyR (RyR2), are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by the development of adrenergically-mediated ventricular tachycardia in individuals with an apparently normal heart. Recessive CPVT variants are due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene.  Recent studies have shown that CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) genes. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmogenic disorder associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) genes.

51bdf045047fa84d1d000003	Which are the Atg8 homologs in human?	Strikingly, in addition to ULK1 and ULK2, ATG13 and FIP200 interacted with human ATG8 proteins, all with strong preference for the GABARAP subfamily. GABARAPL1 belongs to the small family of GABARAP proteins (including GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2/GATE-16), one of the two subfamilies of the yeast Atg8 orthologue. Identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1 Stbd1 has been reported to interact with a known autophagy protein, GABARAPL1, a member of the Atg8 family. Atg8 is a yeast protein involved in the autophagic process and in particular in the elongation of autophagosomes. In mammals, several orthologs have been identified and are classed into two subfamilies: the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, referred to simply as the LC3 or GABARAP families. GABARAPL1 (GABARAP-like protein 1), one of the proteins belonging to the GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein) family The proteins that make up the GABARAP family demonstrate conservation of their amino acid sequences and protein structures. In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16). The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. ATG3 is the E2-like enzyme necessary for ATG8/LC3 lipidation during autophagy. Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming autophagic membranes, have been identified. At least eight different Atg8 orthologs belonging to two subfamilies (LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP) occur in mammalian cells, but their individual roles and modes of action are largely unknown. truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1) Structure of GATE-16, membrane transport modulator and mammalian ortholog of autophagocytosis factor Aut7p. The yeast ortholog of GATE-16 is the autophagocytosis factor Aut7p. GATE-16 is also closely related to the GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified.

5ac2776195d0062724000006	List diseases caused by protein glutamine expanded repeats	Huntington's Disease (HD) is a fatally inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded glutamine repeat in the N-terminal region of the huntingtin (HTT) protein.  An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expanding CAG triplet repeats that code for polyglutamine. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in DRPLA protein. The genetic defect in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is expansion of the CAG repeat. The mutant gene is translated into the protein which carries the expanded glutamine repeat.

56c1f005ef6e39474100003a	Which interleukins are inhibited by Dupilumab?	The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication "atopic dermatitis" were published in 2014. These motivated (1) to extend the studies to dupilumab and (2) to clinically test antagonization of other target molecules of TH2 polarized, atopic inflammation, e.g., IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, TSLP, and CRTH2. A Among the recently developed antiasthma biologic drugs, the monoclonal antibody dupilumab is very promising because of its ability to inhibit the biological effects of both IL-4 and IL-13. Indeed, dupilumab prevents IL-4/13 interactions with the Î±-subunit of the IL-4 receptor complex.  BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.   In early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting IL-4 receptor Î±, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of IL-4/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized. Examples include the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with severe refractory atopic asthma characterized by raised serum total IgE, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab in patients with recurrent eosinophilic exacerbations characterized by blood and sputum eosinophilia despite high doses of corticosteroids, and lebrikizumab, pitrakinra, dupilumab, and tralokinumab that target the IL-4/IL-13 signalling pathways in patients with eosinophilic asthma or raised serum periostin. BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe asthma remains poorly treated. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. With respect to immune dysregulation, dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit was recently shown to be effective in treating adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. Indeed, dupilumab prevents IL-4/13 interactions with the Î±-subunit of the IL-4 receptor complex. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.  BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. The blockade by dupilumab of these key drivers of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of related diseases, including atopic dermatitis.

56c1f007ef6e39474100003b	Tumor-treating fields are effective for treatment of which cancers?	Alternating electric fields (tumor-treating fields therapy) can improve chemotherapy treatment efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo. e evaluated the effects of combining TTFields with standard chemotherapeutic agents on several NSCLC cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all cell lines.  Together, these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC. Response patterns of recurrent glioblastomas treated with tumor-treating fields. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients. The effect of field strength on glioblastoma multiforme response in patients treated with the NovoTTFâ¢-100A system.  An ongoing trial is assessing its efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been FDA-approved for recurrent GBM. We present three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the effects of each adjustment. The first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ.   A second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted accordingly.  A phase I/II trial of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy in combination with pemetrexed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Promising preclinical data have led to a single arm phase I/II trial in NSCLC patients.METHODS: Forty-two inoperable stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC patients who had had tumor progression received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) iv q3w together with daily TTFields therapy until disease progression. The median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TTFields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for NSCLC is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone. TTFields improved disease control within the treatment field and a phase III study is planned to further investigate its role as a novel treatment in NSCLC. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe.  The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first device, the NovoTTF-100Aâ¢, that uses this technology and is indicated for use in progressive glioblastoma multiforme after standard therapies have failed. Promising clinical trial results will likely lead to expanded uses in primary brain tumors and other cancer types.  Long-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields. Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. Our center was the first to apply TTField treatment to histologically proven GBM in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. We report two cases of GBM and two cases of RGBM treated by TTField therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating TTField therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor.  Furthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. The second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed.  EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types.  CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TTFields alone and in combination with paclitaxel and doxorubicin effectively reduce the viability of both wild type and MDR cell sub-lines and thus can potentially be used as an effective treatment of drug resistant tumors. Alternating electric fields (TTFields) inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors. This novel treatment modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors. BACKGROUND: The present study explores the efficacy and toxicity of combining a new, non-toxic, cancer treatment modality, termed Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), with chemotherapeutic treatment in-vitro, in-vivo and in a pilot clinical trial. In addition, we studied the effects of combining chemotherapy with TTFields in an animal tumor model and in a pilot clinical trial in recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM patients.RESULTS: The efficacy of TTFields-chemotherapy combination in-vitro was found to be additive with a tendency towards synergism for all drugs and cell lines tested (combination index A pilot study with very low-intensity, intermediate-frequency electric fields in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open, prospective pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of TTFields treatment in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors using the NovoTTF100A(TM) device. Outcomes showed 1 partial response of a treated skin metastasis from a primary breast cancer, 3 cases where tumor growth was arrested during treatment, and 1 case of disease progression. One mesothelioma patient experienced lesion regression near TTFields with simultaneous tumor stability or progression in distal areas.CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients in this study is small, the lack of therapy toxicity and the efficacy observed in data gathered to date indicate the potential of TTFields as a new treatment modality for solid tumors, definitely warranting further investigation. Mitotic disruption and reduced clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by tumor treating fields. OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.

5c73acf57c78d6947100008c	Which features are evaluated with the CRAFFT screening test?	 The New Mexico Department of Health school-based health centers (SBHCs) universally administer a validated screen, the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble), for adolescent substance use concerns; however, quality assurance efforts revealed that SBHC providers needed more information at the point of screening to initiate brief interventions for students with positive CRAFFT screens. We present the results of the reliability and concurrent validity of the CRAFFT (acronym for Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble) substance abuse screening instrument among residents of youth correctional facilities in Lagos, Nigeria.  The Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) and the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Family/Friends, Trouble questionnaire (CRAFFT) are used to this end.

554101d0234c5a7c75000002	Which receptor(s) recognize lysosomal hydrolases in trans-Golgi network (TGN)?	The majority of the enzymes leave the TGN after modification with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues, which are specifically recognized by M6P receptors (MPRs), ensuring their transport to the endosomal/lysosomal system. M6P receptors play a major role in the intracellular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in mammalian cells Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are known to be shuttled between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, thereby several lysosomal hydrolases are delivered through the endocytic pathway into lysosomes. Most soluble lysosomal hydrolases are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and delivered to the lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). certain soluble lysosomal hydrolases, is sorted and trafficked to the lysosomes by sortilin. Mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) transport lysosomal hydrolases from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes. Recently, the multi-ligand receptor sortilin has also been implicated in this transport A shortcut to the lysosome: the mannose-6-phosphate-independent pathway several lines of evidence suggest the existence of alternative processes of lysosomal targeting. Among them, the two that are mediated by the M6P alternative receptors, lysosomal integral membrane protein (LIMP-2) and sortilin, have gained unequivocal support. delivery of mannose 6-phosphate receptors carrying lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal system The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) mediates sorting of lysosomal hydrolase precursors from the TGN to endosomes. mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) recognition marker on lysosomal hydrolases. The delivery of mannose 6-phosphate receptors carrying lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal system is mediated by selective incorporation of the receptor-hydrolase complexes into vesicular transport carriers (TCs) that are coated with clathrin and the adaptor proteins, GGA and AP-1. Mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) transport lysosomal hydrolases from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors carry newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, then return to the trans-Golgi network for another round of enzyme delivery. In this way, the M6P receptors help package the hydrolases into vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi network to deliver their contents to endosomes that ultimately will develop into mature lysosomes, where recently-delivered hydrolases may start digesting the endocyted material. However, LS fibroblasts displayed reduced mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR)-mediated re-uptake of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase B. In addition, endosome-to-trans Golgi network (TGN) transport of MPRs was decreased significantly, leading to higher levels of cell surface MPRs and their enrichment in enlarged, retromer-positive endosomes in OCRL-depleted HeLa cells. The M6P groups are then recognized by two independent transmembrane M6P receptors, present in the trans-Golgi network: the cation-independent M6P receptor and/or the cation-dependent M6P receptor. Two related mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) recognize this feature in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and deliver the hydrolases to the late endosome. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes to mediate sorting of lysosomal hydrolases. The M6P groups are then recognized by two independent transmembrane M6P receptors, present in the trans-Golgi network: the cation-independent M6P receptor and/or the cation-dependent M6P receptor Mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) transport lysosomal hydrolases from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes The delivery of mannose 6-phosphate receptors carrying lysosomal hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal system is mediated by selective incorporation of the receptor-hydrolase complexes into vesicular transport carriers (TCs) that are coated with clathrin and the adaptor proteins, GGA and AP-1 Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are known to be shuttled between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, thereby several lysosomal hydrolases are delivered through the endocytic pathway into lysosomes The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes to mediate sorting of lysosomal hydrolases Two related mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) recognize this feature in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and deliver the hydrolases to the late endosome	[['mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs)'], ['sortilin'], ['lysosomal integral membrane protein (LIMP-2)'], ['cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)']]
56f3f0f02ac5ed1459000017	Which are the most widely used computational methods for the identification of CRMs (cis-regulatory modules)?	Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). However, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs. In this work we present CisMiner, a novel methodology to detect putative CRMs by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. CisMiner allows to perform a blind search of CRMs without any prior information about target CRMs nor limitation in the number of motifs. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method 'CPModule' the optimal choice of method varies depending on species and composition of the sequences in question. When discriminating CRMs from non-coding regions, those methods considering evolutionary conservation have a stronger predictive power than methods designed to be run on a single genome. Different CRM representations and search strategies rely on different CRM properties, and different methods can complement one another. For example, some favour homotypical clusters of binding sites, while others perform best on short CRMs. Furthermore, most methods appear to be sensitive to the composition and structure of the genome to which they are applied.  CisMiner: genome-wide in-silico cis-regulatory module prediction by fuzzy itemset mining Additionally, we make a number of new predictions on combinatorial regulation of these five key TFs with other TFs documented in TRANSFAC. Due to degeneracy of nucleotide content among binding site instances or motifs, and intricate &apos;grammatical organization&apos; of motifs within cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), extant pattern matching-based in silico motif search methods often suffer from impractically high false positive rates, especially in the context of analyzing large genomic datasets, and noisy position weight matrices which characterize binding sites Genome-wide identification of cis-regulatory motifs and modules underlying gene coregulation using statistics and phylogeny. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. It can identify &apos;orthologous&apos; CRMs without multiple alignments. These methods are problematic when binding sites are not well aligned in multiple alignments or when the number of input known motifs is large. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.	[['motif conservation'], ['fuzzy itemset mining'], ['combinatorial methods']]
5c57041807647bbc4b000015	What 2 biological processes are regulated by STAMP2 in adipocytes?	Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues. we identified the six-transmembrane protein STAMP2 as a critical modulator of this integrated response system of inflammation and metabolism in adipocytes.  Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice. Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues.  These results suggest that Stamp1 and Stamp2 play critical roles in adipogenesis, but through different mechanisms. CONTEXT Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice. These results suggest that STAMP2 is crucial for normal ASC conversion into adipocytes and their metabolic function, as well as their ability to facilitate PCa growth in vivo. We report that Stamp2 is expressed in human and mouse macrophages, is regulated upon differentiation or activation, acts as an anti-inflammatory protein, and regulates foam cell formation. CONTEXT Six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counter-regulator of inflammation and insulin resistance according to findings in mice. Taken together, TIARP/STAMP2 is highly upregulated in 3T3-L1 cells and hMSC-Ad by IL-1beta and might, therefore, modulate proinflammatory and insulin resistance-inducing effects of IL-1beta.<br> <b>CONTEXT</b>: Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice.

54fb4b34d176fff445000001	Which transcription factors (TFs) participate in the formation of the interferon-beta (IFN-b) enhanceosome?	The dimer formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun transcription factors is one of the main components of the human interferon-beta enhanceosome. The induction of IFN transcription resulted from the activation of the components of the IFN-beta enhanceosome, i.e. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun. Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene. Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3).  Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB. Transcriptional activation of the virus inducible enhancer of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, IRFs and the architectural protein of the mammalian high mobility group I(Y) [HMG I(Y)]. Here, we demonstrate that the first step in enhanceosome assembly, i.e. HMG I(Y)-dependent recruitment of NF-kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun to the enhancer, is facilitated by discrete regions of HMG I and is mediated by allosteric changes induced in the DNA by HMG I(Y) and not by protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and these proteins. However, we show that completion of the enhanceosome assembly process requires protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and the activators. Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP.  The transcriptional coactivators CBP and P/CAF are required for activation of transcription from the IFN beta enhanceosome. We show that CBP and P/CAF acetylate HMG I(Y), the essential architectural component required for enhanceosome assembly, at distinct lysine residues, causing distinct effects on transcription. The transcriptional activity of an in vitro assembled human interferon-beta gene enhanceosome is highly synergistic. This synergy requires five distinct transcriptional activator proteins (ATF2/c-JUN, interferon regulatory factor 1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB), the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y), and the correct alignment of protein-binding sites on the face of the DNA double helix. In addition, we provide evidence that recruitment of the holoenzyme by the enhanceosome is due, at least in part, to interactions between the enhanceosome and the transcriptional coactivator CREB, cAMP responsive element binding protein (CBP).  Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y). Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators. A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on the DNA helix. We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex (enhanceosome). This multicomponent complex includes at least three distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y). Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome. Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y)	[['NF-kappa B (p50/p65)'], ['ATF-2'], ['c-jun'], ['IRF-3'], ['IRF-7'], ['IRF-1']]

Here we show that the NPC basket proteins Nup1 and Nup60 directly induce membrane curvature by amphipathic helix insertion into the lipid bilayer Moreover, the association of TREX-2 with the NPC requires the basket nucleoporins NUP153 and TPR, but is independent of transcription.   In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket components, were unevenly distributed in the NE and, unlike wild-type NPCs, were mobile within the NE Incorporation of the nuclear pore basket protein nup153 into nuclear pore structures is dependent upon lamina assembly: evidence from cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs. Using light and EM immunolocalization, we determined that mammalian Tpr is concentrated within the nuclear basket of the pore complex in a distribution similar to Nup153 and Nup98. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy localize vertebrate Nup93 at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear entry to the gated channel of the pore. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. Nup153 is a molecular constituent of the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that plays a critical role in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins. The nucleoporins Nup60p, Nup2p, and Nup1p form part of the nuclear basket structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear pore complex (NPC). By postembedding immunoelectron microscopy, we have mapped the positions of several human NPC proteins relative to the NPC core and its associated basket, including Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, Nup153, Nup205, and the coiled coil-dominated 267-kDa protein Tpr. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153. When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. One such protein, the nucleoporin Nup153, is localized to the nuclear basket of the pore complex and has been shown to be a central component of the nuclear transport machinery. Here, one SLAP is identified as the nuclear pore complex protein Nup153, one member of the F/GXFG motif-containing nucleoporins.  Nup133 Is Required for Proper Nuclear Pore Basket Assembly and Dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells.Nup133 belongs to the Y-complex, a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold.  The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins.The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large proteinaceous structure through which bidirectional transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (NE) takes place.  To further assess their contributions to NPC and basket architecture, the genes encoding Nup93, Nup96, Nup107, and Nup205 were posttranscriptionally silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, complementing recent RNAi experiments on Nup153 and Tpr. Immunogold-labeling for Nup98 also results in preferential labeling of NPC core regions, whereas Nup153 is shown to bind via its amino-terminal domain to the nuclear coaxial ring linking the NPC core structures and Tpr. Ulp1, whose maintenance at nuclear pores depends on the Nup84 complex, impacts on THO-dependent gene expression, whereas the nuclear basket-associated Mlp1/Pml39 proteins prevent pre-mRNA export at a later stage, contributing to mRNA quality control.

553e1aa5a3cf796f71000003	What types of DNA mutations are induced by 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP)?	2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. a G:C-->T:A transversion, the same type of mutation elicited by 2-OH-dATP. 2-OH-dATP mainly elicited a G x C to A x T transition, and a G x C to T x A transversion to a lesser extent. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations. Of the substitutions, a G.C-->A.T transition including a tandem (CC-->TT) mutation was mainly observed. 2-OH-dATP elicits G.C-->T.A transversions the alpha subunit incorporated 2-OH-dATP 10 times more frequently opposite T than opposite G. 2-OH-dATP elicited G-->T transversions, indicating the formation of G*2-OH-dATP pairs. Interestingly, 2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. The polymerase almost exclusively incorporated 8-hydroxy-dGTP (8-OH-dGTP) opposite template adenine (A) at 60% efficiency of normal dTTP incorporation, and incorporated 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP) opposite template thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C) at substantial rates. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations. Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that the alpha subunit incorporated 2-OH-dATP 10 times more frequently opposite T than opposite G. On the other hand, the incorporation of 2-OH-dATP opposite T by the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment was 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than that opposite G. These results indicate that the misinsertion specificity of 2-OH-dATP differs between replicative and repair-type DNA polymerases, and provide a biochemical basis for the mutations induced by 2-OH-dATP in E. coli. Interestingly, 2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations. On the other hand, in an experiment using the Klenow fragment, incorporation of 2-OH-dATP was observed only opposite T. Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that incorporation of 2-OH-dATP by DNA polymerase alpha opposite T was favored over that opposite C by a factor of only 4.5. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations.

5a75df9883b0d9ea66000002	Which cancers compose Carney's triad?	New adrenal tumors have also been associated with nonhereditary Carney's triad. Carney designated the combination of 3 rare soft tissue tumors (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma) as a syndrome.  In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. A case of bilateral multiple pulmonary chondroma: necessity of follow-up for Carney's triad. We report a case of pulmonary bilateral multiple chondromas that were possibly an initial clinical presentation of Carney's triad.  These chondromas were possibly components of Carney's triad, because each nodule had a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and did not have an entrapped epithelium and fat. A curious association of three rare tumours was described by Carney in 1977. 'Carney's triad' characteristically includes multifocal pulmonary chondroma, gastric stromal sarcoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  We report a female teenager who presented with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach and a paraganglioneuroma. She later developed a pulmonary chondroma, fulfilling the requirements of Carney's triad. A 34-year-old man, who had undergone the gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and para-aortic paraganglioma 3 years before, was found to have a left lung tumor on a computed tomography. The tumor was revealed to be a pulmonary hamartoma, and diagnosed as Carney's triad. INTRODUCTION: Carney's triad is a rare pathogenic entity which consists of the association in young women of multiple condromatosis in the lung, gastric leiomyosarcoma, and extradrenal paraganglioma; although the presence of three at the same time is not required for its diagnosis. Interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) hyperplasia has been documented in conditions associated with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (familial GIST syndromes, Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease) and rarely in the vicinity of sporadic GISTs. Multiple gastric tumors and pararenal non functioning paraganglioma were found. No chondromas were detected. An incomplete Carney's Triad was diagnosed.  Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) occur mostly as sporadic solitary lesions involving the tubular GI tract and are only rarely associated with other benign or malignant neoplasms or occur as part of a multi-neoplastic disease as in the setting of Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease. Carney's triad is a very unusual syndrome, associating three different tumours on the same patient, a young woman generally: a gastric leiomyoblastoma, a pulmonary chondroma and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  This report encourages clinicians to consider a diagnosis of Carney's triad in patients with multifocal gastric stromal sarcoma, extraadrenal paraganglioma (predominantly mediastinal), or pulmonary chondroma. Carney's triad represents the association of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma. Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome. Carney's triad is a syndrome of unknown etiology, representing a combination of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, bronchial chondromas and vagal, adrenal or paraadrenal paragangliomas. Two of the Carney's triad components-the paragangliomas and the gastrointestinal stromal tumors-are potentially lethal. Carney's triad, a rare disorder affecting young females, is characterized by the presence of at least two of the three following neoplasms: gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma. Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women. We communicate a case with the Carney triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondromatosis and extra-adrenal paraganglioma). The etiology of the Carney's triad (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas, and paragangliomas) is unknown, and only 57 cases have been reported since its identification in 1977. Carney's triad is defined by the coexistence of at least two of three rare disorders, including gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant leiomyoblastoma), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma, most often extra-adrenal and functioning.

57220e400fd6f91b68000015	Which are the most common symptoms in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome?	Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by proximal limb muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased deep-tendon reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. There are 2 forms of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: one most frequently associated with small-cell lung cancer (P-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and the other that is a pure autoimmune form (NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) LEMS weakness typically involves lower and upper limbs and the proximal muscles are predominantly affected. A significant proportion of patients also have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. LEMS recognition is based on clinical, electrophysiological and immunological criteria. Nearly 50-60% of patients with LEMS have an underlying tumour that, in almost all cases, is a small-cell lung cancer; In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels reduce the quantal release of acetylcholine, causing muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. More than half of the affected patients have associated small cell lung cancer The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. Primary respiratory failure as the presenting symptom in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

5a68fd01b750ff445500001b	What is included in the fourth generation HIV test?	Diagnosing acute HIV infection at point of care: a retrospective analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of a fourth-generation point-of-care test for detection of HIV core protein p24. Previous evaluation of the fourth-generation Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo POCT showed only 50% sensitivity for HIV core protein p24 (p24 antigen) detection, which is suboptimal for diagnosis of acute HIV infection with limited advantage over third-generation POCT. CONCLUSIONS: This new POCT shows improved sensitivity for detection of p24 antigen and may be of value for clinical use in detecting acute HIV infection. While fourth generation antigen-antibody combination assays have been successful in high-resource settings, rapid point of care (POC) versions of these assays have yet to demonstrate high sensitivity to detect AHI.  STUDY DESIGN: A total of 30,201 sera were tested for HIV diagnosis using Abbott ArchitectÂ®HIV-Ag/Ab-Combo 4th-gen-EIA at a hospital in Spain during 17 months.  OBJECTIVE: To determine if fourth-generation antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) would have detected HIV infection earlier than the third-generation RDT used in MTN-003 (VOICE). BACKGROUND: Fourth generation assays detect simultaneously antibodies for HIV and the p24 antigen, identifying HIV infection earlier than previous generation tests. The status of clients on ART was additionally confirmed by fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combo tests, Architect and Genscreen Ultra. INTRODUCTION: We describe the overall accuracy and performance of a serial rapid HIV testing algorithm used in community-based HIV testing in the context of a population-based household survey conducted in two sub-districts of uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, against reference fourth-generation HIV-1/2 antibody and p24 antigen combination immunoassays. The sample was later routinely tested with a fourth generation antigen/antibody assay as per local protocol and was strongly positive. The fourth-generation HIV EIA was positive presumably because it detects p24 HIV antigen as well as antibodies, unlike rapid HIV tests and third-generation HIV EIAs.This case highlights not only the importance of frontline providers to understand the different testing methodologies for HIV screening and their limitations but the importance of clinical suspicion as well. This second diagnostic window was caused by the absence of HIV specific antibodies and the decline of HIV p24 antigen concentrations below the detection limits of the fourth generation assays. Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the test-negative window to 11 to 14 days.	[['antibodies for HIV'], ['p24 antigen']]
56be0da3ef6e394741000007	List Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Triad.	Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the triad of thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a relatively rare disorder described by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Until recently, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), conventionally defined in the pediatric literature as a syndrome of the triad of renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia without a prodrome of hemorrhagic diarrhea, has received little attention in adult practice because the patients are commonly given the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or TTP/HUS and treated as TTP with plasma exchange, augmented in refractory cases with rituximab and sometimes even splenectomy.  Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is rare and comprises the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.  Hemolyitic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by triad of acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia, has considerable morbidity and mortality and is known to be associated with diarrheal illness.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare thrombotic complication characterized by a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.

5e30ee25fbd6abf43b00003f	List features of the SAM syndrome.	Severe skin dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a rare life-threatening inherited condition caused by bi-allelic mutations in DSG1 encoding desmoglein 1.  Recently, homozygous mutations in the desmoglein-1 (DSG1) gene and heterozygous mutation in the desmoplakin (DSP) gene have been demonstrated to be associated with severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 615508).

552435602c8b63434a000009	Which genes/proteins have been found to inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)?	Interestingly, the Cdk inhibitor p18(Ink4c) was induced in the transgenic pineal glands independently of p53, and transgenic mice that lacked Ink4c developed invasive PNET, although at an older age than those lacking p53. Our finding that the Cdk4 inhibitor p18(Ink4c) is a tumor suppressor in cyclin D1-driven PNET suggests that pharmacologic interventions to inhibit Cdk4 activity may be a useful chemoprevention or therapeutic strategy in cancer driven by primary RB pathway disruption. Our previous studies showed that while both specific CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4A (P16) and gankyrin bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in similar fashion, only P16 inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4. Recent biological studies of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 have proposed that p21 C-terminal domain (p21(CT)) plays a key role as a potent Cdk4 inhibitor.  Especially, our data suggests that the D(149)FYHSKRR(156) region of p21 is critical for Cdk4 binding, indicating that the major driving force for complex originates from hydrophobic interaction between p21 and Cdk4. We show that c-Myc prevents induction of the cdk4 inhibitor p15(Ink4b) and the subsequent inhibition of G(1) cdks by TGF-beta. CDK activity is modulated by inhibitors such as p15INK4b and p16INK4a. Loss of function of p15INK4b and p16INK4a (multiple tumor suppressor-I and CDK4 inhibitor) determines impairment in the control of the cell cycle and contributes to the transformation of several cell types.  D-type cyclins, in association with the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the present study, we analyzed human ovarian carcinoma cell lines for abnormalities in the tumor suppressor gene Rb (retinoblastoma) and in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor genes (p16INK4 and p15INK4B) using molecular biology techniques. These data suggest that abnormalities of Rb and CDK4 inhibitor genes (p16INK4, p15INK4B) may be involved in human ovarian carcinogenesis. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1.  The p15 and p16 CDK4 inhibitor genes map within the chromosome band 9p21 region deleted frequently in malignant mesothelioma and other cancers. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) inhibitor (p16INK4/MTS1/CDKN2) gene has been recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of the high frequency of homozygous deletion observed in numerous human tumor cell lines, including leukemias.  The identification of a cdk4 inhibitor, p16INK4, as a target for mutations in cultured tumor lines and primary tumors suggested that RB activity may be affected in these cells. Roles of cyclin A-Cdk2 as a p27 target and cyclin D2-Cdk4 as a p27 reservoir may result from the differential ability of bound p27 to inhibit the kinase subunit in these complexes. Role of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor gene family p15, p16, p18 and p19 in leukemia and lymphoma. Identification of functional elements of p18INK4C essential for binding and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6. One of the INK4 molecules, p16, is also known as multiple tumor suppressor and has been found to be mutated or deleted in various tumors and cell lines. We have previously identified p18 as a member of the INK4 family. Members of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors specifically bind and inhibit the G1-specific CDK molecules CDK4 and CDK6.

5506e2ff8e1671127b00000d	Which are the subunits of the IkB protein kinase (IKK)?	NEMO (NF-ÎºB essential modulator) associates with catalytic subunits IKKÎ± and IKKÎ² to form the IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex and is a key regulator of NF-ÎºB pathway signaling. All known NF-ÎºB activators converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex to activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathways. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits (IKKÎ± and IKKÎ²) and a regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKÎ³ that regulates the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway, whereas IKKÎ± regulates the non-canonical pathway.  The IKK protein complex is comprised of IKKÎ±, IKKÎ² and NEMO subunits, with IKKÎ² thought to play the dominant role in modulating NF-ÎºB activity.  The IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex plays a crucial role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB by phosphorylating an inhibitory molecule IÎºBÎ±. Recently, we showed that IKK2 (also called IKKÎ²), a catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, induces immunoglobulin E-mediated degranulation in mast cells by phosphorylating SNAP-23, the target-membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE). The depletion of any of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NFÎºB (IÎºB) kinase (IKKÎ±, IKKÎ², IKKÎ³/NEMO), each of which is essential for the canonical NFÎºB activation pathway, limits autophagy induction by physiological or pharmacological triggers, while constitutive active IKK subunits suffice to stimulate autophagy.  NF-ÎºB activation is tightly regulated by the IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits IKKÎ± and IKKÎ², and a regulatory subunit IKKÎ³/NEMO. Activation of the classical NF-ÎºB pathway is mediated through the activity of the IKK kinase complex, which consists of a heterotrimer of IKKÎ±, IKKÎ², and IKKÎ³ subunits.  NF-kB is a key regulator of inflammation and immunity in cancer development. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-Î±, -Î² and -Î³.  Activation of NF-ÎºB involves the IÎºB kinase (IKK)-complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKÎ± and IKKÎ², and a regulatory scaffold protein, IKKÎ³. The IKK kinase complex is the core element of the NF-kappaB cascade. It is essentially made of two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKgamma. Additional components may exist, transiently or permanently, but their characterization is still unsure. Activation of NF-kappaB subunits is regulated by the upstream IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex which contains IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma; the latter also known as NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). Proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation requires the IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). Inhibition of NF-kappaB by suppressing the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway, for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKK1, IKK2 and NEMO) triggers apoptosis in such cells.  The IkappaB-Kinase (IKK) complex is a multisubunit protein complex crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB proteins and thus controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. Activation of a large multisubunit protein kinase, called the inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, is central to the induction of the family of transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB. IKK is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory IKKgamma subunit. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-Î±, -Î² and -Î³	[['IKKalpha', 'IKKÎ±', 'IKK1'], ['IKKbeta', 'IKKÎ²', 'IKK2'], ['IKKgamma', 'IKKÎ³', 'NEMO']]
5925227670f9fc6f0f000020	Which enzymes are responsible for base J creation in Trypanosoma brucei?	Synthesis of the modified thymine base, beta-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil or J, within telomeric DNA of Trypanosoma brucei correlates with the bloodstream form specific epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes involved in antigenic variation.  We have recently proposed a model in which chromatin remodeling by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein (JBP2) regulates the developmental and de novo site-specific localization of J synthesis within bloodstream form trypanosome DNA. JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes. The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis.   We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis. Two thymidine hydroxylases differentially regulate the formation of glucosylated DNA at regions flanking polymerase II polycistronic transcription units throughout the genome of Trypanosoma brucei. We have previously characterized two thymidine-hydroxylases (TH), JBP1 and JBP2, which regulate J-biosynthesis. JBP2 is a chromatin re-modeling protein that induces de novo J-synthesis, allowing JBP1, a J-DNA binding protein, to stimulate additional J-synthesis. JBP2 and JBP1 are capable of stimulating de novo J-synthesis. Chromosome-internal J deposition is primarily mediated by JBP1, whereas JBP2-stimulated J deposition at the telomeric regions.  Î²-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes. Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein. The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive.   The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J. Î²-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU).	[['JBP1'], ['JBP2'], ['JGT']]
54fc9b236ad7dcbc12000005	List adenosine A2A receptor antagonists that are used for Parkinson's disease treatment.	Adenosine A2A antagonists, such as istradefylline, improve motor function in PD, but their effect on cognitive impairment has not been determined. Both istradefylline and preladenant have demonstrated moderate efficacy in reducing off time in PD patients with motor fluctuations.   The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments.  Istradefylline (KW-6002) is the first of several adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in development for PD to advance to phase III clinical trials. Initial studies indicate that in patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa, addition of istradefylline reduces 'off' time.  These include alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, fipamezole), adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (eg, istradefylline), AMPA receptor antagonists (eg, talampanel), neuronal synchronization modulators (eg, levetiracetam) and agents that interact with serotonergic systems such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonists (eg, sarizotan) and 5-HT2A antagonists (eg, quetiapine).  BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist administered as adjunctive treatment to levodopa for 12 weeks in a double-blind manner in Parkinsons disease patients with motor complications in Japan. Istradefylline, a novel adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, for the treatment of Parkinsons disease.

56bdfa73ef6e394741000003	List symptoms of Hakim Triad.	Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures. Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies.  INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. SalomÃ³n Hakim first identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in BogotÃ¡, Colombia.  Although several reports of cases with the characteristic clinical manifestations of normal pressure hydrocephalus--progressive dementia, gait difficulty and urinary incontinence--have been published earlier, it was Adams and Hakim who emphasized the clinical triad and the effect of shunting the cerebrospinal fluid as a means of treatment.

5a67a207b750ff4455000008	List indications for palivizumab for treatment of RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 	 Palivizumab reduces the burden of bronchiolitis but does not prevent infection. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants.  Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection.  Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions. Recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics to guide diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis. Palivizumab is effective in reducing RSV hospitalization in high risk patient groups.  .CONCLUSION: Palivizumab was effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalization infection in CF patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants 29 to 32 weeks' gestation without chronic illness, palivizumab use was associated with reduced RSV hospitalizations but increased hospitalizations for bronchiolitis without RSV diagnosis. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease. Eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis in a cohort of children with severe bronchiolitis. n 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated their recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis for children who are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. To investigate the potential impact of the more restrictive 2014 criteria on the eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis, we applied the 2012 and 2014 AAP recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis to a multicenter cohort of 2207 US children hospitalized for bronchiolitis. The decrease was largely driven by the restriction of eligibility to preterm infants with gestational age<29 weeks. To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting. Preventing RSV bronchiolitis in vulnerable infants: the role of palivizumab. Palivizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV is the only agent licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk children. OBJECTIVES Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is the only existent immunoprophylaxis therapy for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants (up to 2Â years of age), particularly in those who meet high-risk criteria (preterm infants and/or those with bronchopulmonary or congenital heart disease). CONCLUSION Palivizumab provides cost-effective prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants. OBJECTIVE To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting.

5a7238d32dc08e987e000009	Which two cotransporters are inhibited by sotagliflozin?	The present study used molecular docking by Autodock4.2 using our "Click-By-Click"-protocol, Ligplot1.4.3 and "change in accessible surface area (ÎASA)-calculations" to investigate the binding of two investigational anti-diabetic drugs, Ertugliflozin and Sotagliflozin to an established target (SGLT2) and a research target (human brain AChE). SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/SGLT2 dual inhibitor) also have a mild or moderate intestinal and renal SGLT1 inhibitory effect because of their relatively weak selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Hydrogen-bonded structures and interaction energies in two forms of the SGLT-2 inhibitor sotagliflozin. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin, an oral inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2, in combination with insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Phase 2 studies with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagliflozin, which acts in the gut and the kidney, have demonstrated reductions in A1C, weight, and glucose variability without an increased incidence of hypoglycemia. Sotagliflozin may meet this need, because this compound lowers blood glucose through the insulin-independent mechanisms of inhibiting kidney SGLT2 and intestinal SGLT1.  AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors focus specifically on sotagliflozin (LX4211), the first-in-class dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. Despite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies.  Therefore, sotagliflozin (LX4211) has been developed as a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2.  Sotagliflozin, a Dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibitor, as Adjunct Therapy to Insulin in Type 1 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of dual sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin as adjunct therapy to insulin in type 1 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We treated 33 patients with sotagliflozin, an oral dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind trial assessing safety, insulin dose, glycemic control, and other metabolic parameters over 29 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunct to insulin, dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin improved glycemic control and the CGM profile with bolus insulin dose reduction, weight loss, and no increased hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes.

5e4163b848dab47f2600000f	List 3 human diseases caused by  viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.	: Previous controversy was generated over the hypothesis that a paramyxovirus such as measles Measles are a systemic infectious disease caused by a single stranded ribonucleic acid virus (measles virus) from the paramyxovirus family. Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus.  Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus which causes fatal encephalitis in up to 75% of infected humans.  Measles is caused by the paramyxovirus which spreads through airborne droplets Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the superfamily Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae. Many of these identified genes were also required for infection by two other NS RNA viruses, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus of the Arenaviridae family and human parainfluenza virus type 3 of the Paramyxoviridae family. Measles virus ( MeV) , a highly contagious member of the Paramyxoviridae family , causes measles in humans .  The human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) is a newly reported respiratory virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that has been associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children .  Two members of the morbillivirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae , canine distemper virus ( CDV ) and measles virus ( MV) , are well-known for their ability to cause a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS in their natural hosts , dogs and humans , respectively .  Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is the single most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children , yet no highly effective treatment or vaccine is available.  Human respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) , a member of the Paramyxoviridae family , is the most important viral agent of pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide.  Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) , an RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae , causes respiratory disease in humans .  Measles virus ( MV ) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and an important human pathogen causing strong immunosuppression in affected individuals and a considerable number of deaths worldwide.  Hendra ( HeV ) and Nipah ( NiV ) viruses ( genus Henipavirus ( HNV; family Paramyxoviridae ) are emerging zoonotic agents that can cause severe respiratory distress and acute encephalitis in humans .  Many of the common respiratory illnesses of infancy and childhood are caused by viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, in particular measles virus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI3). Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017.

Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics we have applied a combination of multiple in silico approaches - Z curve, the cell division cycle (cdc6) gene location and location of consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences for location of origin of replication Using features that have been previously experimentally verified in the alpha-Proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, the origin of DNA replication (ori) regions were identified in silico for Wolbachia strains and eleven other related bacteria belonging to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia genera. These features include DnaA-, CtrA- and IHF-binding sites as well as the flanking genes in C. crescentus. The sequences of the ori regions described here are only similar among closely related bacteria while fundamental characteristics like presence of DnaA and IHF binding sites as well as the boundary genes are more widely conserved. We propose a correlation measure and show that it is correctly able to predict the origin of replication in most of the bacterial genomes. When applied to Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast and Nicotiana tabacum plastid, this correlation based method is able to correctly predict the origin of replication whereas the generally used GC skew measure fails. DNA base composition asymmetry is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes. These analyses include finding the dnaA gene and its binding sites; making BLAST analyses of the intergenic sequences compared to related species; studying the gene order around the origin sequence; and studying the distribution of the genes encoded in the leading versus the lagging strand. DnaA binds a single DnaA box as a monomer In silico comparative analysis of sequenced mollicute genomes indicated the lack of conservation of gene order in the region containing the predicted origin of replication (oriC) and the existence, in most of the mollicute genomes examined, of putative DnaA boxes lying upstream and downstream from the dnaA gene. In this paper we have applied a combination of multiple in silico approaches - Z curve, the cell division cycle (cdc6) gene location and location of consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences for location of origin of replication in Thermococcus onnurineus, Thermococcus gammatolerans and other Themococcales and compared the results to that of the well-documented case of Pyrococcus abyssi. DNA base composition asymmetry is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes. It increases the prediction accuracy of the replication termini compared with previously documented methods based on genomic base composition. Using compositional skews such as the GC skew, replication origin and terminus can be predicted in silico by observing the shift points. Here, we summarize the recent advances of in silico prediction of oriCs in bacterial and archaeal genomes using the Z-curve based method DNA base composition asymmetry is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes Recent Advances in the Identification of Replication Origins Based on the Z-curve Method.

511a4d391159fa8212000003	Which are the plant DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase families?	The topologies of the trees were overall congruent: four monophyletic groups corresponding to the four plant C5-MTase families were clearly distinguished. In addition, sequence analyses of the plant C5-MTase target recognition domain sequences were performed and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed showing that there is good conservation among but not within the plant C5-MTase families. To determine the inheritance of DNA methyltransferase genes and their expression patterns we examined three major DNA methyltransferase families (MET1, CMT3 and DRM) from tobacco and the progenitor species. The comparative investigation of transcription levels of different genes of cytosine DNA methyltransferase family MET (MET1, MET2a, MET2b, MET3) and their methylation patterns shows that there may exist some mechanisms defending the most actively transcribed gene MET1 of this family from methylation mediated silencing. In contrast to DRM2 gene we could not find any adenine methylated GATC sites in the MET1 gene. Using the 1kb 3' terminal DNA fragment of the mouse methyltransferase cDNA as a probe and low stringent hybridisation conditions, a new potential methyltransferase (MTase) gene family was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA library. The Dnmt3 family of de novo DNA methyltransferases has recently been characterized in animals. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. These results provide the first direct demonstration that DNA-METases of a higher eukaryote are encoded by a gene family. Here we show that Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase2 (AtDNMT2) is localized in nucleus and associates with histone deacetylation. To explore possible relationships between DNA methylation level and accumulation of DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase (DNMT) transcripts, the full-length coding sequences corresponding to three different DNMT families in oil palm, namely the MET, CMT, and DRM classes, have been isolated and characterized. In Arabidopsis a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling factor-related protein DDM1 and a cytosine methyltransferase MET1 are required for maintenance of genomic cytosine methylation. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. In the present study, the isolation and characterization of two distinct cDNAs that code for carrot DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNA-METase) are reported. The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytosine-5 methyltransferases and shows 50% homology to the murine enzyme in the methyltransferase domain. As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases.	[['MET'], ['CMT'], ['DRM']]
5149a61ed24251bc05000044	What are the computational methods for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins?	BETAWARE: a machine-learning tool to detect and predict transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in prokaryotes Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. Here, we present our BETAWARE program that includes both approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux-based computer to easily address in-home massive protein annotation or filtering. We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane Î²-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods. This ab initio model resolves the protein folding problem based on pseudo-energy minimization with the aid of a simple probabilistic filter. It also allows for determining structures whose barrel follows a given permutation on the arrangement of Î²-strands, and allows for rapidly discriminating the transmembrane Î²-barrels from other kinds of proteins. BOCTOPUS: improved topology prediction of transmembrane Î² barrel proteins Improving the detection of transmembrane Î²-barrel chains with N-to-1 extreme learning machines we introduce a new machine learning approach for TMBB detection based on N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machines TMBHMM: a frequency profile based HMM for predicting the topology of transmembrane beta barrel proteins and the exposure status of transmembrane residues We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. Prediction of the exposure status of transmembrane beta barrel residues from protein sequence We present BTMX (Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure), a computational method to predict the exposure status (i.e. exposed to the bilayer or hidden in the protein structure) of transmembrane residues in transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs). Combined prediction of transmembrane topology and signal peptide of beta-barrel proteins: using a hidden Markov model and genetic algorithms We present here, an HMM that combine a transmembrane barrel submodel and an SP submodel for both topology and SP predictions. A new genetic algorithm (GA) is presented here to training the model, at the same time the Posterior-Viterbi algorithm is adopted for decoding. In this work, we propose a method based on radial basis networks for predicting the number of beta-strands in OMPs and identifying their membrane spanning segments. We have developed a web server, TMBETAPRED-RBF for predicting the transmembrane beta-strands from amino acid sequence and it is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/tmrbf.html We have developed a novel approach for dissecting transmembrane beta-barrel proteins (TMBs) in genomic sequences. The features include (i) the identification of TMBs using the preference of residue pairs in globular, transmembrane helical (TMH) and TMBs, (ii) elimination of globular/TMH proteins that show sequence identity of more than 70% for the coverage of 80% residues with known structures, (iii) elimination of globular/TMH proteins that have sequence identity of more than 60% with known sequences in SWISS-PROT, and (iv) exclusion of TMH proteins using SOSUI, a prediction system for TMH proteins. TMBpro: secondary structure, beta-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for discriminating TMB and non-TMB proteins. In this paper, based on the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAA) that can incorporate sequence-order information of a protein sequence so as to remarkably enhance the power of discrete models (Chou, K. C., Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43: 246-255), cellular automata and Lempel-Ziv complexity are introduced to predict the TM regions of integral membrane proteins including both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins, validated by jackknife test we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. PRED-TMBB: a web server for predicting the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins We present here a web server (PRED-TMBB, http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB) which is capable of predicting the transmembrane strands and the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. The method is based on a Hidden Markov Model, trained according to the Conditional Maximum Likelihood criterion. Prediction of transmembrane regions of beta-barrel proteins using ANN- and SVM-based methods his article describes a method developed for predicting transmembrane beta-barrel regions in membrane proteins using machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The ANN used in this study is a feed-forward neural network with a standard back-propagation training algorithm. We have also developed an SVM-based method using a primary sequence as input and achieved an accuracy of 77.4%. The SVM model was modified by adding 36 physicochemical parameters to the amino acid sequence information. Finally, ANN- and SVM-based methods were combined to utilize the full potential of both techniques. we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane beta-barrel regions in proteins Predicting transmembrane beta-barrels in proteomes Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs. All proteome predictions and the PROFtmb prediction method are available The beta-barrel finder (BBF) program, allowing identification of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins encoded within prokaryotic genomes We here report computational analyses of six outer membrane proteins of known 3D structures with respect to (1) secondary structure, (2) hydropathy, and (3) amphipathicity. Using these characteristics, as well as the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence, a program was developed allowing prediction of integral membrane beta-barrel proteins encoded within any completely sequenced prokaryotic genome. This program, termed the beta-barrel finder (BBF) program, was used to analyze the proteins encoded within the Escherichia coli genome. A sequence-profile-based HMM for predicting and discriminating beta barrel membrane proteins We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. The model is cyclic with 6 types of states: two for the beta strand transmembrane core, one for the beta strand cap on either side of the membrane, one for the inner loop, one for the outer loop and one for the globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The development of a specific input for HMM based on multiple sequence alignment is novel. Prediction of the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins with a neural network-based predictor A method based on neural networks is trained and tested on a nonredundant set of beta-barrel membrane proteins known at atomic resolution with a jackknife procedure. The method predicts the topography of transmembrane beta strands with residue accuracy as high as 78% when evolutionary information is used as input to the network. A web server based on the proposed method is available at http://yanbioinformatics.cs.usu.edu:8080/TMBKNNsubmit. Predicting three-dimensional structures of transmembrane domains of Î²-barrel membrane proteins We have developed a computational method for predicting structures of the transmembrane (TM) domains of Î²-barrel membrane proteins. Based on physical principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of Î²-barrel membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as a model to account for interstrand loop entropy. exposure status classification of transmembrane beta barrel residues Several computational methods exist for the identification of transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) from sequence. Some of these methods also provide the transmembrane (TM) boundaries of the putative TMBs. The aim of this study is to (1) derive the propensities of the TM residues to be exposed to the lipid bilayer and (2) to predict the exposure status (i.e. exposed to the bilayer or hidden in protein structure) of TMB residues. The modified Mahalanobis Discriminant for predicting outer membrane proteins by using Chou's pseudo amino acid composition. In this study, a method that combines increment of diversity with modified Mahalanobis Discriminant, called IDQD, is presented to predict 208 OMPs, 206 transmembrane helical proteins (TMHPs) and 673 globular proteins (GPs) by using Chou's pseudo amino acid compositions as parameters. Predicting transmembrane beta-barrels and interstrand residue interactions from sequence A novel method using pairwise interstrand residue statistical potentials derived from globular (nonouter membrane) proteins is introduced to predict the supersecondary structure of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure. Predicting the solvent accessibility of transmembrane residues from protein sequence In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the solvent accessible surface areas of transmembrane residues. For both transmembrane alpha-helix and beta-barrel residues, the correlation coefficients between the predicted and observed accessible surface areas are around 0.65. BOMP: a program to predict integral beta-barrel outer membrane proteins encoded within genomes of Gram-negative bacteria This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands. A HMM-based method to predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins A novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with architecture obeying those proteins' construction principles. First, an algorithm that calculates the mean hydrophobicity of one side of putative beta-strands predicted the positions of 16 transmembrane segments, a structure common to known porins. Second, outer loops typical of porins were assigned using an artificial neural network trained to predict the topology of bacterial outer-membrane proteins with a predominance of beta-strands Prediction of the membrane-spanning beta-strands of the major outer membrane protein of Chlamydia Topology prediction of Brucella abortus Omp2b and Omp2a porins after critical assessment of transmembrane beta strands prediction by several secondary structure prediction methods Four porins of known structure were selected as test-cases and their secondary structure delineated. The specificity and sensitivity of 11 methods were separately evaluated. Our critical assessment shows that some secondary structure prediction methods (PHD, Dsc, Sopma) originally designed to predict globular protein structure are useful on porin topology prediction. The overall best prediction is obtained by combining these three "generalist" methods with a transmembrane beta strand prediction technique A knowledge-based potential highlights unique features of membrane Î±-helical and Î²-barrel protein insertion and folding In previous work, a depth-dependent insertion potential, E(z) , was derived for Î±-helical inner membrane proteins. We have generated an equivalent potential for TM Î²-barrel proteins. The similarities and differences between these two potentials provide insight into unique aspects of the folding and insertion of Î²-barrel membrane proteins. This potential can predict orientation within the membrane and identify functional residues involved in intermolecular interactions. Improved identification of outer membrane beta barrel proteins using primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, and evolutionary information We present an accurate sequence-based predictor of OMBBs, called OMBBpred, which utilizes a Support Vector Machine classifier and a custom-designed set of 34 novel numerical descriptors derived from predicted secondary structures, hydrophobicity, and evolutionary information. Predicting weakly stable regions, oligomerization state, and protein-protein interfaces in transmembrane domains of outer membrane proteins. We have also discovered that out-clamps, in-plugs, and oligomerization are 3 general mechanisms for stabilizing weakly stable TM regions. In addition, we have found that extended and contiguous weakly stable regions often signal the existence of an oligomer and that strands located in the interfaces of protein-protein interactions are considerably less stable. Based on these observations, we can predict oligomerization states and can identify the interfaces of protein-protein interactions for beta-barrel membrane proteins by using either structure or sequence information Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane Î²-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods. Several computational methods have been developed to discriminate TMBBs from other types of proteins. To conquer this limitation, we developed a new computational model that can be used for predicting the ASA of both TM Î±-helix and Î²-barrel residues. Transmembrane beta barrel (TMB) proteins are found in the outer membranes of bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. RESULTS: We present here, an HMM that combine a transmembrane barrel submodel and an SP submodel for both topology and SP predictions. Prediction of membrane spanning segments in beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) and their topology is an important problem in structural and functional genomics. In the simplest of these, the target "model" is another protein sequence, while the more elaborate methods group together the entire set of t ansmembrane helical or transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. Based on this study, we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane beta-barrel regions in proteins (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred).

5524562387ecba3764000001	Which are the different homologs or family members of the hedgehog proteins in mammals?	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals.  We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC. Previous work has shown that activin, a TGF(beta+) signaling molecule, permits pancreas development by repressing expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules that antagonize pancreas development. Here we show that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another hedgehog family member, and Patched 1 (Ptc1), a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity, are expressed in pancreatic tissue. The original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh).  Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule of the hedgehog family known to play important roles in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, cortical bone formation, and the development of joints. Hedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) bind to Patched family receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2) to transduce signals to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. GLI family transcription factors then activate transcription of Hedgehog target genes, such as FOXE1 and FOXM1 encoding Forkhead-box transcription factors. Indian hedgehog (IHH) and its receptors patched (PTC) and smoothened (SMO) belong to the hedgehog family of signaling molecules, which are essential for a variety of patterning events during mammalian tIssue development. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).

5e2f906ffbd6abf43b00002c	Which drugs are included in GI cocktail?	AIM: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to locate and evaluate clinical trials comparing the use of an oral gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (oral viscous lidocaine/ antacid Â± anticholinergic) to standard diagnostic protocols (serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), serial biomarkers, imaging and/ or provocative testing) to differentiate emergency patients presenting with acute chest pain caused by gastro-oesophageal disease from those with other aetiologies. Despite the traditional "GI cocktail" (GI indicates gastrointestinal), an intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a novel acid-lowering drug, has recently been used to treat this condition.  Selected patients with severe dyspeptic pain were randomized to treatment with a placebo, antacid, and antispasmodic (conventional group) or IV pantoprazole, antacid, and antispasmodic (pantoprazole group). This was a prospective randomized, single-blinded comparison between Benzocaine and Lidocaine as the topical anesthetic in a gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail. Patients were randomized to equivalent doses of either Benzocaine or viscous Lidocaine in addition to 30 cc of Maalox and 10 cc of Donnatal.  This study compared three combinations commonly given for dyspepsia. The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial comparing antacid (group 1); antacid + Donnatal (group 2); antacid + Donnatal + viscous lidocaine (group 3) for acute treatment of dyspepsia in the ED.  STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine practice patterns regarding administration of the "GI cocktail" (a mixture of liquid antacid, viscous lidocaine, and an anticholinergic) in the emergency department in a single hospital and the responses and final dispositions of patients who received the cocktails. Patients presenting to the ED with dyspeptic symptoms were randomized to receive 30 mL of antacid (Mylanta II), or 30 mL of antacid plus 15 mL of 2% viscous lidocaine (GI cocktail).

53357c98d6d3ac6a3400004a	What genes are related to breast cancer?	Network analysis showed increased expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways were also highly expressed These results indicate that nuclear NRF2 protein plays important roles in the proliferation and/or progression of breast carcinoma, and nuclear NRF2 immunoreactivity is therefore considered a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients Our previous studies in breast cancer cells indicate that 2CdA and F-ara-A are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription  It seems to be a new important element of ClF anticancer activity and may indicate its potential efficacy in epigenetic therapy of solid tumours, especially at early stages of carcinogenesis many molecular components that regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key recombinase in HR  Our findings suggest a rigorous p53-mediated regulation on hRAD51 functions in HR even in the presence of BRCA2 coordinated replication and transcription of pericentromeric repeats enable RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated transmission of pericentromeric heterochromatin in fission yeast, which is essential for the proper function of centromeres. Rad3/ATR kinase phosphorylates histone H2A on serine-128/-129 to create Î³H2A in pericentromeric heterochromatin during S phase, which recruits Brc1 through its breast cancer gene 1 protein (BRCA1) C-terminal (BRCT) domains protein BRCA2 affect its interactions with the recombinase RAD51 and are associated with an increased risk of cancer  serial deletion mutation experiments, binding strengths were increased when the C-terminal BRC repeat was removed from BRC1-8, BRC1-5 and BRC1-3. These results may provide an insight into the effects of missense or truncation mutations in BRCA2 in canine tumours. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses. Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts Genetic BRCA2 insufficiency is associated with breast cancer development; however, in sporadic breast cancer cases, high BRCA2 expression is paradoxically correlated with poor prognosis HER-2 and TOP2A gene amplification showed a tendency to be associated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, high level of apoptotic and proliferative indexes, and low level of p53 and Bcl-2 expression, which all together indicate group of patients with similar outcome during the progression of the disease	[['p53', 'TP53'], ['BRCA2'], ['NRF2'], ['BRCA1'], ['BRCT'], ['HER2', 'ERBB2', 'RPS2'], ['TOP2A'], ['TRIM22']]
533c384dc45e133714000006	In which genomic positions is the histone variant macroH2A enriched?	Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A1, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin This repressor activity is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold mH2A1 consistently colocalizes with a heterochromatin marker (H3K27me2; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27) and mH2A2 with a euchromatin marker (H3K4me3; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4) Similar results were found for the L41gene, with enrichment of mH2A in the promoter region. By using highly specific antibodies against mH2A1 and stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mH2A1 or GFP-H2A, we found that the Xi chromosome contains approximately 1.5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome. Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes. macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing. We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies. These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB) In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome. Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2 before reforming in late G1, macroH2A1 remains associated during mitosis with specific regions of the Xi, including at the X inactivation center	[['Repressed regions'], ['Inactive X chromosome'], ['Centromeres']]

52d2818403868f1b06000033	Which are the newly identified DNA nucleases that can be used to treat thalassemia?	Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) DNA editing technology enables site-directed engineering of the genome We used this opportunity to evaluate the effect of total donor homology on transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) mediated bi-allelic modification.  Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. In this study, we used zinc finger nuclease-mediated knockout of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) in MCF7 and AHR knockout in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to investigate cross talk among AHR, ARNT, and estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±).  For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA.  Genome editing using engineered nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) has become a powerful technology for reverse genetics Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free Î²-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We report here the correction of Î±-thalassemia major hydrops fetalis in transgene-free iPS cells using zinc finger-mediated insertion of a globin transgene in the AAVS1 site on human chromosome 19.   Here, we review the development of Cas9 as an important tool to not only edit the genomes of a number of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, but also as an efficient system for site-specific transcriptional repression or activation. Additionally, a specific Cas9 protein has been observed to target an RNA substrate, suggesting that Cas9 may have the ability to be programmed to target RNA as well. RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms.  The CRISPR/Cas technology has been successfully used to stimulate the integration of small DNA sequences in a target locus to produce gene mutations.

56c6dc6f5795f9a73e000007	Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin?	We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing ("ChIP-seq") of DNA associated with the centromere-specific histone H3, CENP-A (CenH3), to identify centromeric DNA, and ChIP-seq with antibodies against dimethylated H3K4, trimethylated H3K9 and trimethylated H3K27 to determine the relative distribution and proportion of euchromatin, obligate and facultative heterochromatin, respectively Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin. In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. Remarkably, H3K9me3 is predominant in coding regions of active genes, a phenomenon that is not restricted to the X chromosome. We detected the H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 modifications, with H3K27me3, which is indicative of facultative heterochromatin, exhibiting the highest enrichment on all viral promoters tested.  Our study identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells.

52f112bb2059c6d71c000002	Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA?	In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5'-phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II (polymerase II) during the early stages of transcription. We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein). RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability. Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5' phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase). The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT. Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript. Myc induces methyl cap formation by promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation which recruits the capping enzymes to RNA, and by up-regulating the enzyme SAHH (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase), which neutralizes the inhibitory by-product of methylation reactions. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The methylation of the 5' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R. K. Cross and P. J. Gomatos, Virology, 114, 542-554, 1981). The enzyme responsible for this methylation, a guanine-7-methyltransferase, is associated with the SFV replication complex An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells.

Yamanaka et al. described two case studies involving coexistent cholelithiasis, hiatal hernia, and umbilical hernias, and discussed clinical similarities with the classical features of the Saint's triad.  Umbilical hernia with cholelithiasis and hiatal hernia: a clinical entity similar to Saint's triad. We experienced two cases involving the simultaneous presence of cholelithiasis, hiatal hernia, and umbilical hernia. Both patients were female and overweight (body mass index of 25.0-29.9Â kg/m(2)) and had a history of pregnancy and surgical treatment of cholelithiasis. Additionally, both patients had two of the three conditions of Saint's triad. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced.  Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae.  BACKGROUND: Sixty years ago, Saint's triad (hiatus hernia, diverticulosis of the colon, and gallbladder disease) was first described in three patients. In connection with two cases authors review our current body of knowledge on Saint's triad that means the concomitant occurrence of cholelithiasis, hiatus hernia and colonic diverticulosis. The investigation revealed 7 cases of Saint's triad (1.02%) and 86 cases of bifocal associations; 59 cholelithiasis + diverticulosis, 17 cholelithiasis + Hiatus hernia; 10 diverticulosis + hernia. The morphologic changes are described found in the gallbladder of a female patient, aged 40; she had xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis secondary to cholelithiasis combined with a hiatal hernia and multiple duodenal diverticulae (Saint's triad). A quarter of a century ago Professor C. F. M. Saint of the University of Cape Town noted the occasional association of diverticular disease, hiatus hernia, and gallstones in a patient. Authors stress that in the event of simultaneous symptoms suggestive of atypic cholelithiasis , colonic diverticulosis and hiatus hernia one has to consider a potential Saint 's triad In connection with two cases authors review our current body of knowledge on Saint 's triad that means the concomitant occurrence of cholelithiasis , hiatus hernia and colonic diverticulosis In 1948 , Saint 's Triad , an aggregation of hiatus hernia ( later , any primary hernia) , gallstones , and diverticulosis coli , was introduced CONCLUSIONS Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad.

514a11add24251bc05000054	Which diseases can Oncotype DX be used for?	Prognostic and predictive markers Oncotype DXÂ® currently allow avoidance of an over therapy or under therapy a high score on the Oncotype DX gene expression profile r poor-prognosis ER-positive breast cancers in need of more aggressive therapy luminal B class The 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX: RS) appears to augment clinico-pathologic prognostication and is predictive of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+), endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. Half of all breast cancers are early stage, lymph node negative, and hormone receptor positive. A 21-gene (Oncotype DXÂ®; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) recurrence score (RS) is prognostic for recurrence and predictive of chemotherapy benefit. We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes. Molecular tests such as the Oncotype DX(Â®) breast cancer test are proving to be more effective tools for individualized patient stratification and treatment planning than traditional methods such as patient demographic variables and histopathology indicators. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy. The oncotype DXÂ® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and treatment decisions. The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer. The 21-gene signature has been intensively studied and incorporated into major guidelines for treatment decision in early breast cancer. Among early-stage breast cancer patients who received Oncotype DX, we found low knowledge about many aspects of genomic recurrence risk testing. the gene expression signatures that define specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets, such as luminal A and B, basal, normal-like, and ERBB2+, and prognostic signatures including MammaPrint and Oncotype DX, predicted genomic instability in our samples. This remarkable congruence suggests a biological interdependence of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome. The Oncotype DX assay is one of the molecular tests that provide predictive and prognostic information to breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and node-negative disease. This study evaluates the association of Forkhead-box protein A1 (FOXA1) and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) expressions with Oncotype DX recurrences scores in 77 cases of patients with ER-positive node-negative breast carcinomas diagnosed at Indiana University. the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond to chemotherapy. The EWG found adequate evidence regarding the association of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with disease recurrence and adequate evidence for response to chemotherapy. EWG) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer. confirmed the clinical validity of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay, not only as a way to predict recurrence but also as a tool for determining therapeutic benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Over several decades, investigators working through National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cooperative Groups have contributed to major advances in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer. Cooperative Group studies have contributed to the development of a molecular profiling test, Oncotype Dx, which identifies women who have an excellent prognosis with hormonal therapy alone. In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. 78 women, treated for early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with 0-3 positive lymph nodes, whose medical records indicated they received Oncotype DX testing earlier. A retrospective chart review of 58 T1/T2, node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer patients that underwent Oncotype DX gene assay testing between January and December 2006 was performed.

5aa13fd3d6d6b54f79000003	List 4 drugs used to treat opioid addiction or overdose	Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine/naloxone in the treatment of prenatal opioid abuse. PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment. Methadone is an opioid prescribed for pain management and is also provided through opioid treatment programs to treat opioid use disorders. Fortunately, there are effective medications (ie, methadone, buprenorphine, and oral and injectable naltrexone) available for the treatment of opioid addiction.

5e52c1fd6d0a27794100004c	List types of cancer where TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16) is involved	Expression of TBC1D16 Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy with high recurrence and poor prognosis duo to the lack of effective biomarkers. TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16), a GTPase-activating protein, is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of TBC1D16 in EOC remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression and prognostic significance of TBC1D16 in EOC and its relationship with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The tissue specimens included 156 histologically confirmed EOC and 30 normal ovarian tissues. The expression of TBC1D16 and VEGF was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the immunoreactive score was calculated with signal intensity and percentage of positive cells. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as "high expression," compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). The Chi-square test showed that high TBC1D16 expression was related to advanced pT stages (P = 0.029), but not correlated with other clinical features. Moreover, the TBC1D16 expression was significantly higher in EOC specimens with low VEGF expression (P < 0.001). Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, high expression of TBC1D16 was significantly correlated with good overall survival (OS). In conclusion, TBC1D16 is a predictive marker for favorable prognosis of EOC. Epigenetic activation of a cryptic TBC1D16 transcript enhances melanoma progression by targeting EGFR. Metastasis is responsible for most cancer-related deaths, and, among common tumor types, melanoma is one with great potential to metastasize. Here we study the contribution of epigenetic changes to the dissemination process by analyzing the changes that occur at the DNA methylation level between primary cancer cells and metastases. We found a hypomethylation event that reactivates a cryptic transcript of the Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D16 (TBC1D16-47 kDa; referred to hereafter as TBC1D16-47KD) to be a characteristic feature of the metastatic cascade. This short isoform of TBC1D16 exacerbates melanoma growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. By combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified RAB5C as a new TBC1D16 target and showed that it regulates EGFR in melanoma cells. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as "high expression," compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). Expression of TBC1D16 Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer . Based on the immunoreactive score , TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as " high expression , " compared with normal ovarian tissues ( P < 0.05) .  In addition, hypomethylation of TBC1D16 was observed in multiple tumours, including a breast cancer primary/metastasis pair, and to a lesser degree in melanoma, although again not all tumours or cancer primary/metastasis pairs exhibited altered patterns of methylation. BACKGROUND Characteristic DNA methylation differences have been identified between primary and metastatic melanomas at EBF3 and/or TBC1D16 gene loci. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

Treatment with purine analogs and the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and increased survival. Nelarabine is an effective regimen against indolent leukemias, and combining it with fludarabine was most promising. Determination of tumor cell ara-GTP levels may provide a predictive test for response to nelarabine. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia has an aggressive course with short median survival and poor response to chemotherapy. With the use of the purine analogue pentostatin more than half of patients will have a major response and a minority will have a complete remission, usually lasting months.  T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare post-thymic T-cell malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. It has generally been resistant to alkylating chemotherapy, but some effect has been observed with the purine analog 2-deoxycoformicin with documented partial or complete response rates in up to 45% of patients. Fifteen patients with T-PLL, most of whom had received the purine analog deoxycoformycin (DCF), were treated with CAMPATH-1H. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.

58a94483ee23e0236b000003	Which fimA genotypes are associated with disease?	 FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease)  Long fimbriae (FimA) are important virulence factors of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Based on the diversity of the fimA gene, this species is classified into 6 genotypes.   In cases of chronic apical periodontitis, P. gingivalis variant type IV was the most prevalent (24%), followed by types I (20%), II (16%), and III (8%). In acute abscess samples, variant type II was the most prevalent (12%), followed by types III and IV (8% of each) and type I (4%). We show that P. gingivalis strains with genotype I and II of FimA are efficient in interaction with saliva or S. gordonii.  A strong association between Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib and chronic periodontitis exists in the Spanish population. The most prevalent genotype in periodontal patients is II. Our results suggest that the presence of P. gingivalis is associated with periodontal diseases, and that the type II, IV and Ib/II combination are the most common among fimA genotypes. Statistical analysis, however, revealed that a more significant correlation was found between periodontitis and the occurrence of type Ib fimA.  Type II of fimA was the most prevalent genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP.  The population of Tregs further decreased in patients with type II FimA compared with the other types. P.gingivlias FimA genotype II was the dominant type associated with decreased Treg population.  A trend toward a greater frequency of FimA II genotype in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis was determined. The fimA type Ib genotype of P. gingivalis was found to play a critical role in the destruction of peri-implant tissue, suggesting that it may be a distinct risk factor for peri-implantitis.

5e493a3e6d0a277941000002	Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?	As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2, while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the adipogenesis defect observed in these cells.

588f952994c1512c50000007	What are clinical features of the de Morsier syndrome?	 SOD was formerly known as de Morsier syndrome, which associated a midline brain defect such as an absent septum pellucidum with optic nerve hypoplasia. The triad consists of optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and midline brain defects, although it can vary in the severity of clinical presentation and phenotype.  INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have described septooptic dysplasia (SOD) to describe patients who have optic nerve hypoplasia, the absence of septum pellucidum, and pituitary hypoplasia. BACKGROUND: Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.  Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), otherwise called De Morsier syndrome, is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities).  The frequently associated features of hypopituitarism and absent septum pellucidum were felt to have embryonic linkage as "septo-optic dysplasia" or "de Morsier's syndrome." An MRI of the brain demonstrated the absence of the septum pellucidum, which confirmed a diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia or de Morsier syndrome. Septo-optic dysplasia (De Morsier syndrome) is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities. Septo-optic dysplasia, also known as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital entity almost always characterized by hypoplasia/dysplasia of the optical nerve, chiasma or optic radiations and the complete or partial absence of the septum pellucidum. The de Morsier syndrome, or septo-optic dysplasia, is a developmental anomaly characterized by involvement of the optic system, hypothalamic-pituitary axis and septum pellucidum. The term septooptic dysplasia was coined in 1956 by de Morsier, who pointed out the association of optic nerve hypoplasia and absence of the septum pellucidum. Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.

5a76196faacfb9cd4c000001	List the two most important hematological features of the Evans syndrome	Evans syndrome (ES) was defined by the combination of immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count<100,000/mm3) and AIHA. Thrombocytopenia was only found in this cluster (36% of cases, manifested as Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) or Evans syndrome). BACKGROUND: Autoimmune cytopenias are characterized by immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic cell lines with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) affecting platelets and Evans syndrome (ES) affecting platelets and red blood cells.  Primary Evans syndrome (ES) is defined by the concurrent or sequential occurrence of immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the absence of an underlying etiology.  Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare autoimmune disorder, which is characterized by immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. BACKGROUND: Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare immune disorder in children, manifested by simultaneous or sequential autoimmune cytopenias (ACs) of unknown cause and having a chronic course with periods of exacerbation and remission.  Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare autoimmune disorder whose exact pathophysiology is unknown. It is characterized by the simultaneous or subsequent development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).  Evans' syndrome is an unusual illness of autoimmune etiology, characterized by thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Evans syndrome is an uncommon condition characterised by simultaneous or sequential development of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) in the absence of a known underlying aetiology. Evans' syndrome is an uncommon condition defined by the combination (either simultaneously or sequentially) of immune thrombocytopenia purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a positive direct antiglobulin test in the absence of known underlying etiology. Evans syndrome is a very rare hematologic autoimmune disease, characterized by a direct Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura without a known underlying etiology. Evans syndrome usually is complicated by hemolytic or thrombocytopenic symptoms. The selection criteria were Evans' syndrome in pregnancy; autoimmune haemolytic anaemia; immune thrombocytopenia. Evans' syndrome is an unusual illness of autoimmune etiology, characterized by thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Evans syndrome refers to a hematological autoimmune disorder with autoimmune hemolytic anemia accompanied by immune thrombocytopenia. Evans syndrome is a very rare hematologic autoimmune disease, characterized by a direct Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura without a known underlying etiology.

5156be75d24251bc05000088	Which diseases is microRNA 132 (miR-132) implicated in?	Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNA are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy. Inflammation, stress signalling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes a chronic immuno-inflammatory response in the eye that may result in corneal neovascularization during blinding immunopathological lesion stromal keratitis (SK). miR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that is induced in endothelial cells in response to growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17. The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease. Manipulating miRNA expression holds promise as a therapeutic approach to control an ocular lesion that is an important cause of human blindness. Role of miR-132 in angiogenesis The cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identified 26 genes up-regulated in schizophrenia subjects. Our data suggest miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments. Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain.

515df86a298dcd4e5100002e	List co-morbidities that may occur together with "Stiff man Syndrome"	To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves' disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature. This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves' disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with immunosuppressive therapy. HCV may be the etiologic virus of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity; a rare disorder similar to stiff-man syndrome although different because it is progressive and fatal. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS. GAD has been suggested as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). GAD-65 is a dominant autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An elderly man with progressive dementia and concomitant development of stiff-man syndrome is described. He had not had stiff-man syndrome one year earlier, when he had only mild dementia. An association between stiff-man syndrome and dementia has not been previously described. It is possible that this patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia.

5c6b7daa7c78d6947100002b	List major features of TEMPI Syndrome.	TEMPI Syndrome: Erythrocytosis in Plasma Cell Dyscrasia. TEMPI (telangiectasias, erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric fluid collections, intrapulmonary shunting) syndrome is a newly described clinical entity that is generally considered a plasma cell dyscrasia with multiple system involvement.  In other MGCS, such as scleromyxedema, Clarkson syndrome, TEMPI syndrome, cutis laxa and the neutrophilic dermatoses, the link between the monoclocal component and the entity is clearly established, but not understood so far. TEMPI syndrome (telangiectasias, elevated erythropoietin level and erythrocytosis, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric fluid collections, and intrapulmonary shunting) is a recently described syndrome that, owing to erythrocytosis, may be confused with polycythemia vera. In conclusion, TEMPI syndrome should be considered when erythrocytosis and plasma cell dyscrasia coexist. BACKGROUND The TEMPI syndrome was recently described in 2011, and is characterized by the constellation of five hallmarks: Telangiectasias, Erythrocytosis and elevated Erythropoietin, Monoclonal gammopathy, Perinephric fluids collections, and Intrapulmonary shunting.

55439140ed966d112c00000a	Which are the major phycobiliproteins present in cyanobacteria?	An extensive range of pigments including phycobiliproteins are present in algae. C-phycocyanin (C-PC), a phycobiliprotein, is one of the key pigments of Spirulina Spirulina platensis produces nutraceutical product C-phycocyanin (C-PC) C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc) is one of the major biliprotein pigments of unicellular cyanbacterium of Spirulina platenesis Marine Synechococcus owe their specific vivid color (ranging from blue-green to orange) to their large extrinsic antenna complexes called phycobilisomes, comprising a central allophycocyanin core and rods of variable phycobiliprotein composition. Three major pigment types can be defined depending on the major phycobiliprotein found in the rods (phycocyanin, phycoerythrin I or phycoerythrin II) Phycocyanin--a major phycobiliprotein constitutively produced by many cyanobacteria-- R-phycoerythrin was isolated and purified from a red alga, Polysiphonia urceolata Grev C-phycocyanin (C-PC), one of the major phycobiliproteins of Spirulina platensis (a blue-green alga) C-Phycocyanin (C-PC), the major light harvesting biliprotein from Spirulina platensis is of greater importance because of its various biological and pharmacological properties. B-Phycoerythrin (B-PE) is a major light-harvesting pigment of microalgae. Phycoerythrin is a major light-harvesting pigment of red algae and cyanobacteria that is widely used as a fluorescent probe and analytical reagent. In this paper, B-phycoerythrin and R-phycocyanin in native state, from the red alga Porphyridium cruentum were obtained by an inexpensive and simple process. Phycobiliproteins are derived from the photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. the three major phycobiliprotein types, namely allophycocyanin, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin Phycoerythrin is a major light-harvesting pigment of red algae and cyanobacteria widely used as a fluorescent probe. allophycocyanin (APC) R-phycoerythrin is the major light-harvesting pigment protein of most red algal phycobilisomes. The purified protein had three absorption peaks at 498, 535, and 565 nm and displayed a fluorescence maximum at 580 nm, which was consistent with the typical spectrum of R-phycoerythrin. The purified R-PE was also identified with electrophoresis. Phycobilisomes, the major light-harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria are multimolecular structures made up of chromophoric proteins called phycobiliproteins and non chromophoric linker polypeptides. We report here the isolation and nucleotide sequence of the genes, cpeA and cpeB, which in Calothrix PCC 7601 encode the alpha and beta subunits of phycoerythrin, one of the major phycobiliproteins. The major light-harvesting complex in eukaryotic red algae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria is the phycobilisome, a water-soluble complex located on the outer surface of the photosynthetic membranes and composed of both pigmented phycobiliproteins (85%) and non-pigmented linker (15%) polypeptides. Phycocyanin is a major protein produced by cyanobacteria, but very few phycocyanin-producing strains have been reported.

52f509232059c6d71c00001f	Which genes are implicated in short QT syndrome?	A novel gain-of-function KCNJ2 mutation associated with short-QT syndrome impairs inward rectification of Kir2.1 currents. In this study, we identified a novel KCNJ2 gain-of-function mutation, M301K, associated with SQTS.  A mutation in genes related to SQTS was found in 23% of the probands; most of them had a gain of function mutation in HERG (SQTS1). We present, for the first time, a novel loss-of-function mutation coding for an L-type calcium channel subunit.  however, a new variant at a heterozygous state was identified in the CACNA2D1 gene (nucleotide c.2264G > C; amino acid p.Ser755Thr), coding for the Ca(v)Î±(2)Î´-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel. In the present study, we report the first pathogenic mutation in the CACNA2D1 gene in humans, which causes a new variant of SQTS. A novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene associated with short QT syndrome. The altered function of T618I-HERG channels suggests that this mutation in the KCNH2 gene is responsible for the SQTS phenotype in this family.  Gain of function mutations in three genes encoding K(+) channels have been identified, explaining the abbreviated repolarization seen in this condition: KCNH2 for I(kr) (SQT1), KCNQ1 for I(ks) (SQT2) and KCNJ2 for I(k1) (SQT3).  To evaluate the possible diagnosis of SQTS, DNA sequencing of genes known to be associated with SQTS was performed and identified a novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene. The mutation of genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) encoding for cardiac potassium channels plays a central role in SQTS.  To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome.  Mutations in 3 different genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and KCNJ2, all encoding cardiac ionic potassium channels have been identified in affected patients.  Genetic analysis has, to date, identified three distinct forms of the condition, involving gain-of-function mutations to three different cardiac potassium channel genes: KCNH2 (SQT1), KCNQ1 (SQT2) and KCNJ2 (SQT3).  Three different gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding for cardiac potassium channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified up to now to cause short QT syndrome.

56ddbbaf51531f7e33000009	Which histone modifications distinguish between promoters and enhancers?	Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure genome-wide changes in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a marker of active enhancers, in unstimulated HUVECs and HUVECs stimulated with VEGFA for 1, 4, and 12 h. Here we use whole-transcriptome analysis coupled with genome-wide profiling of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 to map chromatin states and enhancers in mouse embryonic forelimb and hindlimb. Using H3K27ac profiles, we identified 28,377 putative enhancers, many of which are likely to be limb specific based on strong enrichment near genes highly expressed in the limb and comparisons with tissue-specific EP300 sites and known enhancers.  a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of H3K27ac marking, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong depletion of H3K27me3 We also find that some developmental enhancers exhibit components of this signature, including hypersensitivity, H3K27ac enrichment, and H3K27me3 depletion, at lower levels in tissues in which they are not active. At some locations, H3K27 monomethylation was also found to be associated with chromatin signatures of gene enhancers. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers.  We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.  Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.	[['H3K27ac enrichment'], ['H3K27me3 depletion']]
571529efcb4ef8864c000001	Which antibiotics target peptidoglycan biosynthesis?	Treatment with antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibits chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium To detect cells just after division, we used colchicine, which inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division We investigated the effects of antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis on chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex Recent advances in pneumococcal peptidoglycan biosynthesis suggest new vaccine and antimicrobial targets. Of late, the peptidoglycan (PG) layer, the most important component of the bacterial cell wall has been the subject of drug targeting because, first, it is essential for the survivability of eubacteria and secondly, it is absent in humans. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. A dose-response experiment with an E. coli strain susceptible to ampicillin demonstrated a weak effect before the MIC dose.  In an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of Escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Here, we compare the staining patterns observed in Bacillus subtilis using fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. Ramoplanin probes may be better imaging agents than vancomycin probes because they yield clear staining patterns at concentrations well below their minimum inhibitory concentrations. Structures of the muraymycins, novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis.  Rethinking ramoplanin: the role of substrate binding in inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Vancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. The lantibiotic mersacidin has been previously reported to interfere with bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant bacteria by a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic. LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism? Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. n contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ramoplanin. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria. Bacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium. This effect does not involve a change in the permeability of the cell wall by this drug and is consistent with the identification of D-alanine racemase as a target of D-cycloserine.  CONCLUSIONS: Several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation.  The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment.  Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.  Fosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc and alanine-alanine. In contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface. The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Modulation of transport processes, cofactor biosynthesis, energy metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis was also observed. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.

Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487 The ligands bind RET through GDNF family receptor alpha, termed GFRalpha1-4 RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin GDNF availability determines enteric neuron number by controlling precursor proliferation Five germline mutations in the glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene, one of the RET ligands, have been detected in HSCR patients. The glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors alpha (GFRalpha) are cell surface bound glycoproteins that mediate interactions of the GDNF ligand family with the RET receptor In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.  Mutations in genes that encode RET ligands (GDNF and NTN); components of another signaling pathway (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE-1); and the transcription factor, SOX10, have been identified in HSCR patients. Expression of RET and its ligand complexes, GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2, in medullary thyroid carcinomas Mutations in the GDNF gene, and encoding one of the RET ligands, either alone or in combination with RET mutations, can also cause HSCR, as can mutations in four other genes (EDN3, EDNRB, ECE1, and SOX10) In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.  Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin. Mutation of the RET ligand, neurturin, supports multigenic inheritance in Hirschsprung disease Considering that RET and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mutations have been reported in the disease, we regarded the other RET ligand, neurturin (NTN), as an attractive candidate gene, especially as it shares large homologies with GDNF Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease The c-ret protooncogene, RET, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a ligand of RET tyrosine kinase, and its family ligands promote the survival and differentiation of a variety of neurons. We demonstrate here that, after injury, the absence of c-Jun specifically in SCs caused impaired axonal regeneration and severely increased neuronal cell death. c-Jun deficiency resulted in decreased expression of several neurotrophic factors, and GDNF and Artemin, both of which encode ligands for the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, were identified as novel direct c-Jun target genes. GDNF, now known to be the first identified member of a family of factors, signals through the previously known receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret. Unlike most ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, GDNF does not bind and activate Ret directly, but requires the presence of GPI-linked coreceptors. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In 1996, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was identified as one of the ligands of the RET transmembrane receptor. The ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose ligands belong to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein family. RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin. Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor molecule GDNFR-alpha, have recently been identified as members of the RET ligand binding complex Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET Replacing short segments of GDNF with the homologous segments from persephin (PSPN) (which cannot bind or activate GFRalpha1.RET or GFRalpha2.RET) identified sites along the second finger of GDNF critical for activating the GFRalpha1.RET and GFRalpha2.RET receptor complexes GDNF mediates its actions through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a ligand-binding glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (designated GDNFR-alpha) and the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase Ret	[['GDNF', 'glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor'], ['ARTN', 'artemin'], ['NTN', 'neurturin'], ['PSPN', 'persephin']]

Treatment with silica resulted in morphological changes typical of apoptotic cells, enhanced DNA fragmentation (a characteristic feature of programmed cell death), and significant alveolar macrophage apoptosis as observed by cell death ELISA assays. Programmed cell death and DNA fragmentation were detected by Nile blue staining and cytochemical labeling of DNA fragmentation, respectively, in the interdigital mesoderm and in the regions of presumptive joints of the digit. Treatment with silica resulted in morphological changes typical of apoptotic cells, enhanced DNA fragmentation (a characteristic feature of programmed cell death), and significant alveolar macrophage apoptosis as observed by cell death ELISA assays. Cell were treated with these particulates in vitro for 6 and 24 hr and examined for apoptosis by morphological analysis, DNA fragmentation, and levels of cytosolic histone-bound DNA fragments (cell death ELISA assays). Featured in this unit is the TUNEL method of detecting cells that exhibit DNA fragmentation, which can also be performed on tissue sections to locate apoptotic cells in situ.

56bb616dac7ad10019000008	What medication were compared in the ROCKET AF Trial?	METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients randomized in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial (n = 14 264) were grouped by baseline AF category: paroxysmal or persistent. Multivariable adjustment was performed to compare thrombo-embolic events, bleeding, and death between groups, in high-risk subgroups, and across treatment assignment (rivaroxaban or warfarin).  This review focuses on the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world settings are underway.  Rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in East Asian patients from the ROCKET AF trial. CONCLUSIONS: Observed relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin were similar among patients within and outside East Asia.  Rivaroxaban versus warfarin in Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in relation to the CHADS2 score: a subgroup analysis of the J-ROCKET AF trial. BACKGROUND: Results from a trial of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in 1280 Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation (J-ROCKET AF) revealed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the principal safety outcome.  Rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa-inhibitor was non-inferior to adjusted dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and embolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ROCKET-AF trial and has been approved for stroke prevention in AF. The ROCKET AF trial compared rivaroxaban (20 mg/day; 15 mg/day in patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in 14,264 patients with AF and a prior history of stroke or at least two other additional risk factors for stroke. Factors associated with major bleeding events: insights from the ROCKET AF trial (rivaroxaban once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation). In Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) trial, rivaroxaban was noninferior to dose-adjusted warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at moderate to high stroke risk. Different clinical trials have shown the benefits of new oral anticoagulants over warfarin, but patients included in the ROCKET-AF trial were found to be at a higher risk of AF-related complications. The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, with a similar rate of major bleeding and a substantial reduction in intracranial hemorrhage.

Investigation of the effects of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan, a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy subjects. Macitentan is a potent, orally active, non-peptide antagonist of endothelin receptors with tissue-targeting properties, currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Interaction profile of macitentan, a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, in vitro. Macitentan is a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  This article highlights how the introduction of new compounds such as macitentan, riociguat and selexipag, which act on the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways, respectively, have the potential to further improve the prognosis for patients with PAH. Dual ETRA/ETRB blockade with macitentan (or the combination of the ETRA and ETRB antagonists BQ123 and BQ788) did not enhance antitumor immune cell recruitment.  The novel ERA macitentan has recently concluded testing in a Phase III morbidity/mortality clinical trial in PAH patients.  Given that the newest PAH drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently required.  The discovery of N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-[2-[(5-bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-4-pyrimidinyl]-N'-propylsulfamide (Macitentan), an orally active, potent dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Among these, compound 17 (macitentan, ACT-064992) emerged as particularly interesting as it is a potent inhibitor of ET(A) with significant affinity for the ET(B) receptor and shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and high in vivo efficacy in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats.  Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.  Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan soon available) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil).  The aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and its major metabolite (ACT-132577) on alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression, evaluated on dermal fibroblasts from healthy subjects and on dermal fibroblasts from lesional and non-lesional skin from sclerodermic patients.  Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in an ascending multiple-dose study in healthy subjects. This multiple-ascending-dose study investigated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, of macitentan, a new endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding and enhanced tissue penetration properties compared to other ERAs. We assessed the efficacy of macitentan, a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist, using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial. Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug. Promising candidates include tyrosine kinase antagonists (e.g. imatinib); soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (riociguat); an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag); and a tissue targeting endothelin receptor antagonist (macitentan). Pharmacokinetics of the novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment.

Macitentan, a tissue-targeting endothelin receptor antagonist for the potential oral treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Macitentan (ACT-064992), under development by Actelion Ltd in collaboration with Japanese licensee Nippon Shinyaku Co Ltd, is an orally active, non-peptide dual endothelin (ET)(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Macitentan, because of its ability to target the tissues and to block both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors, is emerging as a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation.  Comparison of the dissolution and pharmacokinetic profiles of two galenical formulations of the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan. Macitentan (ACT-064992) is an orally active endothelin receptor antagonist.  Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting. Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors).  In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats.

58a45d6060087bc10a00001d	Which diseases are involved in the severe cutaneous reactions (SCAR) spectrum?	Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are diseases within the spectrum of severe cutaneous adverse reactions affecting skin and mucous membranes.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions that predominantly involve the skin and mucous membranes. Currently, TEN and SJS are considered to be two ends of a spectrum of severe epidermolytic adverse cutaneous drug reactions, differing only by their extent of skin detachment.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are considered part of a spectrum of adverse cutaneous drug reactions showing severe and extensive skin detachment. Our aim was to study patch testing in severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and other cutaneous ADRs) However, allopurinol is also one of the most common causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which include drug hypersensitivity syndrome, StevensâJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Drug eruptions range from transient erythema to the life threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) that encompass Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms complex (DRESS).To study the clinical and epidemiological aspects of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR).Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) are severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) which are majorly caused by drugs This study investigated the association between the HLA class I genotype and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) in Koreans.Twenty-four patients who had developed carbamazepine-induced SCAR (7 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 17 drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS)), 50 carbamazepine-tolerant controls from the Korean Pharmacogenetic Adverse Drug Reaction Research Network and data of 485 Korean general population from a previously published study were recruited Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (SCAR) represents the spectrum of adverse drug reactions from erythema multiforme, Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) to Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon but extremely serious and often life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions characterized by extensive epithelial sloughing and systemic symptoms. There is no effective evidence-based treatment for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) to drugs and no consensus on how to treat these patients. However, allopurinol is also one of the most common causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which include drug hypersensitivity syndrome, StevensâJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. A variant allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B, HLA-B*58:01, associates strongly with allopurinolinduced SCAR. The skin is often involved in ADRs and although most cutaneous ADRs have a favorable course, they may present as severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. By comparison, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), mainly caused by drugs. The study sought to identify the magnitude and characteristic of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR's) like Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). Allopurinol, an antihyperuricaemic agent, is one of the common causes of life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN).

5506a7a48e1671127b000008	Which protein phosphatases have been found to dephosphorylate phospholamban?	The protein phosphatases which dephosphorylate native, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-associated phospholamban were studied in cardiac muscle extracts and in a Triton fraction prepared by detergent extraction of myofibrils, the latter fraction containing 70-80% of the SR-associated proteins present in the tissue. At physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ (1 mM), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) accounted for approximately 70% of the total phospholamban phosphatase activity in these fractions towards either Ser-16 (the residue labelled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PK-A) or Thr-17 (the residue phosphorylated by an SR-associated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) accounted for the remainder of the activity. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A	[['Protein Phosphatase 1', 'PP1'], ['Protein phosphatase 2A', 'PP2A'], ['Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'PP2C'], ['Protein Phosphatase 2B', 'PP2B']]

530db83b38c1322806000002	Which proteins cause cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kB?	Sef is an inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine signaling, acting by cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-ÎºB According to the classical model, NF-ÎºB is retained in the cytoplasm of resting cells via binding to inhibitory, IÎºB proteins and translocates into the nucleus upon their ligand-induced degradation. Like IÎºBs, Sef sequesters NF-ÎºB in the cytoplasm of resting cells. The activity of NF-ÎºB is tightly controlled through its cytoplasmic sequestration by specific inhibitors, IÎºBs. The inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) family of proteins is believed to regulate NF-kappaB activity by cytoplasmic sequestration. IkappaBalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters NF-kappaB dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. p105.Ikappa Bgamma and prototypical Ikappa Bs use a similar mechanism to bind but a different mechanism to regulate the subcellular localization of NF-kappa B We show that the death domain of p105 (also of IkappaBgamma) is essential for the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by p105 and IkappaBgamma. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappaB transcription factors are retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. The ability of the IkappaB alpha protein to sequester dimeric NF-kappaB/Rel proteins in the cytoplasm provides an effective mechanism for regulating the potent transcriptional activation properties of NF-kappaB/Rel family members. The presence of a discrete nuclear import sequence in IkappaB alpha suggests that cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-kappaB/Rel-IkappaB alpha complex is a consequence of the mutual masking of the NLS within NF-kappaB/Rel proteins and the import sequence within IkappaB alpha. The viral Tax protein, which is encoded by human T-cell leukaemia virus HTLV-I, activates nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors and relieves cytoplasmic sequestration of RelA and Rel by heterodimerization with NF-kappa B1/p1O5 (refs 1,2). The I-kappa B protein, which is necessary for the cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-kappa B transcription factor complex, was identified specifically in regions of limbic, hypothalamic, and autonomic nuclei. Human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax-protein-mediated activation of NF-kappa B from p100 (NF-kappa B2)-inhibited cytoplasmic reservoirs The preexisting NF-kappa B proteins are retained in the cytoplasm of cells by association with inhibitory ankyrin-motif-containing I kappa B proteins, primarily I kappa B-alpha but also including the precursor proteins p105 (NF-kappa B1) and p100 (NF-kappa B2).

The increasing role of metabolomics in system biology is driving the development of tools for comprehensive analysis of high-resolution NMR spectral datasets. Proteomics technology, a major component of system biology, has gained comprehensive attention in the area of medical diagnosis, drug development, and mechanism research. Metabolomics complements other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics and since it is a 'downstream' result of gene expression, changes in the metabolome is considered to best reflect the activities of the cell at a functional level.  In addition, integrated applications with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics provide greater understanding of global system biology. From proteomics to integrated omics towards system biology. In recent years, in the post genomic era, more and more data is being generated by biological high throughput technologies, such as proteomics and transcriptomics.

5a70ce4ab750ff4455000064	List the 6 genes associated with the autosomal recessive form of Osteogenesis imperfecta	Patients offspring of nonconsanguineous parents were mostly identified withCOL1A1orCOL1A2heterozygous changes, although there were also a few cases withIFITM5andWNT1heterozygous mutations. Only one sporadic patient was a compound heterozygote for two recessive mutations. Patients offspring of consanguineous parents showed homozygous changes in a variety of genes includingCRTAP,FKBP10,LEPRE1,PLOD2,PPIB,SERPINF1,TMEM38B, andWNT1. here is minimal literature on the mechanism of action for variants in SERPINH1 resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta  The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. hese results expand the range of CRTAP/LEPRE1 mutations that result in recessive OI  Autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) accounts for 10% of all OI cases, and, currently, mutations in 10 genes (CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, SERPINH1, FKBP10, SERPINF1, SP7, BMP1, TMEM38B, and WNT1) are known to be responsible for this form of the disease. We have recently shown that FKBP10 previously reported as a novel autosomal recessive OI gene also defines a novel Bruck syndrome locus (BKS3). Autosomal recessive mutations in a number of genes have also been described, including the BMP1 gene that encodes the mammalian Tolloid (mTLD) and its shorter isoform bone morphogenic protein-1 (BMP1). n this article, we performed clinical assessment and sought mutations in patients from 10 unrelated families with AR-OI, one of whom was presented with the additional features of Bruck syndrome (BS). Pathogenic changes were identified in five different genes: three families had mutations in FKBP10, three in SERPINF1, two in LEPRE1, one in CRTAP, and one in PPIB.  Two of the genes encoding proteins involved in that enzyme complex, LEPRE1 and cartilage-associated protein, when mutated have been shown to cause autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta The discovery of mutations involving CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes in severe/lethal and recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta has provided partial answers to questions about 'other' osteogenesis imperfecta genes in patients with an osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype but no COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations	[['Sp7/Osx'], ['FK506-binding protein'], ['Hsp47/SERPINH1'], ['CRTAP'], ['P3H1'], ['PPIB'], ['WNT1'], ['LEPRE1'], ['PLOD2'], ['TMEM38B'], ['BMP1'], ['SEC24D'], ['cartilage associated protein']]

5358e067f1005d6b5800000b	Which proteins are involved in actin bundling and filopodia formation and function?	CRP1, a protein localized in filopodia of growth cones, is involved in dendritic growth CRP1, which cross-links actin filaments to make actin bundles, is the only CRP family member expressed in the CNS with little known about its function in nerve cells. Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of CRP1 expression by short hairpin RNA interference results in inhibition of filopodia formation and dendritic growth in neurons. Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity. F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. In this study, we investigated the role of fascin, a cytoskeleton actin-bundling protein involved in the formation of filopodia and cell migration, in prostate cancer progression. In cellular models, fascin gene silencing using small interfering RNA in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145 decreased cell motility and invasiveness while increasing cell adhesive properties. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that induces membrane protrusions and cell motility after the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia. The PCH family member MAYP/PSTPIP2 directly regulates F-actin bundling and enhances filopodia formation and motility in macrophages Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation. We report an unexpected direct association between fascin, an actin-bundling component of filopodia, microspikes and lamellipodial ribs, and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), a regulator of focal adhesions. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. Actin-crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells. IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo. Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo. Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8. Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions. The bundling activity of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is required for filopodium formation Filopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia. Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments. Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Role of the actin bundling protein fascin in growth cone morphogenesis: localization in filopodia and lamellipodia Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia. Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons. Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles. Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones. Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles.

52ef7754c8da898910000014	Which proteins act as histone-like molecules in prokaryotes?	We show that Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring (H-NS) protein can facilitate correct recognition of a promoter by RNA polymerase in AT-rich gene regulatory regions One feature is a histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin Recently the histone-like proteins were found in some primitive eucaryotes and procaryotes The relationship between HMGs (1 + 2) and the "primitive" histone-like DNA-packaging proteins from prokaryotes and mitochondria is discussed The amino acid composition of the protein resembled those of the other prokaryotic histone-like proteins and also to eukaryotic histones H2A and H2B In prokaryotes and in the pool of vegetative phage DNA the most abundant histone-like protein HU is not associated with the bulk DNA, but localised in the border region with ribosomes where transcription and translation occur Like the histones, HU is able to condense DNA in vitro and to introduce negative super-coiling in covalently closed circular, relaxed DNA molecules in the presence of topoisomerase I HU is well conserved in all prokaryotes but surprisingly, it is also homologous to another E. coli DNA-binding protein, IHF Here we describe the identification of two developmental stage-specific genes, one of which is predicted to encode a 26-kDa lysine- and alanine-rich protein that appears to be homologous to several eukaryotic histone H1 proteins No sequence homology was observed between this protein and other bacterial "histone-like" chromosomal proteins, but homology does exist with two other recently described prokaryotic proteins In this study we show that these proteins can substitute for the prokaryotic DNA-bending protein HU in promoting the assembly of the Hin invertasome, an intermediate structure in Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion We have characterized the role of HU in assembling the invertasome, an intermediate nucleoprotein complex involved in Hin-mediated site-specific recombination Using ligase-mediated circularization of short DNA fragments we also show that HU, the high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins from mammals, and

nucleoids revealed essential differences in the two lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes, namely nucleoids of green plants contain sulfite reductase as a major DNA-binding protein that represses the genomic activity, whereas the prokaryotic DNA-binding protein HU is abundant in plastid nucleoids of the rhodophyte lineage In prokaryotes, IHF and HU are key architectural proteins present at high concentrations The deficit of TFs in some genomes might be compensated by the presence of proteins organizing and compacting DNA, such as histone-like proteins okaryotic histone-like proteins (Hlps)

58dfd83a6fddd3e83e000003	List genes associated with hypolipidemia.	 Conversely familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is caused by inactivation of the PCSK9 gene which increases the number of LDL receptors and decreases plasma cholesterol. Mutations in the genes APOB, and ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 (that encode angiopoietin-like proteins which inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity) can further cause low levels of apoB containing lipoproteins Several mutations in the apoB, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and MTP genes result in low or absent levels of apoB and LDL-cholesterol in plasma, which cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia. Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia.  Mutations of the ANGPTL3 gene have been associated with a novel form of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia, the combined hypolipidemia (cHLP), characterized by low total cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol levels.  These results demonstrated that in a cohort of subjects with severe primary hypobetalipoproteinemia the prevalence of ANGPTL3 gene mutations responsible for a combined hypolipidemia phenotype is about 10%, whereas mutations of APOB gene are absent. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum.

5a76344e9e632bc066000003	Which algorithms are used for compression of SAM files?	GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files The most popular format for genomic data is the SAM format, which contains information such as alignment, quality values, etc. These files are large (on the order of terabytes), which necessitates compression. In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode. The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations. Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data. Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data. In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data. One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available. Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of sequencing a genome. This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted. To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e.g. FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain). Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available. We describe CSAM (Compressed SAM format), a compression approach offering lossless and lossy compression for SAM files. GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files.

54fc9ca16ad7dcbc12000006	Which receptors are targeted by suvorexant?	Dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonists (DORAs) such as almorexant, 1 (SB-649868), or suvorexant have shown promise for the treatment of insomnias and sleep disorders in several recent clinical trials in volunteers and primary insomnia patients.  Several such compounds have entered into clinical development, including the dual orexin receptor antagonists, suvorexant and almorexant.  Suvorexant (MK-4305) is an orexin receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of insomnia.  Indeed, phase III clinical trials were completed last year of suvorexant, a non-selective (dual) antagonist for orexin receptors, for the treatment of primary insomnia, and demonstrate promising results. METHODS: We evaluated suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, for treating patients with primary insomnia in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period (4 weeks per period) crossover polysomnography study. Suvorexant is a dual orexin antagonist currently in Phase III clinical trials for the modulation of sleep and is being developed by Merck. Merck's suvorexant (MK-4305) is the first compound of the so-called dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) class expected to be submitted for FDA approval, with a new drug application anticipated in 2012.  A concise, enantioselective synthesis of the potent dual orexin inhibitor suvorexant (1) is reported.  Reaction development and mechanistic study of a ruthenium catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric reductive amination en route to the dual Orexin inhibitor Suvorexant (MK-4305). The first example of an intramolecular asymmetric reductive amination of a dialkyl ketone with an aliphatic amine has been developed for the synthesis of Suvorexant (MK-4305), a potent dual Orexin antagonist under development for the treatment of sleep disorders.  Suvorexant (MK-4305) is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable antagonist of OX(1)R and OX(2)R currently under clinical investigation as a novel therapy for insomnia. Suvorexant is a pharmacologically novel dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R, which has an effect that promotes sleep by reducing arousal and wakefulness.  Indeed, phase III clinical trials were completed last year of suvorexant, a non-selective (dual) antagonist for orexin receptors, for the treatment of primary insomnia, and demonstrate promising results.  In order to understand the differential contribution of both receptors in regulating sleep/wakefulness states we compared the pharmacological effects of a newly developed OX2R antagonist (2-SORA), Compound 1 m (C1 m), with those of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), suvorexant, in C57BL/6J mice.

51487ef9d24251bc05000031	Which two catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors can be used for treatment of Parkinson disease?	Entacapone is a highly potent, reversible, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used as an adjunct to L-dopa in the treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Stalevo is a combination tablet comprised of levodopa, carbidopa, and the COMT inhibitor entacapone. It is available in fixed-dose combinations of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, 50/12.5/200, 75/18.75/200, 100/25/200, 125/31.25/200, 150/37.5/200 and 200/50/200 mg. Stalevo is currently approved for use in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose wearing off. Good news were marketing of ropinirole, a new non-ergot agonist, in December 2006 and entacapone, the first catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor in Japan in April 2007. Having faced these new situations, Japanese Neurological Association has started revising "the Guideline 2002 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease". Stalevo (Orion) combines levodopa, the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa and the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone in a single tablet. We investigated whether administration of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, alters the pharmacokinetics of apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients experiencing severe motor fluctuations. The catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone is given in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off. Entacapone (Comtess/Comtan) is Orion Pharma's original proprietary catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor. Entacapone is able to slow down degradation of levodopa and improve the availability and efficacy of each levodopa dose, hence its use as a complement to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sleep attacks in Parkinson's disease induced by Entacapone, a COMT-inhibitor. We present a patient who suffered from sleep attacks after starting entacapone in addition to levodopa. Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, alters the pharmacokinetics of levodopa, leading to increase of levodopa concentration in plasma and brain. Two COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been made available as adjunctive agents to levodopa Two inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been introduced as adjuncts to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients. Tolcapone, a peripheral and central COMT inhibitor, appears to be quite effective, producing a 47% reduction in 'off' time. . Entacapone, a purely peripheral COMT inhibitor with a lower potency than tolcapone, has also proved to be effective and has not been associated with liver damage, obviating the need for testing. Here we report that a treatment of the cerebral tissue with tolcapone, a central and peripheral inhibitor of COMT, does not change the membrane responses of midbrain dopamine neurons to dopamine and levodopa. Therefore, the therapeutic action of tolcapone in Parkinson's disease, might be dependent on the reduction of COMT activity in the extracerebral tissue. Pretreatment with entacapone (OR-611), a peripheral catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor, greatly reduces the plasma 3OMFD fraction and provides an ideal situation to evaluate the contribution of the plasma 3OMFD fraction in several kinetic models of FDOPA uptake. The novel and reversible inhibitors are the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitors, Ro 40-7592 (3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone), and the monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, Ro 19-6327 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-2-pyridine carboxamide HC1).

52bf1d6003868f1b0600000e	Which are the subtypes of Pfeiffer syndrome?	Of 802 patients treated for craniosynostosis, 28 were identified with Pfeiffer syndrome: 17 were classified as type I (61 percent), seven were classified as type II (25 percent), and four were classified as type III (14 percent).  Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes. Type 1 "classic" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull.  Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth.  It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307]. Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases. These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy. Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence.

54e0dfa91388e8454a000018	List components of the CRSP/Med complex.	 Here we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately 700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K. Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor TFIIS. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that are shared with other cofactor complexes. The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators) and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the Med220 and the Med70 subunits.

56b739d976d8bf8d13000005	List available genetic multicolor cell labeling techiniques in Drosophila	Flybow: genetic multicolor cell labeling for neural circuit analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. To facilitate studies of neural network architecture and formation, we generated three Drosophila melanogaster variants of the mouse Brainbow-2 system, called Flybow. Sequences encoding different membrane-tethered fluorescent proteins were arranged in pairs within cassettes flanked by recombination sites. Flybow combines the Gal4-upstream activating sequence binary system to regulate transgene expression and an inducible modified Flp-FRT system to drive inversions and excisions of cassettes. This provides spatial and temporal control over the stochastic expression of one of two or four reporters within one sample. Using the visual system, the embryonic nervous system and the wing imaginal disc, we show that Flybow in conjunction with specific Gal4 drivers can be used to visualize cell morphology with high resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this labeling approach is compatible with available Flp-FRT-based techniques, such as mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker; this could further support the genetic analysis of neural circuit assembly and function. Drosophila Brainbow: a recombinase-based fluorescence labeling technique to subdivide neural expression patterns. We developed a multicolor neuron labeling technique in Drosophila melanogaster that combines the power to specifically target different neural populations with the label diversity provided by stochastic color choice. This adaptation of vertebrate Brainbow uses recombination to select one of three epitope-tagged proteins detectable by immunofluorescence. Two copies of this construct yield six bright, separable colors. We used Drosophila Brainbow to study the innervation patterns of multiple antennal lobe projection neuron lineages in the same preparation and to observe the relative trajectories of individual aminergic neurons. Nerve bundles, and even individual neurites hundreds of micrometers long, can be followed with definitive color labeling. We traced motor neurons in the subesophageal ganglion and correlated them to neuromuscular junctions to identify their specific proboscis muscle targets. The ability to independently visualize multiple lineage or neuron projections in the same preparation greatly advances the goal of mapping how neurons connect into circuits.

5c6e01af7c78d69471000048	List two indications of Letermovir?	Latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution (Vyzulta) for the reduction of intraocular pressure; letermovir (Prevymis) for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection and disease after stem cell transplant; benralizumab (Fasenra) for the add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma of an eosinophilic phenotype. Letermovir has been approved in Canada and the USA for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of letermovir leading to its first global approval in Canada as well as the USA for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic HSCT. A new terminase inhibitor, letermovir, recently proved effective against HCMV in phase III clinical trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear.  Letermovir is being developed for human cytomegalovirus infection treatment and prophylaxis.  Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor for cytomegalovirus infection prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.  Role of letermovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this article, the role of the newly approved antiviral compound, letermovir, is reviewed.RECENT FINDINGS: Letermovir inhibits CMV by interfering viral terminase complex. In a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical study that enrolled 495 CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients, the primary end point of clinically significant CMV infection was significantly reduced by letermovir prophylaxis. SUMMARY: Letermovir is an important addition to the current strategies for CMV prevention after allogeneic HSCT.  Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) terminase inhibitor recently approved as prophylaxis in stem cell transplant recipients. Letermovir is a novel antiviral in clinical development for prophylaxis against human cytomegalovirus in immunocompromised transplant recipients. Expert commentary: With the introduction of letermovir, prevention of CMV infection in allo-HCT recipients may shift considerably, from a predominantly preemptive strategy to one that utilizes this novel therapy for prophylaxis. The positive results from the recently published Phase III study of letermovir for prevention of CMV infection in CMV-seropositive allo-HCT recipients led to its approval as a prophylactic agent for CMV in multiple countries. Letermovir has shown promising clinical efficacy and is generally well tolerated, thus providing a favorable new option in the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease.

58bd645702b8c60953000010	Please list 3 diseases associated with the PIEZO2 gene.	Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). Different mutations of this gene also cause distal arthrogryposis type 5 and Marden-Walker syndrome. Mutations in PIEZO2 cause Gordon syndrome, Marden-Walker syndrome, and distal arthrogryposis type 5. Both types of changes in kinetics result in increased channel activity in response to a given mechanical stimulus, suggesting that Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2. Here, we describe two distinct PIEZO2 mutations in patients with a subtype of Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 characterized by generalized autosomal dominant contractures with limited eye movements, restrictive lung disease, and variable absence of cruciate knee ligaments. Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). In contrast, heterozygous gain-of-function missense mutations, mainly localized at the C terminus, cause dominant distal arthrogryposis 3 (DA3), distal arthrogryposis 5 (DA5), or Marden-Walker syndrome (MWKS), which encompass contractures of hands and feet, scoliosis, ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis.

58eb6061eda5a57672000005	In which fields of DNA sequencing are Bloom filters applied?	A novel algorithm, fast and accurate classification of sequences (FACSs), is introduced that can accurately and rapidly classify sequences as belonging or not belonging to a reference sequence.  Classification of DNA sequences using Bloom filters Lighter is a fast, memory-efficient tool for correcting sequencing errors. Lighter avoids counting k-mers. Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. Fast lossless compression via cascading Bloom filters In contrast to reference-based methods that first align reads to the genome, we hash all reads into Bloom filters to encode, and decode by querying the same Bloom filters using read-length subsequences of the reference genome. Further compression is achieved by using a cascade of such filters Using cascading Bloom filters to improve the memory usage for de Brujin graphs In this work, we show how to reduce the memory required by the data structure of Chikhi and Rizk (WABI'12) that represents de Brujin graphs using Bloom filters. We introduce a novel hash-based method for constructing the string graph. We use incremental hashing, and specifically a modification of the Karp-Rabin fingerprint, and Bloom filters Further, we note that Bloom filters would be suitable to implicitly store spaced seeds and be tolerant to sequencing errors.  It uses a pair of cache oblivious Bloom filters, one holding a uniform sample of [Formula: see text]-spaced sequenced [Formula: see text]-mers and the other holding [Formula: see text]-mers classified as likely correct, using a simple statistical test. Improving Bloom Filter Performance on Sequence Data Using k-mer Bloom Filters BFs reduce the memory footprint required to store millions of k-mers while allowing for fast set containment queries, at the cost of a low false positive rate (FPR). We consider several variants of such k-mer Bloom filters (kBFs), derive theoretical upper bounds for their FPR, and discuss their range of applications and limitations.

5c596ad686df2b9174000015	Which integrin genes are activated by the immune system in inflammatory bowel disease?	Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1).

54d8d60d014675820d000007	List BRAF inhibitors that have been tested in clinical trials for treatment of melanoma patients	Combined BRAF (Dabrafenib) and MEK inhibition (Trametinib) in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma experiencing progression with single-agent BRAF inhibitor.  Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45).  This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.  METHODS: All patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib or combination BRAF inhibitor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia underwent regular dermatological assessments for the duration of therapy. We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma.  We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor.  However, it is becoming evident that the effects of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by BRAF inhibitors in non-BRAF-mutant cells needs to be taken into account, which may be implicated in the problems encountered in the first clinical trial testing a combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), with significant liver toxicities. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab. Thirty-one patients commenced dabrafenib therapy including six individuals who had progressed on a prior BRAF-inhibitor treatment. Population pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor: effect of dose, time, covariates, and relationship with its metabolites. Dabrafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma.  This was a prospective study of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600 mutation and treated with iBRAF within a clinical trial (dabrafenib) or as part of an expanded access program (vemurafenib). We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma.  Tumor genetic analyses of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436). PURPOSE: Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF kinase, which recently showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with dacarbazine, in metastatic melanoma patients.  Phase II trial (BREAK-2) of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436) in patients with metastatic melanoma. PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a concerning toxicity with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment for melanoma. While the two drugs shown to improve survival, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, have similar efficacy, the reported rates of cSCC are quite different. PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy.  BACKGROUND: The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test is a CE-marked and FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic assay used to select patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib The purpose of this study is to review the development of BRAF inhibitors, with emphasis on the trials conducted with dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the evolving role of dabrafenib in treatment for melanoma patients. Dabrafenib inhibits the mutant BRAF (BRAF(mut)) protein in melanomas with BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) genotypes. To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Cutaneous manifestations of dabrafenib (GSK2118436): a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF in patients with metastatic melanoma. We conducted a systematic prospective dermatological review of all patients enrolled at a single institution in the phase I/II clinical trial of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy. Neoplastic leptomeningitis presenting in a melanoma patient treated with dabrafenib (a V600EBRAF inhibitor): a case report. For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy. BACKGROUND: The development of keratoacanthomas (KAs) and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is a known adverse effect of novel BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with stage IV melanoma who received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) as part of a clinical trial and developed numerous diffuse, pathology-proven KAs and SCCs.  CONCLUSIONS: Given vemurafenib's recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, we provide a timely case report on the effective use of PDT in the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-associated KAs and SCCs.  The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has shown up to 78% objective response rates in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation but not in patients lacking the mutation.  The oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial.  CONTEXT: A polymerase chain reaction-based companion diagnostic (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to select patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma for treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.  However, in the recent clinical trial of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response.  Vemurafenib (RG7204/PLX4032), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown striking clinical efficacy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, creating the need for a well-validated companion diagnostic to select patients for treatment. BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib is the first molecularly targeted therapy to be licensed in the US and Europe for treatment of advanced melanoma Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway	[['Vemurafenib'], ['Dabrafenib']]

PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. A pilot study of focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor. This preliminary study investigates the use of transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor.METHODS: From February 2011 through December 2011, in an open-label, uncontrolled study, we used transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound to target the unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus in 15 patients with severe, medication-refractory essential tremor. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, essential tremor improved in 15 patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor: a proof-of-concept study. MR-guided focused ultrasound has been developed as a non-invasive means of generating precisely placed focal lesions. We examined its application to the management of essential tremor Four patients with chronic and medication-resistant essential tremor were treated with MR-guided focused ultrasound to ablate tremor-mediating areas of the thalamus. INTERPRETATION: MR-guided focused ultrasound might be a safe and effective approach to generation of focal intracranial lesions for the management of disabling, medication-resistant essential tremor. Transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound: noninvasive central lateral thalamotomy for chronic neuropathic pain. The goal of this study was to apply the new transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) technology to perform noninvasive central lateral thalamotomies (CLTs) as a treatment for chronic neuropathic pain.METHODS: In 12 patients suffering from chronic therapy-resistant neuropathic pain, tcMRgFUS CLT was proposed.  CONCLUSIONS: The authors assert that tcMRgFUS represents a noninvasive, precise, and radiation-free neurosurgical technique for the treatment of neuropathic pain. A new less invasive treatment of tremor using MR guided focused ultrasound has started and is promising. Quality-of-life scores improved from 37% to 11% (P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, essential tremor improved in 15 patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. Seven PD patients, mean age 59.4 Â± 9.8 years (range, 46-74) with a mean disease duration of 5.4 Â± 2.8 years (range, 2-10) suffering from severe refractory tremor, underwent ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy using MRI guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), an innovative technology that enables noninvasive surgery We hypothesized that all three would effectively treat the dominant hand and positively impact functional outcomes and quality of life as measured with the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire.This is a retrospective study of medication-refractory essential tremor patients treated at the University of Virginia with bilateral Vim DBS (nâ=â57), unilateral Vim DBS (nâ=â13), or unilateral focused ultrasound Vim thalamotomy (nâ=â15) Quality-of-life scores improved from 37% to 11% (P=0.001).In this pilot study, essential tremor improved in 15 patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy MRI Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Moderate-to-Severe Tremor in Parkinsons Disease Seven PD patients, mean age 59.4 Â± 9.8 years (range, 46-74) with a mean disease duration of 5.4 Â± 2.8 years (range, 2-10) suffering from severe refractory tremor, underwent ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy using MRI guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), an innovative technology that enables noninvasive surgery. Transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is gaining attention as a potent substitute for surgical intervention in the treatment of neurologic disorders. To discern the neurophysiologic correlates of its therapeutic effects, we applied MRgHIFU to an intractable neurologic disorder, essential tremor, while measuring magnetoencephalogram mu rhythms from the motor cortex. Focused ultrasound sonication destroyed tissues by focusing a high-energy beam on the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

In group 2 and 3, two anomalies, anorectal malformation and cystic fibrosis, were detected postnatally Six had chromosomal/genetic abnormalities, two had congenital cytomegalovirus, none had cystic fibrosis Primary bowel pathology is rare following the finding of FEB Maternal serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV) was performed in 49 (78%) cases Thirty-three pregnancies (53%) were tested for cystic fibrosis (CF) and 1 baby was confirmed to have CF postnatally This study reiterates the increased prevalence of aneuploidy, CMV, CF and fetal growth restriction in pregnancies complicated by the midtrimester sonographic finding of FEB Primary outcomes were IUGR, defined as birth weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age and intrauterine fetal demise at 20 weeks or more of gestatio Analyses were repeated after excluding cases of aneuploidy, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, The presence of echogenic bowel on ultrasonography is independently associated with an increased risk for both IUGR and intrauterine fetal demise This study highlights the importance of pregnancy ultrasound examinations and their efficiency in detecting cystic fibrosis A disorder was diagnosed in 32.2% of the fetuses, cystic fibrosis being the most commonly identified (7.6%). We also found digestive malformations (7.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.7%), and maternofetal infections (3.7%). A potential association with placental abnormalities and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed Our data suggests an inverse relationship between the maternal BMI and the detection of fetal EIF and/or EB Fetal echogenic bowel at 17 weeks' gestational age as the early and only sign of a very long segment of Hirschsprung disease. fetal ultrasound findings associated with intrauterine cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection the combination of hydrops fetalis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hyperechoic bowel should raise the possibility of a CMV infection strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome due to utero-placental insufficiency, particularly in women with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration due to severe feto-maternal bleeding Congenital cytomegalovirus infection presenting with echogenic bowel and oligohydramnios. Five cases of trisomy 21 and one case of trisomy 18 were detected Brightly echogenic bowel in the second trimester was found to be associated with a significant risk of fetal aneuploidy. echogenic bowel does not uniformly herald an abnormal outcome. Echogenic bowel coexistent with other abnormalities (such as growth deficiency or structural malformations) may be a comarker for aneuploidy. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection with oligohydramnios and echogenic bowel at 14 weeks' gestation Parental CF carrier testing and amniocentesis to identify aneuploidy or fetal CF status has a high positive ascertainment rate in fetuses with echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3.

5883a25d7ffa0d4374000001	What are the roles of Smyd3 in zebrafish?	Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. In addition, these phenotypes were associated with abnormal expression of three heart-chamber markers including cmlc2, amhc and vmhc, and abnormal expression of myogenic regulatory factors including myod and myog. These data suggest that Smyd3 plays an important role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle. We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. We find both smyd3 and setd7 are highly expressed within developing zebrafish heart and knock-down of these genes led to severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis without altering the expressions pattern of heart markers, including cmlc2, vmhc, and amhc. Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish. SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, and SMYD4 have been found to play critical roles in carcinogenesis and/or the development of heart and skeletal muscle.

54c90dabf693c3b16b000004	Which genes have been proposed as potential candidates for gene therapy of heart failure?	The molecular abnormalities underlying HF are discussed along with potential targets for gene therapy, focusing on SERCA2a. The aim of this study was to improve cardiac function in chronic HF by overexpressing constitutively active inhibitor-1 (I-1c)  In summary, I-1c overexpression using BNP116 improves cardiac function in a clinically relevant model of ischemic HF. therapeutic activation of YAP or its downstream targets, potentially through AAV-mediated gene therapy, may be a strategy to improve outcome after MI calcium up-regulation by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart failure patients.  Survivin gene therapy can attenuate the progression of LV systolic dysfunction in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Heart failure-inducible molecular targeting of PP1Î² has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for heart failure. The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a), along with the start of more recent phase 1 trials, opens a new era for gene therapy for the treatment of heart failure. Our results present a strong rationale for a clinical trial of S100A1 gene therapy for human heart failure that could potentially complement current strategies to treat end-stage heart failure. S100A1, a positive inotropic regulator of myocardial contractility, becomes depleted in failing cardiomyocytes in humans and animals, and myocardial-targeted S100A1 gene transfer rescues cardiac contractile function by restoring sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca(2+)) handling in acutely and chronically failing hearts in small animal models. Use of gene therapy for heart failure is gaining momentum as a result of the recent successful completion of phase II of the Calcium Upregulation by Percutaneous Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease (CUPID) trial, which showed clinical safety and efficacy of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a). The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the cardiac sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump (SERCA2a) has the potential to open a new era for gene therapy for heart failure. The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a) has the potential to open a new era for gene therapy in the treatment of heart failure. AIMS: Impaired myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) activity is a hallmark of failing hearts, and SERCA2a gene therapy improves cardiac function in animals and patients with heart failure (HF).

Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates To trace the history of non-coding elements, which may represent candidate ancestral cis-regulatory modules affirmed during chordate evolution, we have searched for conserved elements in tunicate and vertebrate (Olfactores) genomes. We identified, for the first time, 183 non-coding sequences that are highly conserved between the two groups In a recent study that identified highly evolutionary conserved sequences in three genomes of Diptera species we described an ultraconserved element found at an internal exon-intron junction of the Drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene that appeared to be involved in the control of hth pre-mRNA splicing We have explored the distributions of fully conserved ungapped blocks in genome-wide pair-wise alignments of recently completed species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces.

52d832dd98d0239505000003	List phosphorylation consensus motifs for Casein Kinase 1 (CK1)?

5319abffb166e2b80600002f	Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?	Moreover, recent studies have shown that most EMT cases are regulated by soluble growth factors or cytokines. Among these factors, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) execute diverse functions by binding to and activating members of the FGF receptor (FGFR) family, including FGFR1-4. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is an oncoprotein that is involved in tumorigenesis, and PD173074 is known to be a selective inhibitor of FGFR1. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was also overexpressed in EMT cell lines compared with non-EMT cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of HOC313 cells with PD173074 suppressed cellular proliferation and invasion and reduced ERK1/2 and p38 activation. In addition, the expression levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), whose genes contain activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter sites, as well as Snail1 and Snail2 were reduced following PD173074 treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that PD173074 inhibits the MAPK pathway, which regulates the activity of AP-1 and induces MET. egulation of Na,K-ATPase Î²1-subunit in TGF-Î²2-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells The EMT process is mediated via exposure to vitreous cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-Î²2. Previous studies have shown that Na,K-ATPase is required for maintaining a normal polarized epithelial phenotype and that decreased Na,K-ATPase function and subunit levels are associated with TGF-Î²1-mediated EMT in kidney cells. loss of Na,K-ATPase Î²1 is a potential contributor to TGF-Î²2-mediated EMT in RPE cells. MT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) is crucial for cancer cells to acquire invasive phenotypes. In A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, TGF-Î² elicited EMT in Smad-dependent manner and TNF-Î± accelerated this process, as confirmed by cell morphology, expression of EMT markers, capacity of gelatin lysis and cell invasion. Comprehensive expression analysis unraveled genes differentially regulated by TGF-Î² and TNF-Î±, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and ECM (extracellular matrices), suggesting the drastic change in autocrine/paracrine signals as well as cell-to-ECM interactions.  Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness. Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis. SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1. These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance. GF-Î²-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition The cytokine TGF-Î², which is expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, stands out as a master regulator of the pro-invasive tumor microenvironment. TGF-Î² cooperates with stem cell pathways, such as Wnt and Ras signaling, to induce EMT. In addition, TGF-Î² contributes to an EMT-permissive microenvironment by switching the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which thereby mount pro-invasive and pro-metastatic immune responses. In this review, we discuss the role of TGF-Î²-induced EMT as a link between cancer and inflammation in the context of questions, which from our point of view are key to answer in order to understand the functionality of EMT in tumors. ranscription factors c-Myc and CDX2 mediate E-selectin ligand expression in colon cancer cells undergoing EGF/bFGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition Treatment of HT29 and DLD-1 cells with EGF and/or basic FGF (bFGF) induced EMT and significantly increased sLe(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced E-selectin binding activity. Upon hypoxia, TGFÎ² addition or EGFRvIII expression, MCF7, A549 and NMuMG epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts. Expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin decreased, whereas mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin increased. The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression. Transforming growth factor-beta-induced tubular cell EMT in C1.1 cells was inhibited by MMP-2/9 inhibitor. Our in vitro study provides evidence that MMPs, specifically MMP-9, secreted by effector macrophages can induce tubular cell EMT and thereby contribute to renal fibrosis. nflammatory cytokines augments TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells by up-regulating TbetaR-I In this study, we report that cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) significantly enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells as evidenced by acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of E-cadherin, and reorganization of F-actin. IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone can also augment TGF-beta1-induced EMT. However, a combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or the cytomix is more potent to induce EMT. These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with TGF-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. TGF-beta stimulated epithelial to mesenchyme transdifferentiation (EMT) in the presence of TGF-alpha, as characterized by increased expression of fibronectin and changes in TGF-beta receptor binding. EMT is typically induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and inhibited by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Exposure of MDCK cells to 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 72 h induced EMT as evidenced by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of E-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin. In contrast, Akt1 down-regulation in IGF-IR-stimulated cells promoted dramatic neomorphic effects characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced cell migration induced by IGF-I or EGF stimulation. The phenotypic effects of Akt1 down-regulation were accompanied by enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation, which contributed to the induction of migration and EMT. ransforming growth factors beta (TGF-betas) inhibit growth of epithelial cells and induce differentiation changes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ha-Ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) to cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by spindle-like cell morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers. IGF-II induces rapid beta-catenin relocation to the nucleus during epithelium to mesenchyme transition We can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition; Based on the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during EMT. The NBT-II rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to FGF-1 and EGF, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) when cultured at subconfluency. EMT requires continuous TGFbeta receptor (TGFbeta-R) and oncogenic Ras signaling and is stabilized by autocrine TGFbeta production EMT seems to be a close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between TGFbeta-R and Raf/MAPK signaling	[['fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)'], ['TGF-Î²1'], ['TGF-Î²2'], ['TNF-Î±'], ['CCN family'], ['Sonic Hedgehog (SHh)'], ['Notch1'], ['GF-Î²'], ['Wnt'], ['EGF'], ['bFGF'], ['IGF-I'], ['IGF-II']]

A postmarketing surveillance study reported gabapentin treatment failure as a consequence of rash in 0.4% of 3000 patients. The product monograph does not mention rash in children. This case, and limited literature data, suggest that gabapentin may cause rash that is severe enough to necessitate discontinuation in a small percentage of children. Further research is needed to determine the actual incidence and severity of gabapentin-related rash in this population. Five patients treated in the Children's Hospital Pain Control Service for intractable neuropathic pain were included in gabapentin treatment We noticed a rapid improvement, in 1 week, of our patients' VAS scores (from 9 or 10 to 4 or 3) with minimal adverse effects The charts of all children given gabapentin for seizures were reviewed. Only 8 children (7%) reported adverse effects, and the drug was discontinued in two. A postmarketing surveillance study of gabapentin as add-on therapy for 3,100 patients in England. The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were children. The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and reported as suspected ADRs. We reviewed the reports in the literature on the safety, adverse effects and tolerance of GBP as treatment, used as monotherapy or associated with other drugs, in epilepsies in patients of all age groups, including children, adults and the elderly GBP is a well tolerated drug when used for monotherapy or associated with other antiepileptic drugs. The commonest adverse effects seen were somnolence, fainting, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor and headache. However, their incidence was low and intensity mild. There was no clear relationship between the dose given and appearance of side effects, except for fainting and somnolence. GBP is a drug which is free of unwanted side effects. Its safety and tolerability profile is excellent for treatment of simple and complex partial crises, with or without generalization in epileptic patients of all ages. Two studies were conducted to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in healthy subjects age 1 month to 12 years and to guide dose selection in safety and efficacy trials in pediatric patients Single doses of gabapentin were well tolerated by healthy pediatric subjects. The efficacy and safety of gabapentin as add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures in 237 children, aged 3 to 12 years were evaluated over a 6-month period. Thirteen patients (5%) withdrew during the 6-month period because of adverse events. Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentin Of the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group. Twenty-six children with intellectual disability and six normal children, all suffering from refractory partial seizures, received open-label gabapentin (range = 10-50 mg kg(-1) day(-1); mean = 26.7 mg kg(-1) day(-1) as an add-on medication to their antiepileptic drug regimen In the present patient population, patients younger than 10 years of age, all of whom had intellectual disability, were more likely to have side-effects than those older than 10 years of age. Observed adverse effects, which were generally mild, occurred in patients with baseline intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder and behavioural problems. Behavioural adverse effects warranted discontinuation of the medication in only three patients. The severity of intellectual disability (mild versus moderate or severe) did not affect the extent of the response or the occurrence of side-effects. However, children with intellectual disability who also are less than 10 years of age with baseline attention deficit appear to be at a higher risk of behavioural side-effects. Efficacy and safety of gabapentin monotherapy were evaluated in 33 children with newly diagnosed absence epilepsy Somnolence and dizziness were the only adverse events reported by at least two patients during gabapentin treatment. No clinically important changes in laboratory assessments or other safety parameters were observed. Thirty-two children with refractory partial epilepsy received open-label gabapentin as an additional medication to their antiepileptic drug regimen The major reported side effects were behavioral. These consisted of hyperactivity, irritability, and agitation that occurred in patients with baseline mental retardation with attention deficit. We report 2 children who received GBP for intractable seizures and who developed intolerable aggressive behavior requiring dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Behavioral changes should be recognized as a possible side effect of GBP, especially in mentally retarded children. We report 7 children who received gabapentin (GBP) as adjunctive medic ation and subsequently developed behavioral side effects. These behavioral changes consisted of intensification of baseline behaviors as well as new behavioral problems. Behaviors that parents considered most troublesome were tantrums, aggression directed toward others, hyperactivity, and defiance. All behavioral changes were reversible and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of GBP. All children had baseline attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental delays. We described 3 learning disabled children, 1 aged 7 and 2 aged 10 years, with intractable partial seizures who developed severe behavioral problems while receiving modest doses of GBP. The children became hyperactive and had explosive outburst consisting of aggressive and oppositional behavior. The behavioral problems were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of GBP despite moderately improved seizure control.

515de748298dcd4e51000023	List all approved indications for Glivec	The limited available experience suggests that imatinib could be considered as an individualized treatment approach in severe SSc and underscores the need to identify markers for selecting particular patients, who will safely respond to therapeutic inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon cutaneous neoplasm Moreover, even when surgery is utilized, there are cases where positive margins remain, in which case imatinib would be an option, often in combination with surgery. Imatinib can decrease tumor size preoperatively and help to improve postsurgical aesthetic appearance and minimize functional impairment. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Treatment with adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection of localized Kit-positive GIST, the most recent FDA-approved indication (December 2008), has been shown to significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with surgical resection alone Currently, there are no clinical recommendations regarding how to incorporate imatinib drug plasma monitoring in patients with either chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors, indications for which imatinib is approved. Imatinib was effective against GIST that were positive for KIT protein The introduction of alternative therapies, such as imatinib for CML, has challenged well-established indications. More micro-GIST are discovered with the development of investigations, rising the question of wait and see policy for some of them. In locally advanced inoperable patients and metastatic patients, Imatinib is the standard treatment. The introduction of alternative therapies has challenged well-established indications such as imatinib for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals East Manruer, NJ) received accelerated approval on May 10, 2001 for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in (a) chronic phase after failure of IFN-alpha therapy, (b) accelerated phase, and (c) blast crisis. Gleevec (imatinib mesylate), a highly promising new drug for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, in accelerated phase, and in chronic phase after interferon failure or intolerance, received orphan drug status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development on January 31, 2001, and accelerated approval from the FDA for the above three indications on May 10, 2001. Imatinib is the first effective systemic therapy for advanced GIST.	[['Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)'], ['Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)'], ['Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)']]
58da14178acda34529000011	List the human acrocentric chromosomes that are involved in Robertsonian translocation.	Sperm segregation analysis of a (13;22) Robertsonian translocation carrier by FISH: a comparison of locus-specific probe and whole chromosome painting. The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes. Most of the meiotic segregation studies of human Robertsonian translocations have been performed on common t(13;14) and t(14;21) translocations.  Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common chromosomal rearrangements in humans. ROBs are whole-arm rearrangements between the acrocentric chromosomes 13-15, 21, and 22. ROBs can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations).  Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common rearrangements in humans, contributing significantly to genetic imbalance, fetal wastage, mental retardation and birth defects. Rob(14q21q) and rob(13q14q), which are formed predominantly during female meiosis, comprise the majority (approximately 85%) of all ROBs. Previous studies have shown that the breakpoints are consistently located within specific regions of the proximal short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 21.  To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q).  Chromosome 22, most probably, is the only chromosome where chAB4 is found in the direct neighbourhood of the centromere. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of metaphase chromosomes of carriers of rob(21q22q) revealed breakpoint diversity for this rare type of Robertsonian translocation chromosome.  This process is suggested for the evolution of an alpha satellite subfamily recently found on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations. The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes. Homologous alpha satellite sequences on human acrocentric chromosomes with selectivity for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21: implications for recombination between nonhomologues and Robertsonian translocations. Out of 21 structural chromosomal anomalies and polymorphic variants, six deletions and microdeletions, four situations with abnormal long "p" arm of acrocentric chromosomes, two duplications, two reciprocal translocations, two inversions, two additions, one Robertsonian translocation associating trisomy 13, one 9q heteromorphism and one complex chromosome rearrangement were noticed The purpose of this study was to search for cytologic evidence of robertsonian translocation formation that involves chromosomes 14q and 21q in human oogenesis with the use of dual color fluorescent in situ hybridization with whole chromosome paints.The oocytes from a chromosomally normal fetus at 23.5 weeks of gestation underwent cohybridization with chromosome specific DNA libraries from chromosomes 14 and 21 The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes Homologous alpha satellite sequences on human acrocentric chromosomes with selectivity for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21: implications for recombination between nonhomologues and Robertsonian translocations.

5a6a2dcab750ff4455000023	Which are the constitutive parts of a Genomic Regulatory Block (GRB)?	We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated "bystander" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs).

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcription coactivator, is the major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which plays a critical role in organ size control and cancer development YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) are major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway that influences tissue homeostasis, organ size, and cancer development.  The Hippo signaling pathway converges on YAP to regulate growth, differentiation, and regeneration. Yes associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are its targets and terminal effectors: inhibition of the pathway promotes YAP/TAZ translocation to the nucleus, where they interact with transcriptional enhancer associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors and coactivate the expression of target genes, promoting cell proliferation.

56cf2be73975bb303a000005	What do mepolizumab and reslizumab have in common?	The most promising agents are targeted against cytokines of Th2 pattern and related receptors, such as IL-2 (daclizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab) or IL-5 in patients with hypereosinophilia (mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab). Patients with severe asthma or COPD have often a suboptimal symptom control due to inadequate treatment.  For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events. Safety data for reslizumab, another anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, and benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody to the IL-5 receptor Î±-chain, are comparatively limited, especially for benralizumab, although reports of administration of these antibodies to humans suggest that they are well tolerated. IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8). In patients with severe, refractory asthma associated with eosinophilia, however, clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in asthma exacerbations. Clinical studies in other disorders, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome, have also shown significant improvements in blood and/or tissue eosinophilia and variable alterations in clinical disease activity. Strategies aimed at the inhibition of IL-5 may hold great promise in the treatment of eosinophilic diseases. Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). Both antibodies have demonstrated the ability to reduce blood and tissue eosinophil counts.  Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). To date, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been developed that bind to human IL-5. Monoclonal antibodies directed towards interleukin-5, such as mepolizumab or reslizumab, were shown to be very effective at reducing blood and airways eosinophilia. IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).

Recently, our group described gain-of-function mutations in the PCNA-binding site of CDKN1C that result in an undergrowth syndrome called IMAGe Syndrome (Intrauterine Growth Restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia, and Genital anomalies), with life-threatening consequences.  IMAGe syndrome is an exceedingly rare condition first described in 1999. Components of the syndrome are intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia and genital anomalies.  OBJECTIVE: Arboleda et al. have recently shown that IMAGe (intra-uterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital abnormalities) syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of maternally expressed gene CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5.  Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies).

PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade Bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of DNA replication encode two DNA polymerases III, DnaE and PolC, rather than a single one. SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC-PolE DNA polymerases We conclude that PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE, which may play a direct role in the maintenance of SGD. Furthermore, SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) In contrast, PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade, suggesting at least two origins for the degradosome.

APOBEC3G oligomerization is associated with the inhibition of both Alu and LINE-1 retrotransposition We have previously demonstrated that antiretroviral restriction factors, human APOBEC3 (hA3) proteins (A-H), differentially inhibit L1 retrotransposition In this present study, we found that hA3 members also restrict Alu retrotransposition at differential levels that correlate with those observed previously for L1 inhibition Modulation of LINE-1 and Alu/SVA retrotransposition by Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome-related SAMHD1 Here, we demonstrate that the Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome gene product SAMHD1, recently revealed to be an inhibitor of HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infectivity and neutralized by the viral Vpx protein, is also a potent regulator of LINE-1 and LINE-1-mediated Alu/SVA retrotransposition We also found that mutant SAMHD1s of Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome patients are defective in LINE-1 inhibition SAMHD1 inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition in dividing cells we found that the predominantly nuclear A3B only weakly restricted infection by HIV-1, HIV-1Îvif, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), while significantly inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition The chimeric construct A3G/B, in which the first 60 amino acids of A3B were replaced with those of A3G, restricted HIV-1, HIV-1Îvif, and HTLV-1 infection, as well as LINE-1 retrotransposition Expression of cellular A3 proteins is sufficient for inhibition of L1 and Alu retrotransposition, but the effect of A3 proteins transferred in exosomes on retroelement mobilization is unknown. Inhibition of LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition by exosomes encapsidating APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F. APOBEC3G oligomerization is associated with the inhibition of both Alu and LINE-1 retrotransposition. Previous studies revealed that the overexpression of some A3 proteins could restrict engineered human Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition in HeLa cells. APOBEC3 proteins inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition in the absence of ORF1p binding. We concluded that APOBEC3 proteins interfere indirectly with the LINE-1 retrotransposition pathway, probably through interference with RNA targeting. Expression of cellular A3 proteins is sufficient for inhibition of L1 and Alu retrotransposition, but the effect of A3 proteins transferred in exosomes on retroelement mobilization is unknown Here, we demonstrate that the Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome gene product SAMHD1, recently revealed to be an inhibitor of HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infectivity and neutralized by the viral Vpx protein, is also a potent regulator of LINE-1 and LINE-1-mediated Alu/SVA retrotransposition Human cytidine deaminases, including APOBEC3G (A3G) and A3F, are part of a cellular defense system against retroviruses and retroelements including non-LTR retrotransposons LINE-1 (L1) and Alu SAMHD1 inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition in dividing cells Expression of cellular A3 proteins is sufficient for inhibition of L1 and Alu retrotransposition, but the effect of A3 proteins transferred in exosomes on retroelement mobilization is unknown Selective inhibition of Alu retrotransposition by APOBEC3G. Our data further indicate that APOBEC3G recognizes 7SL RNA and Alu RNA by its common structure, the Alu domain, suggesting a mechanism for APOBEC3G- mediated inhibition of Alu retrotransposition Functional analysis and structural modeling of human APOBEC3G reveal the role of evolutionarily conserved elements in the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and Alu transposition.

588f220e3b87a8a73800000d	List available circular RNA prediction tools.	CircRNAs are novel members of the non-coding RNA family. For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated. Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions.

570a6d03cf1c325851000025	List sclerostin interaction partners.	 Several previously unidentified full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, gremlin-1, fetuin A, midkine, annexin A1 and A2, and collagen Î±1, which have established roles in bone formation or resorption processes, were bound to the sclerostin-MBP amylose resin but not to the MBP amylose resin. Other full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as casein kinase II and secreted frizzled related protein 4 that modulate Wnt signaling were identified. Several peptides derived from proteins such as Phex, asporin and follistatin that regulate bone metabolism also bound sclerostin.  We identified an interaction between sclerostin and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3. Sclerostin, SOST, the gene affected in this disease, has been postulated to exert its activity by functioning as a BMP antagonist. However, recent evidence indicates that SOST is highly related to Wise, which can also modulate the Wnt pathway by binding to LRP5 and LRP6. Bone density ligand, Sclerostin, directly interacts with LRP5 but not LRP5G171V to modulate Wnt activity. We show that recombinant sclerostin and noggin bound to each other with high affinity (K(D) = 2.92 nm).

It was reported that DP could induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer, human gastric tumor cells and human melanoma, but the cytotoxic effect of DP on human breast cancer was not investigated. CONCLUSION: Therefore DP was a candidate for anti-breast cancer, DP induced apoptosis of MCF-7 through mitochondrial pathway. Dracorhodin perchlorate has been recently shown to induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown in human gastric tumor cells. Dracorhodin perchlorate suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. The growth inhibition and pro-apoptosis effects of dracorhodin perchlorate on human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line were examined.  Dracorhodin perchlorate, an anthocyanin red pigment, induces human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell death through apoptotic pathway.  Dracorhodin perchlorate, an anthocyanin red pigment, induces human melanoma A375-S2 cell death through the apoptotic pathway.  Dracorhodin perchlorate inhibited proliferation of several tumor cell lines.

54d77bdf3706e89528000019	List chromosomes that have been linked to Arnold Chiari syndrome in the literature.	Consistent with a genetic hypothesis for CMI, much of the PF morphology was found to be heritable and multiple genomic regions were strongly implicated from OSA, including regions on Chromosomes 1 (LOD = 3.07, p = 3 Ã 10(-3) ) and 22 (LOD = 3.45, p = 6 Ã 10(-5) ) containing several candidates warranting further investigation. Furthermore, we report the first case of documented Arnold-Chiari malformation type I and increased factor XIII activity associated with 6p trisomy.  Of particular interest were two regions (Chr8, Max LODâ=â3.04; Chr12, Max LODâ=â2.09) identified within the subset of "CTD-negative" families, both of which harbor growth differentiation factors (GDF6, GDF3) implicated in the development of Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS). Moreover, the performed DNA analysis showed interstitial duplication in chromosome 5 (5q35.1).  CGH microarray showed a approximately 520.7 kb microdeletion on 16p13.3 involving CREBBP, ADCY9, and SRL genes.  Pentasomy 49,XXXXY associated with a Chiari type 1 malformation and cervical syrinx. A 13-year-old with pentasomy 49,XXXXY and a Chiari type 1 malformation with an associated cervical syrinx is presented. Phenotypic definition of Chiari type I malformation coupled with high-density SNP genome screen shows significant evidence for linkage to regions on chromosomes 9 and 15. Two-point LOD scores on chromosome 15 reached 3.3 and multipoint scores in this region identified a 13 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (15q21.1-22.3).  Multipoint LOD scores on chromosome 9 maximized at 3.05, identifying a 40 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (9q21.33-33.1) and a tighter region with multipoint LOD scores over 2 that was only 8.5 cM.  In addition, this child had an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation that required surgical decompression. FISH studies using BAC clones spanning the 5q15 to 5q22 region revealed that these were all present in both homologues.  The karyotype showed 46, XY, del(1)(q23q31.2).  Karyotype analysis showed inversion of Y chromosome.  The clinical features and morphological findings in 31 Japanese infants with trisomy 18 are presented. The majority were small-for-date infants. There was no sex predominance in our series, as opposed to male:female ratios of 1:3 reported in the literature. The average age at death was greater in females than in males. Cardiovascular anomalies were consistently present; ventricular septar defect and patent ductus arteriosus being the most common malformations. Various other internal malformations including the Arnold-Chiari malformation were observed. An unusual heterotopia of striated skeletal muscle and glial tissue occurred in the pontine meninges of a stillborn male showing feature of trisomy 13 and an Arnold-Chiari malformation. Type II Arnold-Chiari malformation with normal spine in trisomy 18. A variety of anomalies of the central nervous system are observed in trisomy 18. The present case describes an infant having a type II Arnold-Chiari malformation without spina bifida. One previous case of an Arnold-Chiari malformation was reported in trisomy 18 but that infant also had a lumbar meningomyelocoele.  Recently, a child was reported who presented with a 3p13-14.1 deletion of four genes, including FOXP1, and a constellation of deficits that included speech delay. In this study, we report the case of a patient with a single deletion of FOXP1. This patient presented with speech and motor developmental delays, a Chiari I malformation, and epileptiform discharges.

5162c8a8298dcd4e51000047	What are the known families of deadenylases?	Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain On the other hand, the interaction between CNOT7 and BTG2, a member of the antiproliferative BTG/Tob family involved in transcription and mRNA decay appears less important for proliferation of MCF7 cells, suggesting that CNOT7 does not function solely in conjunction with BTG2. The Tob/BTG family is a group of antiproliferative proteins containing two highly homologous regions, Box A and Box B. These proteins all associate with CCR4-associated factor 1 (Caf1), which belongs to the ribonuclease D (RNase D) family of deadenylases and is a component of the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex. The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA. CCR4, an evolutionarily conserved member of the CCR4-NOT complex, is the main cytoplasmic deadenylase. It contains a C-terminal nuclease domain with homology to the endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family of enzymes. The yeast Pop2 protein, belonging to the eukaryotic Caf1 family, is required for mRNA deadenylation in vivo. Although CAF1 protein belongs to the DEDDh family of RNases, CCR4 appears to be the principle deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex. Like CCR4, increased length of RNA substrates converted mCAF1 into a processive enzyme. In contrast to two other DEDD family members, PAN2 and PARN, mCAF1 was not activated either by PAB1 or capped RNA substrates. The domain has the fold of the DnaQ family and represents the first structure of an RNase from the DEDD superfamily. The evolutionarily conserved CCR4 protein, which is part of the cytoplasmic deadenylase, contains a C-terminal domain that displays homology to an Mg2+-dependent DNase/phosphatase family of proteins. These results establish that CCR4 and most probably other members of a widely distributed CCR4-like family of proteins constitute a novel class of RNA-DNA exonucleases. Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product. Shortening and removal of the 3' poly(A) tail of mature mRNA by poly(A)-specific 3' exonucleases (deadenylases) is the initial and often rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation. PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells.

5e30f8abfbd6abf43b000047	Which molecules are inhibited by Gilteritinib?	ASP2215 (gilteritinib) is a novel, dual FLT3/AXL inhibitor with promising early phase trial data (NCT02014558).  Ex vivo exposure (n = 30) to FLT3 inhibitors, in particular to the FLT3-specific inhibitor gilteritinib, showed that colony-forming capacity was significantly more reduced in FLT3-ITD-AR â¥ 0.5 compared with ITD-AR-low and ITD- patient samples (P < .001).  Furthermore, overexpression of Pim-1 in 32D/TKD enhanced the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway and partially protected it from the PI3K/Akt inhibitors or the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib to confer the resistance to PI3K/Akt inhibitors.  Finally, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 80 patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed/refractory AML participating in a trial of a novel FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, and demonstrated a relationship between the mutation burden, as detected by the assay, and overall survival.  Gilteritinib, a novel, highly specific, potent fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/AXL inhibitor, demonstrated antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Combinations of an AXL inhibitor, cabozantinib or gilteritinib, and an EGFR-TKI were more effective against HCC78R cells than monotherapy with an EGFR-TKI or AXL inhibitor.  Internal tandem duplication (ITD) in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Quizartinib, gilteritinib, and midostaurin are inhibitors against FLT3-ITD that have good efficacy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients.  In this review, we summarized the preclinical and clinical studies on new FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib, lestaurtinib, sunitinib, tandutinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib, crenolanib, cabozantinib, Sel24-B489, G-749, AMG 925, TTT-3002, and FF-10101.

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

In contrast to other FLT3 inhibitors, FL stimulation had little effect on growth inhibition or apoptosis induction by gilteritinib. Here, we investigated the effect of FL on the efficacy of gilteritinib, a FLT3 inhibitor, in AML-derived cells in vitro and in mice. Gilteritinib, a FLT3/AXL inhibitor, shows antileukemic activity in mouse models of FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The decreased FLT3 activity and high intratumor distribution of gilteritinib translated to tumor regression and improved survival in xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation models of FLT3-driven AML. These results indicate that gilteritinib may be an important next-generation FLT3 inhibitor for use in the treatment of FLT3 mutation-positive AML. Gilteritinib (XospataÂ®) is an orally available small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Astellas Pharma in collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) harbouring FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations. Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). Gilteritinib is approved in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Gilteritinib is an oral, potent, selective FLT3 inhibitor with single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. The highly potent and selective FLT3 kinase inhibitor gilteritinib is the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Gilteritinib is a highly-specific, potent FLT3/AXL inhibitor with demonstrated activity against FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations.

To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear. We suggest that a 3T MRI measurement should be carried out in patients with sensory-neural hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, 4 h after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-contrast agent to verify the inner ear pathology.  Eleven of the 17425 veterans appeared to have typical MÃ©niÃ¨re's Disease. Their symptoms included attacks of vertigo, lasting between half an hour and a few hours and no more than 24 hours; the sensation of aural fullness; and tinnitus accompanied by a fluctuating or permanent low-tone hearing loss.  Diagnosis of MeniÃ¨re's Disease is based upon the wellknown labyrinthic syndrome (hypoacusia, tinnitus and dizziness) which manifests with the typical abscessual, recurrent and unforeseeable course.  Typical clinical manifestations of MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group. Among 93 patients presenting the typical symptoms of a MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease associating an unilateral fluctuating hearing loss of sensorineural type, tinnitus and vertiginous attacks lasting minutes to hours, 40 patients (43%) presented in their personal history a particular otologic insult in the ear which later on developed into the full MÃ©niÃ¨re's symptomatology, or a particular systemic disease with otologic manifestations.  Fourteen children (aged 14 years or younger) with typical MÃ©niÃ¨re's triad with cochlear sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent vertigo attacks lasting from minutes to hours were investigated in four different neuro-otologic centers.

Nine children, labeled as having "idiopathic MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease," developed the auditory and vestibular symptoms without any detectable causative factor. To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear.Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups.Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish MÃ©niÃ¨re Association in Finland. In each twin pair, one twin had migraine and MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, whereas the other experienced migraine and episodic vertigo without auditory symptoms.The frequent association of episodic vertigo, migraine, and MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease in closely related individuals, including identical twins supports the heritability of a migraine-MÃ©niÃ¨re's syndrome, with variable expression of the individual features of hearing loss, episodic vertigo, and migraine headaches. There has been literature, beginning with MÃ©niÃ¨re himself, suggesting a relationship between MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease and migraine-associated dizziness. In the characterizations of the migraine-associated dizziness, the signs and symptoms show overlap with those characterizing Meniere's disease.

In this study, we propose a novel algorithm for extracting PPIs from literature which consists of two phases. First, we automatically categorize the data into subsets based on its semantic properties and extract candidate PPI pairs from these subsets. Second, we apply support vector machines (SVMs) to classify candidate PPI pairs using features specific for each subset. The source code and scripts used in this article are available for academic use at http://staff.science.uva.nl/~bui/PPIs.zip We describe a system for the detection of mentions of protein-protein interactions in the biomedical scientific literature.

This interaction requires the RPC components Mrc1 and Ctf4, both of which associate with a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain located at the amino terminus of Dia2 Here we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks We found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components Here, we show that the RPC associates with DNA polymerase alpha that primes each Okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha Others have found recently that the Mrc1 subunit of RPCs binds DNA polymerase epsilon, which synthesises the leading strand at DNA replication forks we show that the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex allows the MCM (minichromosome maintenance) helicase to interact with key regulatory proteins in large replisome progression complexes (RPCs) that are assembled during initiation and disassembled at the end of S phase RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion. RPCs also interact with Mcm10 and topoisomerase I During initiation, GINS is essential for a specific subset of RPC proteins to interact with MCM. GINS is also important for the normal progression of DNA replication forks, and we show that it is required after initiation to maintain the association between MCM and Cdc45 within RPCs We found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components. Here we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks [6]. Compared with wild type, hydroxyurea-treated ctf18Ð¶Ð´ cells exhibited increased chromatin association of replisome progression complex components including Cdc45, Ctf4, and GINS complex subunits, the polymerase processivity clamp PCNA and the single-stranded DNA-binding complex RPA. The amino-terminal TPR domain of Dia2 tethers SCF(Dia2) to the replisome progression complex. Ctf4 is a protein conserved in eukaryotes and a constituent of the replisome progression complex. Eukaryotic GINS also links with other key proteins at the fork to maintain an active replisome progression complex. Dia2 has previously been implicated in the control of replication and genome stability via its interaction with the replisome progression complex. The Cdc45-MCM-GINS complex could constitute the core of a larger macromolecular structure that has been termed the "replisome progression complex". FACT does not associate with the Mcm2-7 helicase at replication origins during G1 phase but is subsequently incorporated into the replisome progression complex independently of histone binding and uniquely among histone chaperones. Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha. Replisome progression complex links DNA replication to sister chromatid cohesion in Xenopus egg extracts. On the basis of the physical interactions between AND-1 and DNA polymerases, we discuss a model to describe how replisome progression complex establishes sister chromatid cohesion. The components of the replisome that preserve genomic stability by controlling the progression of eukaryotic DNA replication forks are poorly understood. RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion.

55086ea1098a1b487b000001	Matuzumab has been tested for treatment of which cancers?	 Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been studied in phase II trials. A phase I pharmacokinetic study of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This phase I study investigated the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Matuzumab combined with paclitaxel was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC.  This article focuses on anti-Her-2 therapy, specifically trastuzumab, as well as other epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists such as cetuximab, panitumub, matuzumab, nimotzumab, gefitinib, and erlotinib. Phase I study of matuzumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in patients with advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two different weekly doses of the fully humanized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with high-dose 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-positive advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been evaluated in phase II trials.  Pemetrexed with or without matuzumab as second-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: This randomized phase II study investigated pemetrexed in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab compared with pemetrexed alone as second-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  Matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) compared with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer: a randomised, multicentre open-label phase II study. BACKGROUND: Clinical data showed promising antitumour activity with feasible tolerability for matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) chemotherapy in untreated advanced oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer.   CONCLUSION: Matuzumab 800 mg weekly combined with ECX chemotherapy does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced OG cancer. In all studies, the patients had different types of advanced carcinoma - mainly colon, rectal and pancreatic cancer. They received matuzumab as multiple 1-hour intravenous infusions in a wide range of dosing regimens (development dataset: from 400 mg every 3 weeks to 2000 mg in the first week followed by 1600 mg weekly; evaluation dataset: from 100 mg weekly to 800 mg weekly).   Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, and ch806, are in different stages of development for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Molecular determinants of response to matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have proven to be effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that express EGFR. We recently published a phase I study of weekly matuzumab plus paclitaxel. Our data suggest that EGFR expression and KRAS mutation status is predictive for clinical response to matuzumab +/- paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. Phase I study of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine plus matuzumab in previously untreated patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the humanised antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) in patients as first-line treatment for advanced oesophagogastric cancer that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Therefore, these first successes led to the development of several drugs including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, panitumumab, matuzumab), TK inhibitors targeting one receptor as well as TK pan-inhibitors (lapatinib, HKI 272, PKI 166, EKB-569, AEE-788), currently assessed through clinical trials worldwide. Antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor in non small cell lung cancer: current status of matuzumab and panitumumab. Matuzumab and panitumumab are antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that are being evaluated in several malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In phase I trials of single-agent matuzumab in patients with EGFR-positive cancer, three tumor responses were documented in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well as colorectal carcinoma. A phase II trial of EMD72000 (matuzumab), a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated. In this population of very heavily pretreated patients with epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies, there was no evidence of significant clinical activity when matuzumab was administered as monotherapy. Phase I study of the humanised anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody matuzumab (EMD 72000) combined with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer.  Three groups of chemotherapy-naive advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (n=17) received escalating doses of matuzumab (400 mg weekly, 800 mg biweekly, or 800 mg weekly) and gemcitabine (1000 mg m-2 weekly in weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle).  A phase I study of the humanized monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody EMD 72000 (matuzumab) in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase I study assessed the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the combination of matuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (panitunumab, matuzumab) are currently evaluated.  It is the target for a class of agents at the forefront of development for the treatment of colorectal cancer, ie, the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, which include cetuximab, panitumumab, and matuzumab.  Two other monoclonal antibodies, matuzumab (EMD 72000) and panitumumab (ABG-EGF), also have shown activity against EGFR-expressing CRC but are still in the early stage of clinical development. Matuzumab is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials for gastric, cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.

55451e53bf90a13052000003	Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?	Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription. the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP. We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription. NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively. The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair. Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA. The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins. The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins. Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors Mfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation. Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA E. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation. We also find that the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP We also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP We show that Mfd-dependent TCR in bacteria involves the formation of a damage search complex that can detect lesions downstream of a stalled RNAP, and that the strand specificity of the accelerated repair pathway is independent of the requirement for a lesion to stall RNAP coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins	[['Mfd'], ['NusA']]

54f0920f94afd61504000018	List drugs included in the DHAP-R chemotherapy regiment.	Standard treatment of transplant-eligible patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of rituximab and platinum-based chemotherapy, either ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) or dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP), with autologous transplant consolidation for those with chemosensitive disease. The intergroup Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) set the limits for this standard of treatment after first comparing 2 salvage regimens: rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) and rituximab, dexamethasone, aracytine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).  The response rate (RR) to first salvage chemotherapy was 23% (RR by regimen: dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [DHAP] 15%, etoposide, Solu-Medrol, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [ESHAP] 36%, and gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin [GDP] 45%); 25% (n = 28) of patients underwent ASCT.  PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens based on platinum and cytarabine in association with etoposide and methylprednisolone (ESHAP) or with dexamethasone (DHAP) with or without Rituximab (Â± R) in patients with refractory or a relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).  R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP). Because of the inability to safely administer unattenuated doses of anthracycline-based regimens, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) was used at full doses (along with rituximab for the DLBCL patient) until hepatic function normalized (1-5 cycles).  Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable).  Patients are first randomised between ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, ara-C and cisplatin), both combined with rituximab (R-ICE or R-DHAP). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The treatment of the patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) remains difficult. It was reported that DHAP regimen(cisplatin + Ara-C + dexamthsone) was an effective salvage therapy, but there was no report about it in China.  Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable).

52fc8b772059c6d71c00006e	Which are the known inhibitors of the TPL2/MAP3K8 protein?

The mosaicism was characterized and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or chromosome analysis. Different categories of abnormal cell lines were detected: (1) aneuploidy, including sex chromosome abnormalities and isochromosomes (22 cases), (2) ring or marker chromosomes (12 cases), (3) single deletion/duplication copy number variations (CNVs) (11 cases), (4) multiple deletion/duplication CNVs (5 cases), (5) exonic CNVs (4 cases), and (6) unbalanced translocations (3 cases).  Positive cases with MLPA technique were confirmed using either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or follow up confirmatory MLPA probe sets. The deletions/duplications detected in non telomeric regions include regions for Prader Willi/Angelman regions, Williams syndrome, Smith Magenis syndrome and Velocardiofacial syndrome. The bone marrow specimen from a patient with MDS was comprehensively analyzed by a combination of genomic approaches, including chromosomal karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome scanning using Affymetrix high density SNP microarray platform, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using IonTorrent Cancer Gene Panel. Detection of TET2 abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of TP53 for the detection of chromosome 17 abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can effectively demonstrate TET2 deletions and is often used to validate molecular results.  These findings demonstrate that 1) FISH is an effective and economical method to reveal cryptic abnormalities of band 4q22-q24 resulting in TET2 deletions; FISH and SNP-A karyotyping in myelodysplastic syndromes: improving cytogenetic detection of del(5q), monosomy 7, del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q).  Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N=52), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N=7) and acute myeloid leukemia (N=15) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping.  We conclude that MC, FISH and SNP-A are complementary techniques that, when applied and interpreted together, can improve the diagnostic yield for identifying genetic lesions in MDS and contribute to the better description of abnormal karyotypes. Here, we report the detection of a reciprocal translocation t(7;21)(p22;q22) in the marrow of two adults with MDS and AML, using conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH). Detection of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5,7 and 8 in myelodysplastic syndromes with fluorescence in situ hybridization and its clinical significance To identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases.  FISH detected monosomy 7 in 6 samples at the time MDS was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was diagnosed. As chromosomal instability may contribute to leukemogenesis in patients with congenital bone marrow failure (CBMF) disorders, it was the aim of this study to characterize chromosomally aberrant clones that arise during the clinical course of disease by means of R-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. In one child with congenital thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded. In a girl with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified. Simultaneously, transition into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurred. The brother, who was also afflicted with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration.  In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into MDS or AML and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients. Here we assess this capability by applying array CGH to the analysis of copy number alterations in 44 patients with a phenotype of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Twenty-five patients had the deletion on chromosome 22 characteristic of this syndrome as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  Subtelomeric aberrations previously detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were confirmed in two patients, and accurate diagnosis was provided in two previously undiagnosed complex cases. Microdeletions at 15q11.2-q13 in a newborn with hypotonia, cryptorchidism, and hypopigmentation were detected with few discrepancies between the array results and FISH analysis. Contiguous microdeletion of GSCL, HIRA and TBX1 genes at 22q11.2 was identified in a previously undiagnosed boy with an unusual presentation of the VCF/DiGeorge spectrum.  Detection of 20q(-) chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization The results showed that among 52 cases of MDS, 7 (13.5%) cases were positive by FISH, however, of which, 4 cases were positive and the other 3 cases were negative by CC assay. It is concluded that YAC912C3 and interphase FISH providing a powerful technique in the detection of 20q(-) in MDS is an important complement to CC assay. A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).  FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in all the patients. -7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q-. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies. We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in>80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. We clearly present that the use of SKY combined with conventional G-banding analysis and FISH has assisted in the identification of important chromosomal events that may play a key role in the development of t-MDS. n this study, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as complementary techniques for the analysis of two therapy-related secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) cases with complex karyotypes, previously analyzed by G-banding.  Comparison of detection of trisomy 8 with fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional karyotype analysis in myelodysplastic syndrome The trisomy 8 clones were simultaneously detected in 48 MDS cases with FISH and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). Trisomy 8 was detected in 1 of 15 specimens with normal or abnormal karyotype without trisomy 8 by FISH. In conclusion, our results showed that FISH is a sensitive and accurate technique to detect trisomy 8 in MDS patients. It can provide contribute to diagnosis, assessment of curative effect and predicting progress of disease in MDS.  Detection of common chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome with a panel fluorescence in situ hybridization Panel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in MDS. Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (trisomy 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case) Detection of -5/5q- chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization In 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC). Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in MDS. Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH. Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH.CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in MDS and it is more sensitive than CC. Diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Detection of trisomy 8 with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in myelodysplastic syndromes Interphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome.  Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2.  In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing.  Discordant detection of monosomy 7 by GTG-banding and FISH in a patient with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome without evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of progenitor cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for the detection of cells affected by chromosome abnormality trisomy 8 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We conclude that the combination of FACS/FISH/BUdR, which determines the number, phenotype and proliferation rate of very rare leukaemic cells in patients with AML or MDS in clinical remission, provides information that is useful in the identification of patients with high and low likelihood of relapse. FISH detection of chromosome 15 deletions in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. We conclude that FISH analysis is a rapid and reliable method for detection of deletions within 15q11-q13 and whenever a deletion is found, FISH analysis of parental chromosomes should also be considered. We have evaluated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for the clinical laboratory detection of the 15q11-q13 deletion seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) using probes for loci D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3.  Study of clonality in myelodysplastic syndromes: detection of trisomy 8 in bone marrow cell smears by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Investigations with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrate loss of the telomeres on the reciprocal chromosome in three unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 15 in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with library probes and telomere-specific probes). Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of monosomy 7 in myelodysplastic syndromes. Detection of monosomy 7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome 7 specific alpha satellite DNA probe was used to detect monosomy 7 in interphase and metaphase cells obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). A 15-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by monosomy 7 was cytogenetically evaluated by metaphase karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of interphase cells at six different points during the course of his disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four normal relatives used as controls. These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome.  This study identified cytogenetic abnormalities in a population screened for deletion 22q11.2 syndrome (D22S) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and G-banding and correlated these abnormalities to referring specialty and submitted indications.  Positive test results for D22S FISH and other abnormalities found by other FISH assays and G-banding were correlated to submitting specialist and indication Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the diagnosis of DiGeorge sequence and related diseases. Deletions of 22q11.2 have been detected in the majority of patients with DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes by either cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or Southern blot hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of 5q31 deletion in myelodysplastic syndromes without cytogenetic evidence of 5q-. To explore the value of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique in the detection of the complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).M-FISH was used in ten MDS patients with R-banding CCAs to refine the complex chromosomal rearrangements, the constitute of marker chromosomes, and to identify the cryptic translocations.Thirty-seven kinds of structural rearrangements were detected by M-FISH including insertion, deletion, translocation and derivative chromosomes, among which 34 kinds were unbalanced rearrangements, and 3 were balanced rearrangements including t(6;22) (q21; q12), t(9; 19) (q13; p13) and t(3;5) (?; ?). To explore the clonal evolution of monosomy 7 in patients with aplastic anemia (AA).Monosomy 7 (-7) in 81 AA patients with normal karyotype at diagnosis and 46 AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and more than 6 months of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) were detected by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) retrospectively.There were 5.4% - 7.6% of -7 cells in 11 (13.6%) of 81 patients at diagnosis, the survival and response rate to IST in -7 positive patients did not differ significantly from that in -7 negative patients (P = 0. To compare the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) versus conventional cytogenetics (CC) in the detection of common chromosomal abnormalities and evaluate the significance of FISH in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) .A total of 344 patients with de novo MDS from June 2008 to October 2012 were detected by 6 pairs of probes, including CSF1R/D5S23-D5S721 (5q33) , EGR1/ D5S23-D5S721 (5q31) , D7S486 (7q31) /CSP7, D7S522 (7q31) /CSP7, D20S108/CSP8 (20q12/CSP8) and CSPX/CSPY Unbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21 To evaluate the conventional cytogenetic methods in genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis in the family with a proband of Angelman syndrome (AS).High-resolution G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes were performed.Two AS patients and 1 normal fetus in the family were successfully detected by FISH.Our result demonstrated that patient with type I AS could be detected by combining the techniques of high-resolution G-banding and FISH with clinical observation, which would offer accurate genetic counseling information to the geneticists and provide the prenatal diagnosis for the AS family To investigate the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndrome using chromosome 13/21 alpha satellite probe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on uncultured interphase cells from amniotic fluid.The interphase amniocytes of 10 fetuses who were detected normal and 3 fetus who were detected trisomy by prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis were selected To optimize the prenatal diagnosis platform by using domestically made fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) kit and to explore the clinical application of FISH to rapid prenatal diagnosis of a wide range of chromosomal abnormalities.Amniotic fluid samples from 110 pregnant women were studied with the rapid prenatal diagnosis method of FISH and the conventional cell culture method of karyotyping, the results from both methods were compared.Four cases of trisomy 21, 1 case of trisomy 18, 58 cases of 46, XX, and 47 cases of 46, XY were detected by FISH in the 110 amniotic fluid samples. Implementation of Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method for detecting microdeletion syndromes - our first experiences. Prenatal detection of cri du chat syndrome on uncultured amniocytes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using non-commercial probes in the diagnosis of clinically suspected microdeletion syndromes. Unbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis. FISH with 5p subtelomeric probes and 18p subtelomeric probe further confirmed that the derivative chromosome 5 has derived from a translocation between 5p and 18p, which has given rise to a 46,XY,der(5)t(5;18)(p15.1;p11.31)dn karyotype.A de novo 5p partial deletion in conjunction with a cryptic 18p duplication has been detected in a boy featuring Cri-du-Chat syndrome. We conclude that FISH is a useful, easily applied technique for the diagnosis of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndromes, particularly DGS. In group B (n=79), the 5q deletion had been observed by cytogenetics and was confirmed to be present in all cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31.CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 detected the 5q deletion in 6% of cases without clear evidence of del(5q) by conventional banding cytogenetics. We suggest that fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 should be performed in cases of a suspected '5q- syndrome' and/or if the cytogenetic study shows no metaphases or an aberrant karyotype with chromosome 5 involved (no 5q- chromosome). Although conventional cytogenetics is considered the gold standard to detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is being increasingly used additionally. Cytogenetic aberrations in myelodysplastic syndrome detected by comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. To detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).

516281e6298dcd4e51000040	Global quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses are emerging. List the preferred technologies for the enrichment for phosphorylated peptides?	TiSH--a robust and sensitive global phosphoproteomics strategy employing a combination of TiO2, SIMAC, and HILIC. An initial TiO(2) phosphopeptide pre-enrichment step is followed by post-fractionation using sequential elution from IMAC (SIMAC) to separate multi- and mono-phosphorylated peptides, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) of the mono-phosphorylated peptides (collectively abbreviated "TiSH"). After enrichment by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate proteins. Combining immunoprecipitation with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment, isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide fractionation by strong cation exchange chromatography combined with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment enabled quantification of more than 8000 distinct phosphorylation sites in Ppt1 wild-type versus Ppt1-deficient yeast cells By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins. Our method combines the use of strong cation exchange (SCX) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) for phosphopeptide enrichment, high-resolution MS for peptide and protein identification, and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for quantification. Phosphopeptides were isolated with high specificity through a simple derivatization procedure based on phosphoramidate chemistry.

5a981e66fcd1d6a10c00002f	According to guidelines, insulin resistance is one risk factor in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, name 3 more risk factors.	 Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally defined as a cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors which are often associated with the condition of insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity Metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease in women. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature mortality. The components are abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia.  Abdominal obesity is frequently associated with a collection of metabolic disorders that include elevated blood pressure, characteristic lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides) and increased fasting glucose, with an underlying situation of insulin resistance, which has been defined as metabolic syndrome The presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components (abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and high fasting blood glucose) allows to diagnose metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome has 5 criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, fasting hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose level, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states that promote atherosclerotic CVD and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The metabolic syndrome is a complex association of several risk factors including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and essential hypertension.   insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity.  The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors which predispose an individual to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is general consensus regarding the main components of the syndrome (glucose intolerance, obesity, raised blood pressure and dyslipidaemia [elevated triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol])  Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors - including abdominal obesity, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and elevated blood pressure The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors including glucose dysregulation, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), also termed syndrome X, is a distinctive constellation of risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The syndrome's hallmarks are glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, a characteristic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), obesity, upper-body fat distribution, hypertension, and increased prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic factors "The metabolic syndrome" is the name for a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that are of metabolic origin. These risk factors consist of atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state.  Metabolic Syndrome X is a clinical entity which comprises the following factors: diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, high levels of triglyceride and/or low levels of HDL cholesterol, central obesity and microalbuminuria metabolic syndrome, produced by genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and certain nutrient excesses. This disease is characterized by the clustering of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and is often associated with dyslipidemia (atherogenic plasma lipid profile), essential hypertension, abdominal (visceral) obesity, glucose intolerance or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and an increased risk of cardiovascular events	[['obesity'], ['hypertension'], ['dyslipdemia']]
5c0e82b2133db5eb7800002d	What forms part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP?	SASP mediates chemoresistance and tumor-initiating-activity of mesothelioma cells Numerous activities of senescent cells depend on the aptitude of these cells to secrete myriads of bioactive molecules, a behavior termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) The SASP supports cell-autonomous functions like the senescence-associated growth arrest, and mediates paracrine interactions between senescent cells and their surrounding microenvironment. Cultures enriched with not-diploid cells acquired a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) characterized by IL1B, CXCL8, CCL2, TNF, CCL27 and other pro-inflammatory factors including a novel SASP component CLEC11A. Senescent cells secrete cytokines and other factors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that contribute to tumor suppression by enforcing arrest and recruiting immune cells that remove these damaged or oncogene-expressing cells from organisms. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether and how adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), a major SASP component, can prevent the SASP Endothelial cell senescence is characterized by acquisition of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), able to promote inflammaging and cancer progression. We have shown that the mitochondria are essential for development of senescence and many of the associated phenotypes, including the often detrimental senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) The diverse arrays of proteins secreted by senescent cells have been described to influence aging and to have both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic influences on the surrounding microenvironment.

Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities, respectively. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1.

5148885ad24251bc05000032	Which genes are involved in patient response to warfarin?	We identified ORM1 as another polymorphic gene affecting warfarin dose requirements. ORM1 *S carriers require lower maintenance doses to achieve and maintain an optimal level of anticoagulation. Detecting genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 could guide clinical use of warfarin to reduce the risk of adverse reactions including bleeding in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy The genes encoding for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) are the major genetic determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant contributions of these genes to warfarin dose requirements. The CYP2C9 gene has also been associated with bleeding risk with warfarin. The CYP4F2 gene influences vitamin K availability and makes minor contributions to warfarin dose requirements There are other genetic polymorphisms that may further explain the response to warfarin. The VKORC1 genotype is an important determinant of response to warfarin in Chinese, but some genetic variants found in other ethnic groups that have a large effect on warfarin response and dosing are not commonly found in Chinese the alleles rs1799853 (*2) and rs1057910 (*3) of the CYP2C9 gene, as well as rs9923231 of the VKORC1 gene were associated with warfarin dose required to achieve anticoagulation with INR of 2-3. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) are known to contribute to variability in sensitivity to coumarins. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms are important factors that influence warfarin dose response in Sudanese patients he response to the anticoagulant drug warfarin is greatly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance for genotyping the VKORC1 -1639G>A SNP and two SNPs (430C>T and 1075A>C) for the CYP2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3), all of which are relevant in warfarin pharmacogenentics. Genetic variability in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes is associated with increased warfarin sensitivity CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms known to affect warfarin response genetic variants of VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and EPHX1 were found to be significant predictor variables for the maintenance dose of warfarin, explaining 26.6% of dose variability. CYP2C9 was the most important gene determining initial anticoagulant control, whereas VKORC1 was more important for stable anticoagulation. Novel associations with some clinical outcomes were found with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytochrome 450 genes CYP2C18 and CYP2C19, which were independent of the associations observed with CYP2C9 and in genes encoding CYP3A5, protein S and clotting factor V, although the variability explained by these genes was small. VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, body weight, age, and serum albumin were found to affect the inter-individual variabilit the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes have been demonstrated to be determinants of warfarin response. On the basis of these observations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a labeling change for warfarin that includes the genetic information of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as factors influencing interindividual variability in warfarin dosing. T the two key genes of interest, the cytochrome P450 2C9 gene, CYP2C9, and the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 gene, VKORC1, on warfarin response The influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes on warfarin dose requirements has been consistently demonstrated in diverse racial and ethnic patient groups in observational studies and randomized clinical trials. genetic factors influencing drug pharmacokinetics (CYP2C9) and pharmacodynamic response (VKORC1). In particular, the discovery of polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene that strongly impact oral anticoagulant dose has heightened expectations that genetic testing Our data suggest that CYP2C9 genotype, age and body size are important determinants of warfarin dose requirements in African-Americans. Our data further suggest that the VKORC1 G6853C polymorphism alone may not be useful for predicting warfarin dose requirements in this racial group. A strong association was found between genetic polymorphisms in six genes, including VKORC1, CYP2C9, PROC, EPHX1, GGCX, and ORM1, and interindividual variability in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the strongest predictors were VKORC1 and CYP2C9. Three of six VKORC1 SNPs were found to be very strongly associated with the average warfarin dose required to achieve the target international normalised ratio (INR; p<0.0001) These results are of considerable clinical interest and confirm recently published results regarding the role of these two genes in modifying warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage. The consistent findings regarding the role of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 in warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage represent a clinically useful proof of principal for the use of pharmacogenomic information in medicine and may lead to improved understanding of warfarin's actions. Clinical studies showed an increased plasma level of S-warfarin, decreased clearance of S-warfarin, increased frequency of bleeding, and prolongation of hospitalization in patients with variant CYP2C9 alleles.

5c7a4a31d774d04240000006	Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?	PD-L1 expression has shown a positive association with response to PD-1 inhibition in noncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g., melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, and is discussed as a potential predictive biomarker for patient selection in these tumor types.  In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development. Emerging data suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1 by IHC have improved clinical outcomes with anti-PD-1-directed therapy, but the presence of robust responses in some patients with low levels of expression of these markers complicates the issue of PD-L1 as an exclusionary predictive biomarker.  The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cells it is not clear whether expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response. Â In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologicÂ features,Â such as the compositionÂ andÂ amountÂ of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status. PD-L1 expression is likely an imperfect predictive biomarker for patient selection and association with other markers of the tumor immune microenvironment will be probably necessary in the future. Taking this data in account, PD-L1 overexpression could not be currently considered a robust biomarker to tailor the immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment. Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. I However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to be confirmed by larger studies. . Although the most studied biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. PD-L1: a novel prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker.  Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of CM aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose. We question the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker in gastroesophageal cancers, as there are fundamental differences in PD-L1 expression between NSCLC and gastroesophageal cancers. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Breaking the biomarker code: PD-L1 expression and checkpoint inhibition in advanced NSCLC. PD-L1 Expression in Carcinosarcomas of the Gynecologic Tract: A Potentially Actionable Biomarker. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker. Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges.

BCL11B is up-regulated by EWS/FLI and contributes to the transformed phenotype in Ewing sarcoma EWS/FLI dysregulates gene expression during tumorigenesis by abnormally activating or repressing genes. The expression levels of thousands of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, however, it is unknown which of these genes contribute to the transformed phenotype. Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant transcription factor to regulate genes that mediate the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma.

In this study, we explore the cause of HSCR by studying the expression of DVL-1 and DVL-3 genes and their proteins in the aganglionic segment and the ganglionic segment of colon in HSCR patients. Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins are key transducers of Wnt signaling encoded by members of a multi-gene family in vertebrates. We report here the divergent, tissue-specific expression patterns for all three Dvl genes in Xenopus embryos, which contrast dramatically with their expression patterns in mice. velopmental processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones from two different human dsh-homologous genes, designated as DVL-1 and DVL-3.  In the Drosophila embryo dishevelled (dsh) function is required by target cells in order to respond to wingless (wg, the homolog of Wnt-1), demonstrating a role for dsh in Wnt signal transduction. We have isolated a mouse homolog of the Drosophila dsh segment polarity gene. The 695-amino-acid protein encoded by the mouse dishevelled gene (Dvl-1) shares 50% identity (65% similarity) with dsh. The Dvl-1 gene on chromosome 1p36 belongs to a family of highly conserved secreted proteins which regulates embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity and specification of cell fate through activation of Wnt signaling pathways. Wnt signaling activates the gene encoding DVL-1; We report here that the mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) and Dishevelled-2 genes encode proteins that are differentially localized in Wnt-overexpressing PC12 cell lines (PC12/Wnt).

AIMS: To prospectively validate the SYNTAX Score II and forecast the outcomes of the randomized Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) Trial. Based on 4-year mortality predictions in EXCEL, clinical characteristics shifted long-term mortality predictions either in favour of PCI (older age, male gender and COPD) or CABG (younger age, lower creatinine clearance, female gender, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction). Given that the completed randomized trials did not include contemporary DESs, the upcoming results of the ongoing trials evaluating the performance of new-generation DES compared with CABG (such as the EXCEL trial), may further help to clarify the current role and future recommendations of PCI for left main coronary artery disease.

58b548d722d3005309000005	Which bacteria cause diphtheria?	Corynebacterium ulcerans is a zoonotic pathogen that can produce diphtheria toxin and causes an illness categorized as diphtheria in the European Union because its clinical appearance is similar to that of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  The zoonotic bacterium Corynebacterium ulcerans may be pathogenic both in humans and animals: toxigenic strains can cause diphtheria or diphtheria-like disease in humans via diphtheria toxin, while strains producing the dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase D may lead to caseous lymphadenitis primarily in wild animals. Diphtheria toxin-positive Corynebacterium ulcerans strains have been isolated mainly from cattle, dogs and cats. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria, has been performed.  Corynebacterium ulcerans 0102 carries the gene encoding diphtheria toxin on a prophage different from the C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 prophage. Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin. Acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of C. ulcerans and C. diphtheriae.  Corynebacterium ulcerans (toxigenic C. ulcerans) produces the diphtheria toxin, which causes pharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria-like disease in people, and this bacterium is commonly detected in dogs and cats that are reared at home.  This case demonstrates that strains of C. ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment. Diphtheria is a serious upper respiratory tract disease caused by the diphtheria toxin (DT) secreted from the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae. ulcerans produce diphtheria toxin, which can cause life-threatening cardiopathies and neuropathies in humans. A high-density growth approach was utilized to produce mutated diphtheria toxin from two strains of Corynebacterium diphtheria: C7 (beta)(tox-201,tox-9) and C7 (beta)(tox-107). For the primary prevention of disease caused by diphtheria toxin-producing corynebacteria, vaccination with diphtheria toxoid is recommended. ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment.

A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway. In cases of human infection with potentially toxigenic corynebacteria, it is important to determine the species and examine the isolate for diphtheria toxin production. AIM: Study of the apoptogenic effect of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxigenic strains on mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation ofapoptosis induced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes strains was performed by characteristic morphological changes in macrophages in smears stained by azure eosin by Romanovsky-Giemsa.RESULTS: Apoptogenic activity of diphtheria infectious agent was established to be determined by diphtheria exotoxin at early (after 1 hour) and surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes at later (3 hours) stages of effect.CONCLUSION: The ability of diphtheria infectious agent to cause macrophage apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of realization of its pathogenic properties determined by the effect of diphtheria exotoxin, as well as its surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes. Extrapharyngeal infections caused by Corynebacterium ulcerans have rarely been reported previously, and diphtheria toxin production has usually not been addressed. Corynebacterium ulcerans may cause diphtheria in humans and caseous lymphadenitis in animals. ulcerans for the first time, we show that related sequence types (STs) might be associated with the presence of the diphtheria toxin gene, which encodes diphtheria toxin (DT), the most important diphtheria-causing virulence factor. Human-to-human-transmitted Corynebacterium diphtheriae was historically the main pathogen causing diphtheria and has therefore been studied extensively in the past. Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the organism causing diphtheria, was thought to have become rare or even have disappeared from previously endemic areas such as South Dakota.

5309f8f5970c65fa6b000001	Which oncogenes are able to induce cellular senescence?	ROS-generating oxidases Nox1 and Nox4 contribute to oncogenic Ras-induced premature senescence Activated oncogenes induce premature cellular senescence, a permanent state of proliferative arrest in primary rodent and human fibroblasts. Recent studies suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in oncogenic Ras-induced premature senescence. these findings suggest that Nox1- and Nox4-generated ROS play an important role in Ras-induced premature senescence A role for c-Abl in cell senescence and spontaneous immortalization Here, we report an important role for c-Abl in replicative senescence and immortalization by regulating the expression of two tumor suppressors that induce cellular senescence, p53 and p16(INK4a). The role for c-Abl in regulating cell senescence and immortalization might explain some of the developmental defects in c-Abl (-/-) mice and how BCR-ABL transforms cells. Ras/Raf-prototypic oncogenes induce cellular senescence, a terminal cell-cycle arrest, as a default cellular safeguard program oncogene-induced senescence, Myc style We review and discuss here evidence for Myc-induced senescence - which is detectable to a limited degree as a cell-autonomous, direct response to Myc action, but occurs predominantly in a non-cell-autonomous fashion via crosstalk of the oncogene-driven cell population with non-neoplastic bystanders, namely cells of the host immune system, prompting them to release pro-senescent cytokines that strike back onto adjacent proliferating tumor cells. genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Activated RAS/BRAF oncogenes induce cellular senescence as a tumor-suppressive barrier in early cancer development, at least in part, via an oncogene-evoked DNA damage response (DDR). Cdk2 suppresses cellular senescence induced by the c-myc oncogene Loss of Cdk2 also caused sensitization to Myc-induced senescence in pancreatic beta-cells or splenic B-cells in vivo Myc also causes senescence in cells lacking the DNA repair protein Wrn. In MEFs, Myc-induced senescence was genetically dependent on the ARF-p53-p21Cip1 and p16INK4a-pRb pathways, p21Cip1 and p16INK4a being selectively induced in Cdk2-/- cells. We have found that expression of such an oncogene, Akt, causes senescence in primary mouse hepatoblasts in vitro. hyperproliferative signaling through AKT might be a driving force of the senescence in activated hepatic stellate cells. oncogenic RAS expression, which causes genotoxic stress and senescence in normal cells, Here we report that the suppression of the c-Myc (MYC) oncogene induces cellular senescence in diverse tumor types including lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cellular senescence is an important mechanism of tumor regression upon c-Myc inactivation MYC inactivation was associated with prototypical markers of senescence only after lymphomas were repaired for p53 expression did MYC inactivation induce robust senescence and sustained tumor regression. Replicative senescence due to telomere shortening can, for example, be induced by a dominant negative version of telomerase, premature senescence by the overexpression of oncogenic ras, or p16. knockdown of HDAC2 induced cellular senescence. MYC overexpression is thought to initiate tumorigenesis by inducing cellular proliferation and growth and to be restrained from causing tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis. Several conditions, including oncogenic Ras over-expression and inappropriate culture conditions, also induce senescence without telomere shortening. We demonstrate that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays important causative roles in senescent cells following telomere shortening, Ras-Raf activation, oxidative stress or inappropriate culture conditions. Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 defines the common senescence-signalling pathway These results indicate that p38 comprises the senescence-executing pathway in response to diverse stimuli. this p38-activating condition appears to be defined quantitatively as a sum of continuous and low-level stresses, and remains even after the initial stimuli are withdrawn, which may explain the well-known irreversible nature of cellular senescence. We also show that papilloma virus E7 abolishes the p38-induced growth arrest but not other senescence-associated phenotypes, indicating the differential role of pRb in the downstream of p38. Expression of caveolin-1 induces premature cellular senescence in primary cultures of murine fibroblasts Here, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent phenotype. Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored. these results clearly indicate a central role for caveolin-1 in promoting cellular senescence Oncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway. In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence. our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms. Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-Î² as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population. The suppression of oncogenic levels of MYC is sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression associated with proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction.

5512c1ee6a8cde6b72000009	Which proteins are the different isoforms of the p38 MAP kinase?	The p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is one of the best characterized kinases in the inflammatory process. Among the four identified p38 isoforms (p38Î±, p38Î², p38Î³, and p38Î´), the Î±-form is the most fully studied and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines i.e. IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± at the translational and transcriptional levels. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the kinase pathways that regulate the production of IL-1Î² and TNFÎ±. Importantly, small molecule inhibitors of the p38 MAPK family have been developed and show efficacy in blocking the production of IL-1Î² and TNFÎ±. The p38 family consists of at least four isoforms (p38Î±, Î², Î³, Î´) encoded by separate genes. Defining the roles of the various p38 family members, specifically p38alpha and p38beta, in these processes has been difficult.  The anomalous p38 inhibitor effect on IL-1alpha induction of MMP-3 and phosphorylation of p38 delta/gamma suggests complex interactions between p38 MAP kinase isoforms and their differential uses by TNFalpha and IL-1alpha in TM. Human and porcine TM cells expressed p38 alpha, beta, delta, and gamma isoforms, which migrate coincident with bands of specific phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is a Ser/Thr kinase, originally isolated from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. There are four isoforms of the enzyme (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta), which differ in tissue distribution, regulation of kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream substrates. We report the molecular cloning of a novel isoform of p38 MAP kinase, p38 beta 2. The p38 MAP kinase kinase MKK6 is identified as a common activator of p38 alpha, p38 beta 2, and p38 gamma MAP kinase isoforms, while MKK3 activates only p38 alpha and p38 gamma MAP kinase isoforms.  four identified p38 isoforms (p38Î±, p38Î², p38Î³, and p38Î´),  The mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family is composed of four members (p38Î±, p38Î², p38Î³, and p38Î´), which are very similar in amino acid sequence but differ in their expression patterns.  Four p38 isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta) exist in mammalian cells, being p38alpha and p38gamma the most abundantly expressed isoforms in adult skeletal muscle.  Among the four identified p38 isoforms (p38Î±, p38Î², p38Î³, and p38Î´), the Î±-form is the most fully studied and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines i The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated in response to various extracellular signals in eukaryotic cells and play a critical role in the cellular responses to these signals. The four mammalian isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma, and p38delta) are coexpressed and coactivated in the same cells. four p38 isoforms  p38 MAPK isoforms are becoming increasingly important for a variety of cellular functions. The physiological functions of p38Î± and -Î² are now well documented in contrast to -Î³ and -Î´ which are comparatively under-studied and ill-defined. Of the four p38 isoforms known to date, two (p38alpha and p38beta) have been identified as targets for cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs.  the contribution of each of the four p38 isoforms (encoded by different genes) to senescence induction is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that p38alpha and p38gamma, but not p38beta, play an essential role in oncogenic ras-induced senescence.  Involvement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms in myogenic differentiation. we showed here that p38alpha, beta, and gamma are expressed with distinct expression patterns during differentiation. The p38 family of kinases is a subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. It is composed of four isoforms and is involved in critical biological processes as well as in inflammatory diseases p38alpha and -beta2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p38gamma and -delta appear to have more restricted expression.
