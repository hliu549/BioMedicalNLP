5a43a933966455904c00000b	How may CTCF mediate splicing?	Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons. Furthermore, we found mutations in the splicing factor SFPQ and in the nonclassic regulators of mRNA processing CTCF and RAD21.  We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin.   Many CTCF sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time. TET-catalyzed oxidation of intragenic 5-methylcytosine regulates CTCF-dependent alternative splicing. Intragenic 5-methylcytosine and CTCF mediate opposing effects on pre-mRNA splicing: CTCF promotes inclusion of weak upstream exons through RNA polymerase II pausing, whereas 5-methylcytosine evicts CTCF, leading to exon exclusion. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives.  A chromatin code for alternative splicing involving a putative association between CTCF and HP1α proteins. Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1α and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1α and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events.   CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. However, there was no correlation between the KTS+/KTS- splicing variants of WT1 and the methylation status of the CpGs of the CTCF binding site. CTCF-promoted RNA polymerase II pausing links DNA methylation to splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide	['Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing.

58b95ea222d3005309000011	What is the function of the Indian hedgehog protein in chondrocytes?	Indian hedgehog (Ihh) regulates endochondral ossification in both a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-dependent and -independent manner by activating transcriptional mediator Gli2.  Wnt/β-catenin, Indian hedgehog (Ihh)/Parathyroid-related peptide (PTHrP) and retinoid signaling pathways regulate cartilage differentiation, growth, and function during development and play a key role in endochondral ossification. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is essential for chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification and acts with parathyroid hormone-related peptide in a negative feedback loop to regulate early chondrocyte differentiation and entry to hypertrophic differentiation. Independent of this function, we and others recently reported independent Ihh functions to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy and matrix mineralization in vivo and in vitro. We recently discovered that Ihh overexpression in chondrocytes stimulated the expression of late chondrocyte differentiation markers and induced matrix mineralization.  In addition, we found that Ihh induced Runx2 expression in chondrocytes without up-regulating other modulators of chondrocyte maturation such as Mef2c, Foxa2, and Foxa3.  Thus, Ihh signaling could be an important player for not only early chondrocyte differentiation but maturation and calcification of chondrocytes. The Ihh signal is essential for regulating proliferation and hypertrophy of cultured chicken chondrocytes. The Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signal plays a vital role in regulating proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes.  Based on these results, the Ihh signal is essential for balancing chicken chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, and the regulatory function of PTHrP acts in an Ihh-dependent manner. Furthermore, BMP-6 and Bcl-2 played roles in maintaining the development of chondrocytes and may be downstream regulatory factors of Ihh signaling. Atf4 is a leucine zipper-containing transcription factor that activates osteocalcin (Ocn) in osteoblasts and indian hedgehog (Ihh) in chondrocytes.  Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is produced by prehypertrophic chondrocytes in developing long bones and regulates chondrocyte proliferation and other events, but it is not known whether it requires HS-PGs for function. We have shown that Indian hedgehog gene (Ihh) is expressed in cartilage anlage and later in mature and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Regulation of rate of cartilage differentiation by Indian hedgehog and PTH-related protein. In normal growth plates, differentiation of proliferative chondrocytes to post-mitotic hypertrophic chondrocytes is regulated in part by a tightly coupled signaling relay involving parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) and Indian hedgehog (IHH). The Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signal plays a vital role in regulating proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes. Indian hedgehog and syndecans-3 coregulate chondrocyte proliferation and function during chick limb skeletogenesis. We further demonstrate that misexpression of Indian hedgehog appears to directly upregulate BMP2 and BMP4 expression, independent of the differentiation state of the flanking chondrocytes. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is produced by prehypertrophic chondrocytes in developing long bones and regulates chondrocyte proliferation and other events, but it is not known whether it requires HS-PGs for function. The cellular expression of two markers of chondrocyte differentiation, Indian hedgehog, expressed in pre-hypertrophic cells and collagen type X, expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, were both significantly inhibited after incubation with isoproterenol Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is produced by prehypertrophic chondrocytes in developing long bones and regulates chondrocyte proliferation and other events, but it is not known whether it requires HS-PGs for function Four distinct chondrocyte populations in the fetal bovine growth plate: highest expression levels of PTH/PTHrP receptor, Indian hedgehog, and MMP-13 in hypertrophic chondrocytes and their suppression by PTH (1-34) and PTHrP (1-40) Although it is known that parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) and Indian hedgehog regulate the differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes, how these pathways interact to regulate chondrocyte development is not fully elucidated Indian hedgehog (Ihh) signaling from prehypertrophic chondrocytes has been implicated in the control of chondrocyte maturation by way of feedback control of a second secreted factor parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) at the articular surfaces Mutant BMP receptors were transfected into cultured embryonic upper sternal chrondrocytes using retroviral vectors to determine if BMP signaling is required for chondrocyte maturation and the expression of a key regulatory molecule, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) Chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth zone are regulated by the Indian hedgehog (IHH)-parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) axis The polymorphic layer in P15 mutants contained fewer Sox9-expressing chondroprogenitor cells because of reduced mitotic activity, and newly differentiated chondrocytes underwent precocious hypertrophic enlargement accompanied by early activation of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) In an effort to lessen the severity of bone defects caused by HhAntag, we treated young mice simultaneously with HhAntag and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which functions downstream of Indian Hedgehog to maintain chondrocytes in a proliferative state.  Chondrocyte differentiation during embryonic bone growth is controlled by interactions between PTHrP and Indian hedgehog. Hedgehog genes encode secreted proteins which mediate patterning and growth during skeletal development. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) has recently been shown to be expressed in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes during embryonic development, and it has been implicated in the regulation of terminal differentiation of chondrocytes. Indian hedgehog and syndecans-3 coregulate chondrocyte proliferation and function during chick limb skeletogenesis. Indian Hedgehog signalling triggers Nkx3.2 protein degradation during chondrocyte maturation. Regulation of articular chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation by indian hedgehog and parathyroid hormone-related protein in mice.

BACKGROUND: Twiddler's, reel, and ratchet syndromes are rare entities responsible for lead displacement of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). The twiddler syndrome results in retraction and coiling of the lead in the pacemaker pocket with subsequent pacemaker malfunction. Twiddler syndrome is described as a spontaneous rotation or intentional external manipulation of implanted cardiac or occasionally deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices.  Twiddler's syndrome is a rare cause of pacemaker electrode displacement.  Twiddler syndrome is uncommon in children and most commonly described as causing lead retraction with implanted cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.  Twiddler syndrome is a form of pacemaker lead dislocation caused by the coiling of the pacemaker leads due to pulse generator rotation on its long axis.

54fc58df6ea36a810c000004	What is the main biological function of the CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing system?	Mutagenesis and homologous recombination in Drosophila cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. We have applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Drosophila S2 cells to generate targeted genetic mutations in more than 85% of alleles. By targeting a constitutive exon of the AGO1 gene, we demonstrate homozygous mutation in up to 82% of cells, thereby allowing the study of genetic knockouts in a Drosophila cell line for the first time. We have shown that homologous gene targeting is possible at 1-4% efficiency using this system, allowing for the construction of defined insertions and deletions. This technology enables controlled genetic manipulation in Drosophila cell lines, and its simplicity offers the opportunity to study cellular phenotypes genome-wide. The prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 type II genome editing system has recently been applied in cell lines and vertebrates. We now demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish is highly efficient, reaching up to 86.0%, and is heritable. The efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system further facilitated the targeted knock-in of a protein tag provided by a donor oligonucleotide with knock-in efficiencies of 3.5-15.6%.  The ease and efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with limited off-target effects make it a powerful genome engineering tool for in vivo studies. Cas9/CRISPR has been reported to efficiently induce targeted gene disruption and homologous recombination in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sequence-specific nucleases like TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have greatly expanded the genome editing possibilities in model organisms such as zebrafish. Both systems have recently been used to create knock-out alleles with great efficiency, and TALENs have also been successfully employed in knock-in of DNA cassettes at defined loci via homologous recombination (HR). Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. The type II CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) has recently emerged as an efficient and simple tool for site-specific engineering of eukaryotic genomes. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to transform genome engineering. We and others have recently shown that the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be employed to engineer the Drosophila genome, and that these modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline.

554a0cadf35db7552600000f	What is the evolutionary process described by the "Muller's ratchet" model?	Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic model for the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a population of finite size. A click of the ratchet occurs when all individuals with the least number of deleterious mutations are lost irreversibly due to a stochastic fluctuation. Population bottlenecks can have major effects in the evolution of RNA viruses, but their possible influence in the evolution of DNA viruses is largely unknown. The accumulation of deleterious mutations of a population directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist, a process often described as Muller's ratchet with the absorbing phenomenon. Genetic diversity is thought to be important in allowing RNA viruses to explore sequence space, facilitating adaptation to changing environments and hosts. Some arboviruses that infect both a mosquito vector and a mammalian host are known to experience population bottlenecks in their vectors, which may constrain their genetic diversity and could potentially lead to extinction events via Muller's ratchet. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is driven by rare fluctuations that lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as Muller's ratchet. The vast majority of mutations are deleterious and are eliminated by purifying selection. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. Primary bacterial endosymbionts of insects (p-endosymbionts) are thought to be undergoing the process of Muller's ratchet where they accrue slightly deleterious mutations due to genetic drift in small populations with negligible recombination rates. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. The theory of Muller' Ratchet predicts that small asexual populations are doomed to accumulate ever-increasing deleterious mutation loads as a consequence of the magnified power of genetic drift and mutation that accompanies small population size. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. We also demonstrate that during repeated genetic bottleneck passages, accumulation of deleterious mutations does occur in a stepwise (ratchet-like) manner as originally proposed by Muller. Muller proposed that an asexual organism will inevitably accumulate deleterious mutations, resulting in an increase of the mutational load and an inexorable, ratchet-like, loss of the least mutated class [Muller, H. In asexual populations, as Muller noted, the loss is irreversible and the load of deleterious mutations increases in a ratchet-like manner with the successive loss of the least-mutated individuals. BACKGROUND: The accumulation of deleterious mutations of a population directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist, a process often described as Mullers ratchet with the absorbing phenomenon. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is driven by rare fluctuations that lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as Mullers ratchet.

This method probes DNA accessibility with hyperactive Tn5 transposase, which inserts sequencing adapters into accessible regions of chromatin. Sequencing reads can then be used to infer regions of increased accessibility, as well as to map regions of transcription-factor binding and nucleosome position. The method is a fast and sensitive alternative to DNase-seq for assaying chromatin accessibility genome-wide, or to MNase-seq for assaying nucleosome positions in accessible regions of the genome. This comprehensive protocol begins with cell harvest, then describes the molecular procedure of chromatin tagmentation, sample preparation for next-generation sequencing, and also includes methods and considerations for the computational analyses used to interpret the results.

ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) technology can interrogate chromatin accessibility from small cell numbers and facilitate studying enhancers in pathologies.

Recently a new technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing named Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) emerged as an efficient method to chart open chromatin genome wide. The application of such technique to different cell types allowed unmasking tissue-specific regulatory elements and characterizing cis-regulatory networks. This technique utilizes a hyperactive Tn5 transposase to cause DNA cleavage and simultaneous insertion of sequencing adapters into open chromatin regions of the input nuclei Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a method used for the identification of open (accessible) regions of chromatin. ATAC-seq is a robust and sensitive alternative to DNase I hypersensitivity analysis coupled with next-generation sequencing (DNase-seq) and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq) for genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and to the sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-sensitive sites (MNase-seq) to determine nucleosome positioning. We present Omni-ATAC, an improved ATAC-seq protocol for chromatin accessibility profiling that works across multiple applications with substantial improvement of signal-to-background ratio and information content. ATAC-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique that identifies open chromatin.	['This method probes DNA accessibility with hyperactive Tn5 transposase, which inserts sequencing adapters into accessible regions of chromatin.

We developed a methodology that models gene expression or chromatin modifications in terms of genome-wide predictions of regulatory sites and completely automated it into a web-based tool called ISMARA (Integrated System for Motif Activity Response Analysis). Given only gene expression or chromatin state data across a set of samples as input, ISMARA identifies the key TFs and miRNAs driving expression/chromatin changes and makes detailed predictions regarding their regulatory roles. These include predicted activities of the regulators across the samples, their genome-wide targets, enriched gene categories among the targets, and direct interactions between the regulators. Applying ISMARA to data sets from well-studied systems, we show that it consistently identifies known key regulators ab initio.

58962dac78275d0c4a000005	What is the mechanism of action of peginesatide?	The erythropoietin-mimetic peptide (EMP) peginesatide belongs to the group of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that are prohibited when misused in sports. Peginesatide is a synthetic pegylated homodimer of two cyclic 21-amino acid chains.  Epo mimetic peptides have also raised expectations. Yet the prototype peginesatide was recalled after just 1 year of its widespread use in the USA because of serious side-effects including cases of death.

5e46fef23f54159529000014	What are the eRNA-producing centers (EPCs)?	Active enhancers in mammals produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are bidirectionally transcribed, unspliced, and unstable. Enhancer regions are also enriched with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts, which are typically spliced and substantially more stable. In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA-producing centers (EPCs). EPCs found very close to transcription start sites of lncRNAs exhibit attributes of both enhancers and promoters, including distinctive DNA motifs and a characteristic chromatin landscape. These EPCs are associated with higher enhancer activity, driven at least in part by the presence of conserved, directional splicing signals that promote lncRNA production, pointing at a causal role of lncRNA processing in enhancer activity. Together, our results suggest that the conserved ability of some enhancers to produce lncRNAs augments their activity in a manner likely mediated through lncRNA maturation.

About 1-2% of introns are non-canonical, with the most abundant subtype of non-canonical introns being characterized by GC and AG dinucleotides at their 5'- and 3'-termini, respectively. Our results indicate that the incorporation of non-canonical splice site models yields dramatic improvements in annotating genes containing GC-AG and AT-AC non-canonical introns If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24% of splice site pairs should be GT-AG, 0.69% GC-AG, 0.05% AT-AC and finally only 0.02% could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites.

58edfaf4eda5a57672000012	What is the function of the dormancy survival regulator (DosR) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis?	The discovery that the tubercle bacillus can develop a drug-tolerant dormant form and the identification of the underlying genetic program 10 years ago paved the way for a deeper understanding of the life of the parasite inside human lesions and for new approaches to antimycobacterial drug discovery. Here, we summarize what we have learnt since the discovery of the master regulator of dormancy, DosR, and the key gaps in our knowledge that remain. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3(+)) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen. During this phase, at least 48 genes, collectively named Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, are important for the long-term survival of bacilli under a non-respiring state, a condition that bacilli encounter inside granulomatous lesions. The non-replicating or dormancy like state of this pathogen which is impervious to anti-tuberculosis drugs is widely recognized as the culprit for this scenario. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence. The DosR regulon enables the pathogen to persist during lengthy hypoxia. Upon oxygen shift-down, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria can induce a genetic program characterized by halted duplication, which is called Non-replicating persistence (NRP). The dormancy survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be essential for hypoxic survival in M. tuberculosis, but it is not known how the regulon promotes survival. The dormancy survival regulon (DosR regulon) is chiefly responsible for encoding dormancy related functions of M. tuberculosis. Our results demonstrate induction of dosR (Rv3133c) and 20 other members of the DosR regulon believed to mediate the transition into dormancy, and that rel(Mtb) is required for Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival during extracellular persistence within host granulomas. Unique roles of DosT and DosS in DosR regulon induction and Mycobacterium tuberculosis dormancy. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the sensor kinases DosT and DosS activate the transcriptional regulator DosR, resulting in the induction of the DosR regulon, which is important for anaerobic survival and perhaps latent infection. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosR regulon assists in metabolic homeostasis and enables rapid recovery from nonrespiring dormancy. The DosR dormancy regulator of Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulates the Na(+)/K (+) and Ca (2+) ATPase activities in plasma membrane vesicles of mycobacteria. DosR/DevR of M. tuberculosis is a two component dormancy survival response regulator which induces the expression of 48 genes. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence. DosR (Dormancy Survival Regulator, Rv3133c) regulon genes are expressed under the conditions of latency/dormancy. Based on these two functions, dormancy survival and regulation, we named the Rv3133c gene dosR for dormancy survival regulator. A binding motif similar to the dormancy survival regulator (DosR) binding site of M. tuberculosis has been identified in the upstream sequences of most genes in these loci. Our results provide conclusive evidence that DosR is a key regulator in the oxygen starvation-induced mycobacterial dormancy response. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3(+)) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen. Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon-encoded proteins may have a role in the maintenance of LTBI. The proteins encoded by the dormancy survival regulon (DosR regulon) are mainly responsible for survival of the bacilli in a latent form. How Mycobacterium tuberculosis goes to sleep: the dormancy survival regulator DosR a decade later. A binding motif similar to the dormancy survival regulator (DosR) binding site of M. The dormancy survival (Dos) regulon, regulated by the response regulator DosR, appears to be essential for hypoxic survival in M.

The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. Activation of AMPK and decreased expression of PGC-1 alpha were involved in this process. the results demonstrated that TMZ is cardioprotective when administered before reperfusion and that this protection appears to be mediated by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling. The study emphasizes the importance of administering TMZ before reflow to prevent reperfusion-mediated cardiac injury and dysfunction. TMZ induced cardioprotection did not involve p38 MAPK and JNKs. Phospho-p38 MAPK and JNKs levels after I/R were not changed with TMZ treatment. Trimetazidine also caused AMPK activation and reduced PGC-1 alpha expression in the hearts of db/db mice.

52fa74252059c6d71c00005b	Why are insulators necessary in gene therapy vectors?	hromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2 motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the "core", which provide enhancer blocking activity and reduce position effects. An attractive solution to the problem of oncogene activation is the inclusion of insulators/enhancer-blockers in the viral vectors. We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects. Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin. The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.	['a) They inhibit oncogene activation upon vector integration and b) They maximize the probability of vector expression upon integration in heterochromatinic regions', 'The presence of insulators in gene therapy vectors is necessary because these elements have the ability to help overcome the problem of position effects, caused due to random integration of the therapeutic genes in the host cell genome.']

Apoptosis is recognized relatively easily due to its unique morphology, but lytic cell death may occur in the form of accidental necrosis, mitochondria permeability transition-driven necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and parthanatos. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death, whose genesis directly depended on caspase-1 activation. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed lytic cell death that could be activated by either the canonical or noncanonical inflammasome pathway.  Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death triggered by certain inflammasomes, leading to the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and activation of inactive cytokines like IL-18 and IL-1β.

550324d7e9bde6963400002f	What is the association between personality trait of neuroticism and risk for Alzheimer's disease?	RESULTS: Individuals with scores in the top quartile of neuroticism (hazard ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.6-6.0) or the lowest quartile of conscientiousness (hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-7.4) had a threefold increased risk of incident AD. Five of nine studies found that higher neuroticism was associated with greater dementia risk (pooled hazard ratio [HR] per unit increase on neuroticism score, HR = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.18, z = 5.11, p <0.001, N = 3,285), and two studies showed it increased risk of MCI.  CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism increased risk for dementia, and conscientiousness reduced risk.  RESULTS: Fully adjusted multivariate analyses showed that the association between the presence of APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]-4 allele(s) and both outcomes was evident among individuals with high levels of neuroticism and extraversion but not among persons with low levels of these traits. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic personality dimensions, primarily neuroticism and extraversion, moderate the relationship between APOE [Latin Small Letter Open E]-4 genotype and cognitive outcomes among older adults.  Individuals with higher baseline scores on vulnerability to stress, anxiety, and depression (neuroticism: odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.5), or lower scores on order and competence (conscientiousness: odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9) were less likely to remain asymptomatic in the presence of AD neuropathology. Neuroticism (r = 0.26), low agreeableness (r = -0.34), and some facets were also significantly associated with advanced stages of neurofibrillary tangles, but the associations between personality traits and risk of clinical dementia were mostly unchanged by controlling for the extent of neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ neuritic plaques. Using mixed models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, social network size, depression, chronic conditions, disability, neuroticism, extraversion, cognitive activity, and physical activity, more social activity was associated with less cognitive decline during average follow-up of 5.2 years (SD = 2.7). RESULTS: After controlling for age, the Alzheimer disease group presented significantly higher scores than normal control subjects on current neuroticism, and significantly lower scores on current extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness, while no significant difference was observed on agreeableness.   In analyses of specific cognitive systems, neuroticism subscales were related to decline in episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed, but not in semantic memory or visuospatial ability. No component of neuroticism was related to the neuropathologic lesions most commonly associated with late-life dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism's association with late-life dementia mainly reflects vulnerability to stress and anxiety and their correlation with decline in the ability to process and retain new information. The finding that AD risk is associated with elevated Neuroticism and lower Conscientiousness can be added to the accumulating literature documenting the pathogenic effects of these two traits.  tau was also correlated with the psychometric measures of episodic/semantic memory, working memory, and processing speed, and with the personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness. The pre-morbid personality domain of Neuroticism constituted an interesting and theoretically plausible, yet uninvestigated, candidate for such an association.  RESULTS: Midlife Neuroticism predicted younger age of dementia onset in females but not in males. Preliminary research suggests that cognitively impaired MS patients exhibit elevation in Neuroticism, and diminution in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, as do patients with Alzheimer's disease.  On the basis of both self-report and informant report, there was an increase in neuroticism and a decrease in conscientiousness in persons with very mild DAT relative to healthy individuals without it, and in persons with mild DAT relative to those with very mild DAT.  CONCLUSIONS: As subjective cognitive complaints in the AACD group were related to neuroticism and gender rather than to cognitive performance, their inclusion in diagnostic concepts such as AACD should be revaluated.  Multiple studies of individuals with Alzheimer disease have substantiated significant levels of informant-rated change in several domains and facets of the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory, including increases in Neuroticism and decreases in Extraversion and Conscientiousness relative to premorbid personality traits.  RESULTS: The AD patients showed higher neuroticism than the controls with PD (p=0.013).  CONCLUSION: Our results support the assumption of specific premorbid characteristics in AD patients, ie increased neuroticism and rigidity. Personality change in DAT was consistent with previous reports of increased neuroticism, decreased extraversion, and decreased conscientiousness, with smaller decreases in openness and agreeableness.  Neuroticism (r = 0.26), low agreeableness (r = -0.34), and some facets were also significantly associated with advanced stages of neurofibrillary tangles, but the associations between personality traits and risk of clinical dementia were mostly unchanged by controlling for the extent of neurofibrillary tangles and A� neuritic plaques.

533eba45c45e133714000014	Why does the prodrug amifostine (ethyol) create hypoxia?	Amifostine (WR-2721, delivered as Ethyol) is a phosphorylated aminothiol compound clinically used in addition to cis-platinum to reduce the toxic side effects of therapeutic treatment on normal cells without reducing their efficacy on tumour cells.  However, amifostine has also been described as a potent hypoxia-mimetic compound and as a strong p53 inducer; both effects are known to potently modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) expression. The angiogenic properties of this drug have not been clearly defined. Both dose fractionation and amifostine protect osteoblasts from the growth inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation. Fractionation but not amifostine was protective for hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor production (used as a surrogate marker of normal osteoblast function) Radioprotective modalities such as dose fractionation and pharmacologic agents such as amifostine have been used to protect bone and other types of normal tissue from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation without significantly impacting tumor kill. To better understand the cellular mechanism of radioprotection of osseous tissue, the authors sought to determine the effect of dose fractionation and amifostine on isolated osteoblasts Tumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy  Immunohistochemical analysis of hypoxia-regulated proteins, namely HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9, was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained prior to radio-chemotherapy. In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation. Amifostine has been shown to specifically protect normal tissues from damage caused by radiation and chemotherapy. An inactive prodrug, amifostine is converted to an active thiol by dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase in the normal endothelium. The hypovascularity and acidity of the tumor environment and the differential expression of alkaline phosphatase in normal and neoplastic tissues contribute to its cytoprotective selectivity. The cytoprotective mechanism of amifostine is complicated, involving free-radical scavenging, DNA protection and repair acceleration, and induction of cellular hypoxia. We investigated additional cytoprotective pathways involving intracellular hypoxia and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, a key transcription factor regulating glycolysis, angiogenesis and apoptosis, which is also linked with radioresistance  tumor hypoxia and ability of cancer cells to undergo rapid repopulation during radiotherapy are associated with failure of radiotherapy. Tumors with low alpha/beta-ratio values or hypoxic tumors unable to undergo re-oxygenation, are unlikely to be eradicated with standard radiotherapy. Although the therapeutic efficacy of accelerated regimens based on low-dose per fraction may be high since they minimize the adverse role of rapid tumor repopulation, the cellular compartment with low alpha/beta-ratio values (i.e. hypoxic cells) remains a limiting factor.  Amifostine (Ethyol) is a prodrug that must be dephosphorylated to the free thiol in which form it can detoxify free oxygen radicals generated by radiation, hypoxia and by drugs such anthracyclines, platinum analogues and alkylating agents. Amifostine as inactive prodrug is primarily metabolized at the tissue site by membrane alkaline phosphatase, which is highly active in the cell membranes of normal endothelial cells and biliary tree cells but not in the cell membranes and neovascular capillaries of tumor	['After the administration of Prodrug amifostine the cells of the tissue prefer anaerobic glycolysis rather than regular cellular aerobic respiration.

55424745ed966d112c000002	Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?	directional mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C) A/T-biased directional mutation pressure Rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v [from an A-T or T-A nucleotide pair (AT-pair) to a G-C or C-G nucleotide pair (GC-pair)] and u [from a GC-pair to an AT-pair], are usually not the same. The net effect, v/(u + v), has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure (mu D), which explains the wide interspecific variation and narrow intragenomic heterogeneity of DNA G + C content in bacteria. The prokaryotic genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure (GC/AT pressure) that has been exerted on the entire genome. directional mutation pressure affecting the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content and at other times, in the direction of AT. GC content of DNA varies, as a result of directional mutation pressure (AT/GC pressure), especially in bacteria. the effect of mutation on a genome is not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. GC-biased mutation pressure Directional mutation theory predicts that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately after the mutator mutation takes place. The parity rules lay the foundation for evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. Directional mutation theory predicts that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately after the mutator mutation takes place.

In summary, both heterozygous and homozygous mutations in several Fanconi anemia-predisposing genes are associated with an increased risk of ESCC in Iran. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and increased risk of cancers including acute myelogenous leukemia and various solid tumors, especially head and neck cancer. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare recessive DNA repair disorder that is clinically characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and increased incidence of malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCCs) and the anogenital regions. In summary, both heterozygous and homozygous mutations in several Fanconi anemia-predisposing genes are associated with an increased risk of ESCC in Iran. FA is one of a group of recessive syndromes characterized by excessive spontaneous chromosomal breakage in which heterozygote carriers appear to display an increased risk of cancer and there is some indirect evidence that FA carriers may also be at increased risk of AML. Mutations in Fanconi anemia genes and the risk of esophageal cancer. The co-occurrence of brain tumors, Fanconi anemia, and breast cancer observed in one of these kindreds constitutes a new syndromic association. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with chromosome instability and a highly elevated risk for developing cancer. BRCA2 is an FA gene and additionally conveys an inherited risk for breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer for individuals carrying a single mutated allele [N. G. Howlett et al., Science (Wash. DC), 297: 606-609, 2002] Around 10-15% of individuals with recessively inherited Fanconi anaemia (FA) develop AML. The co-occurrence of brain tumors, Fanconi anemia, and breast cancer observed in one of these kindreds constitutes a new syndromic association It is postulated that both T and B cells could be involved in the development of leukemia in Fanconi's anemia patients, assuming that chromosome breaks constitute a factor predisposing to the development of malignancy. Patients with Fanconi Anemia (FANC) have a well documented increased risk to develop malignancies, especially Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) The findings within this family support the hypothesis of an increased risk to develop malignancies in heterozygous carriers of FANC-mutations FA is one of a group of recessive syndromes characterized by excessive spontaneous chromosomal breakage in which heterozygote carriers appear to display an increased risk of cancer and there is some indirect evidence that FA carriers may also be at increased risk of AML Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by skeletal defects, anemia, chromosomal instability and increased risk of leukemia	['Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of leukemias and solid tumors.']

Curli is a bacterial α-synuclein (αSyn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system. curli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. In mice overexpressing the human amyloid α-synuclein (αSyn), we reveal that colonization with curli-producing Escherichia coli promotes αSyn pathology in the gut and the brain. Curli expression is required for E. coli to exacerbate αSyn-induced behavioral deficits, including intestinal and motor impairments. Purified curli subunits accelerate αSyn aggregation in biochemical assays, while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities.

This indicated different cyclooxygenase (COX)-downstream synthases and metabolizing enzymes are involved in the AA products' signaling through the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. The presence of many enzymes' and receptors' [(COX-1, COX-2, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES), cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (cPGES), prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS), the PGE(2) subtype receptors (EP(1), EP(2), and EP(4)) and the prostacyclin receptor (IP)] involvement in the prostanoid biosynthesis and activity was confirmed by western blot. The studies implied the negative effects of NSAIDs, such as aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors, which suppress prostanoid production during tissue regeneration for infarcted heart when using hESCs. Thus, pharmacological interference with bradykinin-receptor binding or prostaglandin synthesis following MI is associated with reduced fibrillar collagen formation.

532f043ed6d3ac6a34000023	what is the role of MEF-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation?	The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Gene expression profiling revealed decreased levels of transcription factors transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein, serum response factor, GATA4, and myocyte enhancer factor 2, linked to increased Ca(2+)-dependent calcineurin activity and Notch1 signaling that impaired ESC differentiation. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy. Hypertrophic agonist stimulation of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes increased Mef2 expression by enhancing its translation, without changing its transcription or blocking degradation of the protein. MEF2 abundance was increased by Calcineurin overexpression in vivo and was reduced by Calcineurin inhibition in vitro, without affecting Mef2 mRNA levels. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed association of Gli2 to the Mef2c gene, and of MEF2C to the Gli2 gene in differentiating P19 cells. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins formed a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters containing both Gli- and MEF2-binding elements. We propose a model whereby Gli2 and MEF2C bind each other's regulatory elements, activate each other's expression and form a protein complex that synergistically activates transcription, enhancing cardiac muscle development.  MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors is not only important for controlling gene expression in normal cellular programs, like muscle differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synaptic differentiation, but has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions.  Furthermore, the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptor) stimulated the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 towards MEF2 and PCAF. Supporting the physical interaction and deacetylase activity, HDAC3 repressed MEF2-dependent transcription and inhibited myogenesis.  The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined.  Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). We provide evidence that MEF2 proteins are recruited to target promoters by the cell-specific GATA transcription factors, and that MEF2 potentiates the transcriptional activity of this family of tissue-restricted zinc finger proteins. During differentiation into cardiac muscle, Nkx2-5 expression resulted in the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), but not MEF2A, -B, or -D Similar to Nkx2-5, MEF2C expression initiated cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. These findings indicate the presence of a positive regulatory network between Nkx2-5 and MEF2C and show that both factors can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.

54f0985994afd6150400001a	What is known about efficacy of the high dose intravenous ascorbate in the treatment of cancer patients?	Evidence suggests that IVC may be able to modulate inflammation, which in turn might improve outcomes for cancer patients. IVC may serve as a safe, adjunctive therapy in clinical cancer care. SIGNIFICANCE: Ewan Cameron reported that ascorbate, given orally and intravenously at doses of up to 10 g/day, was effective in the treatment of cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment.  RECENT ADVANCES: High dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).   CRITICAL ISSUES: Neither the selective toxicity of pharmacologic ascorbate against cancer cells nor the mechanism of H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity is fully understood. Despite promising preclinical data, the question of clinical efficacy remains.  BACKGROUND: Treatment for pancreatic cancer with pharmacological ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) decreases tumor progression in preclinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest pharmacologic ascorbate administered concurrently with gemcitabine is well tolerated. Initial data from this small sampling suggest some efficacy.  IVC treatments on all aggressive stage cancer patients showed the poor response of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The high dose intravenous ascorbic acid therapy affects C-reactive protein levels and pro-inflammation cytokines in cancer patients. In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. Recent studies have revealed the scientific basis for the use of intravenous (i.v.) vitamin C or ascorbic acid (ascorbate) in treating cancers, and raised the possibility of using i.v. ascorbate as a prooxidant anticancer therapy. Through the production of H2O2, pharmacologic ascorbate can induce some cancer cell death in vitro and inhibit a number of types of tumor growth in animal models. Taken together with previous studies, high-dose ascorbate has the potential to be a novel treatment option to hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Two popular complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine therapies, high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (AA) and intravenous glutathione (GSH), are often coadministered to cancer patients with unclear efficacy and drug-drug interaction. Ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) is one of the early, unorthodox treatments for cancer. The evidence upon which people base the use of ascorbate in cancer treatment falls into two categories: clinical data on dose concentration relationships, and laboratory data describing potential cell toxicity with high concentrations of ascorbate in vitro. Recently, high dose of ascorbate in cancer treatment has been reexamined. These data suggest that ascorbic acid may have benefits for patients with mesothelioma. Although, a couple of controlled clinical studies conducted at The Mayo Clinic did not support a significant benefit for terminal cancer patients after 10 grams of once-a-day oral vitamin C, other clinical trials have demonstrated that ascorbate may indeed be effective against tumors when administered intravenously. Both these regressions coincided exactly in time with intravenous high-dose ascorbate administration, and it seemed reasonable to conclude that this unconventional therapy must have been responsible for his excellent responses. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. In the 1970s, Pauling and Cameron reported increased survival of patients with advanced cancer treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C (L-ascorbate, ascorbic acid). In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients.

56f82a39cf1c325851000001	What is protein carbamylation?	urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues.  Carbamylation describes a nonenzymatic posttranslational protein modification mediated by cyanate, a dissociation product of urea.  Cyanate, a reactive electrophilic species in equilibrium with urea, posttranslationally modifies proteins through a process called carbamylation, which promotes atherosclerosis.  Protein carbamylation, a posttranslational modification promoted during uremia and catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) at sites of inflammation, is linked to altered protein structure, vascular dysfunction, and poor prognosis.  Carbamylation (carbamoylation) of lysine residues and protein N-termini is a nonenzymatic PTM that has been related to protein ageing. In contrast to other PTM, such as phosphorylation, carbamylation can be artificially introduced during sample preparation with urea, thus affecting studies directed toward in vivo carbamylation.  Carbamylation is a general process involved in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups.  Protein carbamylation is one of the important post-translational modifications, which plays a pivotal role in a number of biological conditions, such as diseases, chronic renal failure and atherosclerosis. Protein carbamylation is a post-translational modification that can occur in the presence of urea. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines, arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines.  Carbamylation of proteins through reactive cyanate has been demonstrated to predict an increased cardiovascular risk.  Protein carbamylation is of great concern both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we report the first structural characterization of a protein carbamylated at the N-terminal proline.  Post-translational modification and functional impairment of proteins through carbamylation is thought to promote vascular dysfunction during end-stage renal disease. Cyanate, a reactive species in equilibrium with urea, carbamylates protein lysine residues to form epsilon-carbamyllysine (homocitrulline), altering protein structure and function.

Using Tn-seq, a genome-wide fitness profiling technique, we identified several functions required for fitness of Y. pestis in vivo that were not previously known to be important. Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the library was produced.

Genome-wide fitness and genetic interactions determined by Tn-seq, a high-throughput massively parallel sequencing method for microorganisms. Tn-seq: high-throughput parallel sequencing for fitness and genetic interaction studies in microorganisms. Here we present the method Tn-seq, with which it has become possible to quantitatively determine fitness for most genes in a microorganism and to screen for quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale and in a high-throughput fashion. Tn-seq can thus direct studies in the annotation of genes and untangle complex phenotypes.  Here we present a method (Tn-seq) for accurately determining quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale in microorganisms. Tn-seq is based on the assembly of a saturated Mariner transposon insertion library. After library selection, changes in frequency of each insertion mutant are determined by sequencing the flanking regions en masse.  Whole-genome fitness analysis in microbes that uses saturating transposon mutagenesis combined with massively parallel sequencing (Tn-seq) is providing a measure of the contribution of each gene to a given growth condition.

A number of bacteria use a class of chemical compounds called acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as quorum sensing (QS) signals to coordinate their behavior at the population level OBJECTIVE Bacterial colonization relies on communication between bacteria via so-called "quorum-sensing molecules", which include the acyl-homoserine lactone group. BACKGROUND N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) is found to be the main component of quorum sensing (QS) in Gram-negative bacteria and plays an important role in biofilm formation. Diverse Gram-negative bacteria communicate with each other by using diffusible N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signaling molecules to coordinate gene expression with cell population density. The genomes of many bacteria that participate in nitrogen cycling through the process of nitrification contain putative genes associated with acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). Many proteobacteria use acyl-homoserine lactones as quorum-sensing signals. Bacterial colonization relies on communication between bacteria via so-called quorum-sensing molecules, which include the acyl-homoserine lactone group.

5eb9a7f60d431b5f7300000c	What is the function of a protein degron?	The N-degron protein degradation strategy for investigating the function of essential genes We developed a dormant N-degron that can be attached to the N-terminus of a protein of interest. Upon expression of a site-specific protease, the dormant N-degron becomes deprotected. The N-degron then targets itself and the attached protein for rapid proteasomal degradation through the N-end rule pathway.   We describe small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh), a technique in which proteins are fused to a degron that removes itself in the absence of drug, resulting in the production of an untagged protein. The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast We fused two degron components into a single molecule to create a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and Rpn4-derived unstructured region. Functioning as a protein degron, the cellular IAP leader dramatically shortened the life span of a long-lived viral IAP (Op-IAP3) when fused to its N terminus. The SfIAP degron contains mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)-like regulatory sites, responsible for MAPK inhibitor-sensitive phosphorylation of SfIAP. Hyperphosphorylation correlated with increased SfIAP turnover independent of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of the SfIAP RING, which also regulated IAP stability.  We conferred such multidimensional controls to diverse Cas9 systems by leveraging small-molecule-regulated protein degron domains. The degron mediated protein degradation represents a rapidly tunable methodology to control protein abundance, which has broad application in therapeutics and cellular function control and monitoring. The N-end rule pathway is a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, in which destabilizing N-terminal residues of short-lived proteins function as an essential determinant of an N-terminal degradation signal (N-degron). Degrons are the elements that are used by E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins for degradation. A 'distributed degron' allows regulated entry into the ER degradation pathway.	['Protein degrons are part of the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional transcription factors.  Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine residues that targets them to the proteolytic machinery. Disruption of one degron by a RNA-binding protein causes it to become ubiquitinated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus.', 'A protein degron is a protein that is attached to the N-terminus of a protein of interest.

514cd15ad24251bc05000067	What is the role of anhedonia in coronary disease patients?	Reduced positive affect and depression/anxiety were associated with poor prognosis, but reduced positive affect was the only independent predictor of events. The incidence of death/MI in adequate versus reduced positive affect patients was 4% (29/663) vs. 11% (23/211); HR = 2.55 (95% CI 1.46-4.34, P = 0.001), adjusting for clinical variables. Reduced positive affect and diabetes were independent prognostic factors, and patients with one (HR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.58-5.10) or both (HR = 5.61, 95% CI 2.25-13.99) of these factors had a higher risk when compared with nondiabetic patients with adequate positive affect, P < or = 0.003. Reduced positive affect independently predicted death/MI following stent implantation, and improved risk stratification above and beyond diabetes. Reduced positive affect (anhedonia) predicts major clinical events following implantation of coronary-artery stents. t follow-up, there were 176 clinical events (36 deaths, 8 MIs, 58 ACS, 55 hospital readmissions, 19 heart failures). Dimensional anhedonia and depression were associated with poor prognosis, but anhedonia was the only predictor of severe cardiac events and clinical events after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Contrary to depression, categorical anhedonia (PAS >23) was an independent and significant predictor of severe cardiac events after adjusting for clinical variables. The incidence of death/MI in hedonics vs anhedonics was 11.1% vs 22.1% (hazard ratio = 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.26). Dimensional and categorical anhedonias predicted independently severe cardiac events and clinical events after ACS. Only depressive symptoms of fatigue-sadness predicted prognosis in univariate (hazard ratio [HR]=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, P=.025) and multivariate analysis (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, P=.025). Symptoms of anhedonia (HR=1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.8, P=.102) and depressive cognitions (HR=1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.2, P=.402) did not. Controlling for sex, age, and medical covariates, anhedonia (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.14; P < .01) was a significant predictor of combined MACE and ACM, but depressed mood was not. Anhedonia continued to significantly predict outcomes (P < .05) when additionally controlling for MDE diagnosis or depressive symptom severity. Anhedonia identifies risk of MACE and ACM beyond that of established medical prognostic indicators, including MDE and depressive symptom severity. The incidence of mortality in anhedonic patients was 22.7% (65/286) vs. 13.2% (121/920) in non-anhedonic patients (HR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.19-2.32], p = 0.003). Cumulative hazard functions were significantly different for anhedonic vs. non-anhedonic patients (log-rank χ(2) = 16.61, p < 0.001). n multivariable analysis, anhedonia remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.03-2.22], p = 0.036), after adjusting for socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and negative and relaxed affect. Anhedonia was independently associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality in patients who survived the first 6 months post-PCI. Depressive symptoms related to lack of enjoyment or pleasure and physical or cognitive slowing, as measured by the HADS-D, predicted all-cause mortality at 8 years ACS patients, whereas other depressive and anxiety symptoms did not.	['Anhedonia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with coronary disease. Namely, in patients with coronary disease, anhedonia was associated with increased mortality, greater risk for major cardiac event, impaired physical health status, more cardiac symptoms, more feelings of disability. These associations were independent from clinical and demographic factors.']

56cd765b5795f9a73e000038	Under which conditions does AMPK phosphorylate TSC2?	The AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status found in all eukaryotes that is activated under conditions of low intracellular ATP following stresses such as nutrient deprivation or hypoxia. AMPK directly phosphorylates at least two proteins to induce rapid suppression of mTORC1 activity, the TSC2 tumour suppressor and the critical mTORC1 binding subunit raptor. AMPK is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy status that is activated under conditions of low intracellular ATP. AMPK responds to energy stress by suppressing cell growth and biosynthetic processes, in part through its inhibition of the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR (mTORC1) pathway. AMPK phosphorylation of the TSC2 tumor suppressor contributes to suppression of mTORC1 TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Conversely, energy depletion reduces Rheb-GTP charging through the ability of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase to phosphorylate TSC2 and stimulate its Rheb-GTPase activating function, as well as by HIFalpha-mediated transcriptional responses that act upstream of the TSC1/2 complex. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Here, we report that LKB1 is required for repression of mTOR under low ATP conditions in cultured cells in an AMPK- and TSC2-dependent manner, and that Lkb1 null MEFs and the hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps from Lkb1 mutant mice show elevated signaling downstream of mTOR. Hypoxia results in energy starvation and activation of the AMPK/TSC2/Rheb/mTOR pathway. AMPK phosphorylation of the TSC2 tumor suppressor contributes to suppression of mTORC1; however, TSC2-deficient cells remain responsive to energy stress. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity.  AMPK phosphorylation of the TSC2 tumor suppressor contributes to suppression of mTORC1; however, TSC2-deficient cells remain responsive to energy stress.  Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to energy deprivation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Once activated under the various metabolic stress conditions, AMPK regulates a multitude of metabolic pathways to balance cellular energy. In addition, AMPK also induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis through several tumor suppressors including LKB1, TSC2, and p53.

Teriparatide results in a rapid increase in bone-formation markers, followed by increases in bone-resorption markers, opening an "anabolic window,"a period of time when PTH is maximally anabolic. Teriparatide reverses the structural damage seen in osteoporosis and restores the structure of trabecular bone. It has a positive effect on cortical bone, and any early increases in cortical porosity appear to be offset by increases in cortical thickness and diameter. Teriparatide (recombinant human 1-34 parathyroid hormone) is used to treat women with menopausal osteoporosis and men at high risk for fractures. . A new class of drugs called anabolic agents, typified by teriparatide usher, has the potential to reconstitute destroyed bone and bring it to its pristine state.  Teriparatide [PTH (1-34)] is a genetically engineered analog of human parathyroid hormone that acts as an anabolic drug by increasing activity in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Teriparatide (recombinant human parathyroid hormone ) is an anabolic agent approved for the treatment of patients at high risk for fracture. Teriparatide promotes bone formation, while bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm the opposite mechanisms of action of teriparatide and alendronate on bone remodeling and confirm the bone formation effect of teriparatide. teriparatide an anabolic drug for the treatment of patients with osteoporosis Teriparatide, a treatment formula of parathyroid hormone (PTH) , is a powerful anabolic agent on bone, improving its mass, geometry and microarchitecture The recombinant amino-terminal fragment of human parathyroid hormone (Teriparatide) is a bone anabolic agent which reduces fracture risk by increasing bone mass and improving bone microarchitecture.

5fdb43d4a43ad3127800002d	What is the function of the chromHMM software?	Here, we publish a frequency profile of the three ChromHMM promoter states, at 200-bp intervals, with particular reference to the existence of sequence patterns of promoter elements, GC-richness, and transcription starting sites.  ChromHMM learns chromatin-state signatures using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly models the combinatorial presence or absence of each mark. ChromHMM uses these signatures to generate a genome-wide annotation for each cell type by calculating the most probable state for each genomic segment ChromHMM provides an automated enrichment analysis of the resulting annotations to facilitate the functional interpretations of each chromatin state. ChromHMM is distinguished by its modeling emphasis on combinations of marks, its tight integration with downstream functional enrichment analyses, its speed, and its ease of use. Chromatin states are learned, annotations are produced, and enrichments are computed within 1 d. ChromHMM helps to annotate the noncoding genome using epigenomic information across one or multiple cell types. It combines multiple genome-wide epigenomic maps, and uses combinatorial and spatial mark patterns to infer a complete annotation for each cell type Our aim was to identify the possible relationship between DNA sequences and the newly built chromatin states based on the integrated ChromHMM datasets of different cells and tissue types. Here, we publish a frequency profile of the three ChromHMM promoter states, at 200-bp intervals, with particular reference to the existence of sequence patterns of promoter elements, GC-richness, and transcription starting sites. Building the Frequency Profile of the Core Promoter Element Patterns in the Three ChromHMM Promoter States at 200bp Intervals: A Statistical Perspective. Based on the ChromHMM algorithm, the genome was divided into 620,122 fragments, which were classified into 24 states according to the combination of epigenetic marks and enriched-feature regions. The nucleotide frequency profiles of nine chromatin annotations with the units of 200 bp were analyzed and integrative Markov chains were built to detect the Markov properties of the DNA sequences in some of the active chromatin states of different ChromHMM regions. We analyzed the publicly available ChromHMM BED files of the ENCODE project and tested the Markov properties of the different chromatin states in the human genome. In addition, we comprehensively compare our method to ChromHMM on three real datasets and show that our method estimates more chromatin states than ChromHMM for those datasets. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm for calculating a set of non-overlapping regions that maximizes the sum of similarities between the vector of focal epigenetic states and the vectors of raw epigenetic states at DNA positions in the set of regions. Nucleotide frequency profiles of regional chromatin segmentations were analyzed, and Markov chains were built to detect Markov properties in the chromatin states of different ChromHMM regions. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a method to estimate the chromatin states indicated by genome-wide chromatin marks identified by NGS technologies. The proposed method automatically estimates the number of chromatin states and characterize each state on the basis of a hidden Markov model (HMM) in combination with a recently proposed model selection technique, factorized information criteria.

515da5b5298dcd4e5100000f	What is the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases? 	All DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases contain a single conserved cysteine. It has been proposed that this cysteine initiates catalysis by attacking the C6 of cytosine and thereby activating the normally inert C5 position. Kinetic and catalytic mechanism of HhaI methyltransferase. Kinetic and catalytic properties of the DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase HhaI are described. With poly(dG-dC) as substrate, the reaction proceeds by an equilibrium (or processive) ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which DNA binds to the enzyme first, followed by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). After methyl transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) dissociates followed by methylated DNA. Our studies reveal that the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases involves attack of the C6 of substrate cytosines by an enzyme nucleophile and formation of a transient covalent adduct. Catalytic mechanism of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases revisited: covalent intermediate formation is not essential for methyl group transfer by the murine Dnmt3a enzyme. We propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the Dnmt3a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer. Co-transfections of reporter plasmids and plasmids encoding the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferase lead to inhibition of reporter gene expression. As Dnmt3a mutants with C-->A and E-->A exchanges in the conserved PCQ and ENV motifs in the catalytic center of the enzyme also cause repression, we checked for their catalytic activity in vitro. In contrast, enzyme variants carrying E-->A, E-->D or E-->Q exchanges of the ENV glutamate are catalytically almost inactive, demonstrating that this residue has a central function in catalysis. Therefore, covalent complex formation is not essential in the reaction mechanism of Dnmt3a. We propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the Dnmt3a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer. Our results point to a possible connection between the catalytic mechanism of C5 Mtases and of enzymes that transfer methyl groups to N(4) of cytosine. Previous X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the catalytic domain of a DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) generating C5-methylcytosine bears a striking structural similarity to that of a Mtase generating N6-methyladenine. Spontaneous and reversible proton transfer between a conserved Glu in the active site and cytosine N3 at the transition state was observed in our simulations, revealing the chemical participation of this Glu residue in the catalytic mechanism. The mechanism of DNA cytosine-5-methylation catalyzed by the bacterial M.HhaI enzyme has been considered as a stepwise nucleophilic addition of Cys-81-S- to cytosine C6 followed by C5 nucleophilic replacement of the methyl of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to produce 5-methyl-6-Cys-81-S-5,6-dihydrocytosine. Hydroxide at 10(-7) mole fraction (pH = 7) is shown to be sufficient for the required catalysis. On the basis of amino acid sequence alignments and structural data of related enzymes, we have performed a mutational analysis of 14 amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA-(cytosine C5)-methyltransferase. We demonstrate that Phe50 (motif I) and Glu74 (motif II) are important for AdoMet binding and catalysis. D96A (motif III) showed reduced AdoMet binding but increased activity under conditions of saturation with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), indicating that the contact of Asp96 to AdoMet is not required for catalysis. R130A displayed a strong reduction in catalytic activity and a complete change in flanking sequence preferences, indicating that Arg130 has an important role in the DNA interaction of Dnmt3a. While Asn167 might contribute to the positioning of residues from motif VI, according to structural data Arg202 has a role in catalysis of cytosine-C5 methyltransferases. The R295A variant was catalytically inactive most likely because of destabilization of the hinge sub-domain of the protein. These two methyltransferases recognize CpG and GCGC sequences, respectively, and transfer a methyl group to the C5 atom of cytosine (C). Most prokaryotic (cytosine-5)-DNA methyltransferases increase the frequency of deamination at the cytosine targeted for methylation in vitro in the absence of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) or the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The target (methylatable) cytosine, if flipped out of the double helical DNA as seen for DNA methyltransferases that generate 5-methylcytosine, would fit into the concave active site next to the AdoMet. These methylation patterns are established and maintained by DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase (MTase), a approximately 1500 amino acid enzyme containing a regulatory N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain. These results lend strong support to a catalytic mechanism in which an enzyme sulfhydryl group undergoes Michael addition to the C5-C6 double bond, thus activating position C-5 of the substrate DNA cytosine residue for electrophilic attack by the methyl donor SAM. 2'-Deoxyoligonucleotides with 5-fluorocytosine residues incorporated at specific positions of the nucleotide sequence are tools of great potential in the study of the catalytic mechanism by which DNA cytosine methyltransferases methylate the 5-position of DNA cytosine residues in specific sequence contexts. The enzyme has Mr 130 000, and introduces methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine into the 5 position of cytosines in DNA.	['The catalytic mechanism of the DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase involves nucleophilic attack of the C6 of the substrate cytosine by the single conserved cysteine of the enzyme, followed by C5 nucleophilic replacement of the methyl group of the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to produce 5-methyl-6-Cys-81-S-5,6-dihydrocytosine. It has been also demonstrated that Phe and Glu, which are found in the catalytic motifs I and II of the enzyme are important for AdoMet binding and catalysis.']

We find that Mbd3 and Brg1 antagonistically regulate a common set of genes by regulating promoter nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, both Mbd3 and Brg1 play key roles in the biology of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the most-influential hub of this network, connecting DNA demethylation to nucleosome remodeling complexes and to key transcription factors of pluripotency.

5172e9448ed59a060a000018	Other than protein coding potential, what features set apart long non-coding RNAs from protein coding genes?	Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts hey are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. he proportion of conserved sequence (4.1%-5.5%) in these macroRNAs is comparable to the density of exons within protein-coding transcripts (5.2%). These macroRNAs, taken together, thus possess the imprint of purifying selection, thereby indicating their functionality.	['Compared to protein coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display a bias towards two-exon transcripts. They are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleous.

5321bc029b2d7acc7e00000c	How effective is the dentritic cells treatment on cancer?	BAFF system plays a key role in the development of autoimmunity, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This often leads to the assumption that BAFF is mostly a B cell factor with a specific role in autoimmunity. Focus on BAFF and autoimmunity, driven by pharmaceutical successes with the recent approval of a novel targeted therapy Belimumab, has relegated other potential roles of BAFF to the background. Far from being SLE-specific, the BAFF system has a much broader relevance in infection, cancer and allergy.   silencing of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (Socs1) or stably expressing transgenic protein Ags in antigen-presenting dentritic cells (DCs) strongly enhances antigen-specific anti-tumour immunity. However, whether the strong and long-lasting T cell responses induced by the modified DCs could modulate the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment has not been clarified. In this study, we explored the anti-tumour immunity of DCs modified by Socs1-shRNA lentiviral transduction combined with sustained expression of TRP2 in different tumour models. We showed that transfer Socs1-silenced or tumour antigen TRP2 persistent expressed DCs, or DCs modified by combination of Socs1-silencing and sustaining TRP2 expression prior to inoculation of tumour cells delayed B16 tumour cell growth, prolonged mouse survival and increased the ratio of CD8+ T/Treg as well as the CTL activity in tumours.  To morphometrically quantify CD1a+ dentritic cells and DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells in HIV-positive patients with anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and to evaluate the effects of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy and HPV infection on epithelial and subepithelial dendritic cells. Our data support an enhancement of the synergistic action caused by HIV-HPV co-infection on the anal epithelium, weakening the DC for its major role in immune surveillance. Notoriously in patients with severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the density of CD1a+ epithelial dendritic cells was influenced by the viral load of HIV-1. Our study describes for the first time the density of subepithelial DC-SIGN+ dendritic cells in patients with anal severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia and points to the possibility that a specific therapy for HIV  transfer of CD40 ligand (CD40L) holds promise as a novel therapy for lymphoid malignancies and a number of solid carcinomas because of its multiple anti-tumor activities. However, membrane-bound CD40L can be cleaved into a soluble form, sCD40L, which contributes to systemic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and induces survival signals in the absence of protein synthesis block, suggesting a deleterious side effect of CD40L gene therapy. We generated a plasmid encoding non-cleavable human CD40L mutant (pcDNA3.1+-CD40L-M) to determine the direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in CD40-positive lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, to verify activation of immature dentritic cells (DCs) by co-cultivation with the transfected A549 cells and to evaluate the lower expression of sCD40L relative to that of wild-type CD40L (CD40L-WT) transfectant in cell-free supernatants. These studies suggest that gene transfer of the membrane-stable CD40L mutant into CD40-positive cells may provide an efficient and safe method to treat non-small cell lung cancer  (AITL) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm clinically characterized by sudden onset of constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, frequent autoimmune phenomena, particularly hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. The lymph node histological picture is also distinctive, constituted by a polymorphic infiltrate, a marked proliferation of high endothelial venules, and a dense meshwork of dentritic cells. The neoplastic CD4+ T-cells represent a minority of the lymph node cell population; its detection is facilitated by the aberrant expression of CD10. Almost all cases arbor an EBV infected B-cell population. Patients with AITL have a poor prognosis with conventional treatment, with a median overall survival of less than 3 years. Patients achieving a good clinical response seem beneficiate from a consolidation with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Constitutional symptoms and autoimmune phenomena, and some times also the neoplastic masses may respond to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide Survivin expression is a poor prognostic marker in a number of cancers. Clinical trials are currently underway evaluating anti-sense oligonucleotides against Survivin, immunotherapy using Survivin primed dentritic cells and peptide mimics that block interaction of Survivin with Hsp90 resulting in loss of Survivin protein stability. Additional approaches using ribozymes against Survivin mRNA, or dominant-negative cDNA to block Survivin function are in pre-clinical stages. Like many genes, Survivin is alternately spliced and a number of new splice variants have recently been identified. Expression of some of these splice variants correlates with loss of steroid receptors as well as the tumor suppressor p53, in some cancers, suggesting that like wild-type Survivin, at least some of these splice variants may also have prognostic relevance. This review will focus on the current understanding of the function of Survivin splice variants and their expression and sub-cellular localization in normal and neoplastic tissues as well as critically evaluating the potential toxicity of the Survivin directed therapies and their predicted effect on the alternatively spliced Survivin isoforms  Immunotherapy applying ex vivo-generated and tumor antigen-loaded dentritic cells has been successfully introduced in clinical vaccination protocols and has proven to be feasible and effective in some patients. A better understanding of how dentritic cells succeed to induce and modulate immunity is necessary to optimally exploit dentritic cells in anticancer vaccines. The authors will review novel insights in antigen loading, activation and migration of dentritic cells and their impact on the application of ex vivo-generated dentritic cell vaccines. In addition, novel means to exploit dentritic cells in cancer vaccines by loading and activation of dentritic cells directly in situ and possible obstacles that should be overcome to induce long-lasting immunity in therapeutic settings will be discussed	["Another approach to cancer therapy takes advantage of the normal role of the dendritic cell as an immune educator. Dendritic cells grab antigens from viruses, bacteria, or other organisms and wave them at T cells to recruit their help in an initial T cell immune response. This works well against foreign cells that enter the body, but cancer cells often evade the self/non-self detection system. By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells. Because a cancer antigen alone is not enough to rally the immune troops, scientists first fuse a cytokine to a tumor antigen with the hope that this will send a strong antigenic signal. Next, they grow a patient's dendritic cells in the incubator and let them take up this fused cytokine-tumor antigen. This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells. When these special mature dendritic cells are given back to the patient, they wave their newly acquired tumor antigens at the patient's immune system, and those T cells that can respond mount an attack on the patient's cancer cells."]

52f1287d2059c6d71c000008	What is the role of the Tsix gene during X chromosome inactivation?	A conservation of Tsix expression pattern in voles, rat and mice suggests a crucial role of the antisense transcription in regulation of Xist and XIC in rodents. the Tsix gene (antisense counterpart of Xist) One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation (XCI) initiated by the Xist gene. One example for antisense regulation is the Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) and Tsix gene pair, which is pivotal in X-inactivation. Xist works as a functional RNA molecule that recruits repressive chromatin factors towards one of the female Xs for inactivation. Antisense Tsix transcription negatively regulates Xist and protects one X-chromosome in cis from inactivation by Xist. Albeit, the precise molecular mechanism is still obscure it has been shown that Tsix transcription regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter. In addition, Xist and Tsix RNA form an RNA duplexes in vivo and are processed to small RNAs, which have a potential regulatory function. In eutherian mammals, random XCI of the soma requires a master regulatory locus known as the 'X-inactivation center' (XIC/Xic), wherein lies the noncoding XIST/Xist silencer RNA and its regulatory antisense Tsix gene. A counting process senses the X chromosome/autosome ratio and ensures that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiates in the early female (XX) embryo and in differentiating female ES cells but not in their male (XY) counterparts. Counting depends on the X inactivation center (Xic), which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing. A 37-kb sequence lying 3' to the Xist gene is known to prevent initiation of XCI in male differentiating ES cells. This region contains the major and minor promoters of the Tsix gene, which runs antisense to Xist Our results identify a function for DXPas34 in murine XCI and demonstrate the critical role of Tsix transcription in preventing XCI in differentiating male ES cells and in normal functioning of the counting pathway. Transcriptional silencing of the human inactive X chromosome is induced by the XIST gene within the human X-inactivation center. The XIST allele must be turned off on one X chromosome to maintain its activity in cells of both sexes. In the mouse placenta, where X inactivation is imprinted (the paternal X chromosome is always inactive), the maternal Xist allele is repressed by a cis-acting antisense transcript, encoded by the Tsix gene.	['One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation (XCI) initiated by the Xist gene.

56eaf4e6107309bc2f000001	How are GRBs (Genomic Regulatory Blocks) defined?	Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes Although gene order in hox and other gene clusters has long been known to be conserved because of shared regulatory sequences or overlapping transcriptional units, the chromosomal areas found through insertional hotspots contain only one or a few developmental regulatory genes as well as phylogenetically unrelated genes. We have termed these regions genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), and show that they underlie the phenomenon of conserved synteny through all sequenced vertebrate genomes. Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene.  We show evidence that GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters. GRB targets are genes with a number of unique features that are the likely cause of their ability to respond to regulatory inputs from very long distances Genomic regulatory blocks are chromosomal regions spanned by long clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements devoted to long-range regulation of developmental genes, often immobilizing other, unrelated genes into long-lasting syntenic arrangements. Specifically, we discuss the recently discovered genomic regulatory blocks which we argue are principal units of vertebrate genome evolution and serve as the foundations onto which evolutionary innovations are built through sequence evolution and insertion of new cis-regulatory elements. We show that these LD blocks contain highly conserved noncoding elements and overlap with the genomic regulatory blocks of the transcription factor genes HHEX, SOX4, and IRX3.  Using a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the fate of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and identify exonic remnants that have survived the disappearance of their host genes after whole-genome duplication (WGD) in teleosts, we discover a set of 38 candidate cis-regulatory coding exons (RCEs) with predicted target genes.  They are therefore functionally related to a number of key protein coding developmental genes, that form genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) with arrays of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) functioning as long-range enhancers that collaboratively regulate the expression of their target genes.  In this paper, we therefore systematically investigate the regulatory landscape around conserved self-transcribed miRNAs (ST miRNAs), with their own known or computationally inferred promoters, by analyzing the hallmarks of GRB target genes Based on these results we used both an elevated HCNE density in the genomic vicinity as well as the presence of a bivalent promoter to identify 29 putative GRB target miRNAs/miRNA clusters, over two-thirds of which are known to play a role during development and differentiation. Furthermore these predictions include miRNAs of the miR-9 family, which are the only experimentally verified GRB target miRNAs. A subset of the conserved miRNA loci we investigated exhibits typical characteristics of GRB target genes, which may partially explain their complex expression profiles during development. Developmental genes are regulated by complex, distantly located cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), often forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) that are conserved among vertebrates and among insects. We have investigated GRBs associated with Iroquois homeobox genes in 39 metazoans.  Integrating sequence conservation, gene expression data, gene function, epigenetic marks, and other genomic features, we provide extensive evidence that many conserved ancient linkages involve (1) the coordinated transcription of neighboring genes, or (2) genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) in which transcriptional enhancers controlling developmental genes are contained within nearby bystander genes. As most of them occur as clusters near potential target genes, the database is organized along two hierarchical levels: individual UCNEs and ultra-conserved genomic regulatory blocks (UGRBs).  Detailed synteny maps between the human and other genomes are provided for all UGRBs.

5a67b152b750ff445500000e	Describe nursemaid's elbow injury.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Nursemaid's elbow usually occurs in young children when longitudinal traction is placed on the arm. Nursemaid's elbow is a radial head subluxation caused by axial traction on the extended arm while the forearm is pronated, allowing for slippage of the radial head. X-ray of the right elbow showed subluxation of the elbow joint with no obvious fracture. BACKGROUND: Pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow) is a common injury in young children. INTRODUCTION: To provide an epidemiological description of radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow, from a database of emergency department visits. In cases of pulled elbow also known as nursemaid's elbow or radial head subluxation, diagnosis is usually performed clinically.  To provide an epidemiological description of radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow, from a database of emergency department visits. Annular ligament displacement (ALD)--also termed radial head subluxation, nursemaid's elbow, or pulled elbow--can be successfully diagnosed and treated over the telephone by properly trained medical professionals instructing nonmedical caretakers. In cases of pulled elbow also known as nursemaid's elbow or radial head subluxation, diagnosis is usually performed clinically. Six instances of subluxation of the radial head ("nursemaid's elbow, pulled elbow") in babies in the first 6 months of life are presented. A nursemaid's elbow most frequently occurs with transient longitudinal traction of the pronated forearm and extended elbow, which can be reduced by manipulation without sedation. Nursemaid's elbow usually occurs in young children when longitudinal traction is placed on the arm. Exceptions can be made in the case of nursemaid's elbow lesion (subluxation of the radial head; pronation douloureuse; Chassaignac lesion) with unambiguous mechanism of the trauma where no X-ray imaging is needed and in heavily dislocated fractures for which one plane can be sufficient. Recurrent nursemaid's elbow (annular ligament displacement) treatment via telephone. Nursemaid's elbow (subluxation of the radial head) is a common pediatric upper extremity injury encountered in the emergency and urgent care settings. Nursemaid's elbow, also known as a pulled elbow or a subluxated radial head, may result from the specific activities described above and is the most common dislocation injury handled by pediatricians. Subluxation of the radial head, or "nursemaid's elbow," is a common injury among children aged 1 to 4 years. Acute annular ligament interposition into the radiocapitellar joint ("nursemaid's elbow") is a common injury in children younger than 5 years. Nursemaid's elbow usually occurs in young children when longitudinal traction is placed on the arm. Several manipulative maneuvers have been described, although, the most effective treatment technique is yet unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the two most commonly performed maneuvers (supination-flexion and hyperpronation) in the treatment of nursemaid's elbow. Radial head subluxation, also known as 'pulled elbow', 'dislocated elbow' or 'nursemaid's elbow', is one of the most common upper extremity injuries in young children and a common reason to visit Emergency Department (ED).	["Nursemaid's elbow is a radial head subluxation caused by axial traction on the extended arm while the forearm is pronated, allowing for slippage of the radial head. Nursemaid's elbow usually occurs in young children when longitudinal traction is placed on the arm."]
58d131218acda34529000005	What is the role of peptide aptamers?	Peptide aptamers: The versatile role of specific protein function inhibitors in plant biotechnology.  These artificial short peptides are able to specifically bind, track, and inhibit a given target molecule with high affinity, even molecules with poor immunogenicity or high toxicity, and represent a remarkable alternative to antibodies in many different applications.  To inhibit the oncogenic action of Stat3 in tumor cells, we have selected short peptides, so-called peptide aptamers, which specifically interact with defined functional domains of this transcription factor.  Aptasensors utilize aptamers as bioreceptors. Aptamers are highly efficient, have a high specificity and are reusable. Within the biosensor the aptamers are immobilized to maximize their access to target molecules. Knowledge of the orientation and location of the aptamer and peptide during binding could be gained through computational modeling.  Understanding orientation and location of the binding region for a peptide-aptamer complex is critical in their biosensor applicability.  Our study clearly demonstrates the ability of MD simulations to obtain molecular insights for peptide-aptamer binding, and to provide details on the orientation and location of binding between the peptide-aptamer that can be instrumental in biosensor development. Peptide aptamers are artificial short peptides that potentially interfere with the biological roles of their target proteins; however, this technology has not yet been applied to plant functional genomics. To extend such strategies we selected peptide aptamers binding to PrP from a combinatorial peptide library presented on the Escherichia coli thioredoxin A (trxA) protein as a scaffold. These peptide aptamers retained their binding properties to PrPc and, depending on peptide sequence and C-terminal modification, interfered with endogenous PrPSc conversion upon expression in prion-infected cells. Binding to the nonfarnesylated peptide was at least 10-fold weaker, showing that the aptamers can recognize the hydrophobic farnesyl moiety. Peptide aptamers: exchange of the thioredoxin-A scaffold by alternative platform proteins and its influence on target protein binding. Typically, peptide aptamers are generated by screening a randomized peptide expression library, displayed from the Escherichia coli thioredoxin A (TrxA) protein. Peptide aptamers define distinct EB1- and EB3-binding motifs and interfere with microtubule dynamics. Reverse analysis with peptide aptamers involves isolating aptamers that interact with a specific protein and monitoring the resulting aptamer-induced phenotype. Peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein reagents that bind to targets with a high specificity and a strong affinity thus providing a molecular tool kit for modulating the function of their targets in vivo.Here we report the isolation of a peptide aptamer named swiggle that interacts with the very short (21 amino acid long) intracellular domain of membrane type 1-metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a key cell surface protease involved in numerous and crucial physiological and pathological cellular events Peptide aptamers are simple structures, often made up of a single-variable peptide loop constrained within a constant scaffold protein Peptide aptamers are small peptide sequences that have been selected to recognise a predetermined target protein domain and are potentially able to interfere with its function Aptamers, including DNA, RNA and peptide aptamers, are a group of promising recognition units that can specifically bind to target molecules and cells Aptamers are a group of molecules, which can specifically bind, track, and inhibit target molecules, comprising DNA aptamers, RNA aptamers, and peptide aptamers Peptide aptamers: The versatile role of specific protein function inhibitors in plant biotechnology Peptide aptamers are small proteins containing a randomized peptide sequence embedded into a stable protein scaffold, such as Thioredoxin Peptide aptamers can subsequently be used to guide the discovery of small molecule drugs specific for these molecular surfaces.Here, we present a high-throughput screening assay that identifies small molecules that displace interactions between proteins and their cognate peptide aptamers These peptide aptamers are target-specific peptides expressed within a protein scaffold engineered from the human protease inhibitor stefin A. The scaffold provides stability to the inserted peptides and increases their binding affinity owing to the resulting three-dimensional constraints Isolation of Peptide aptamers to target protein function. Peptide aptamers with binding specificity for the intracellular domain of the ErbB2 receptor interfere with AKT signaling and sensitize breast cancer cells to Taxol. Peptides and aptamers targeting HSP70: a novel approach for anticancer chemotherapy. Peptide aptamers targeting the hepatitis B virus core protein: a new class of molecules with antiviral activity. These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing. Therapeutic application depends on binding specificities and affinities, as well as on the production and purification characteristics of the peptide aptamers and their delivery into cells. While antibodies are known to recognize the sequence and conformation of protein surface features (epitopes), very little is known about the precise interactions between aptamers and their epitopes. Monomeric recombinant peptide aptamers are required for efficient intracellular uptake and target inhibition. The use of small peptide aptamers to competitively inhibit protein interaction and function is becoming increasingly recognized as a powerful technique. For the first time, we show that trxA-based peptide aptamers can be targeted to the secretory pathway, thereby not losing the affinity for their target protein. Moreover, the aptamers appeared to be able to bind peptides with different solution conformations, implying an induced fit mechanism for binding. Peptide aptamers are small proteins containing a randomized peptide sequence embedded into a stable protein scaffold, such as Thioredoxin. Peptide aptamers are the newest in the class of "genetic" agents that aid in the analysis of cellular processes. Peptide aptamers: The versatile role of specific protein function inhibitors in plant biotechnology. Here we present a detailed protocol for the creation of a peptide aptamer plasmid library, selection of peptide aptamers using the LiRP scaffold in a yeast two-hybrid system, and the screening of those peptide aptamers for a ligand-regulated interaction..

56c4bbfdb04e159d0e000002	What are piggyBAC transposons?	The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis.  The use of nonviral gene delivery approaches in conjunction with the latest generation transposon technology based on Sleeping Beauty (SB) or piggyBac transposons may potentially overcome some of these limitations.  DNA transposons have emerged as flexible and efficient molecular vehicles to mediate stable cargo transfer. However, the ability to carry DNA fragments>10 kb is limited in most DNA transposons. Here, we show that the DNA transposon piggyBac can mobilize 100-kb DNA fragments in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, making it the only known transposon with such a large cargo capacity. The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo. Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint. The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications. In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences Among the transposons active in mammalian cells, the moth-derived transposon piggyBac is most promising with its highly efficient transposition, large cargo capacity, and precise repair of the donor site Transposons are promising systems for somatic gene integration because they can not only integrate exogenous genes efficiently, but also be delivered to a variety of organs using a range of transfection methods. piggyBac (PB) transposon has a high transposability in mammalian cells in vitro, and has been used for genetic and preclinical studies Simple piggyBac transposon-based mammalian cell expression system for inducible protein production. The piggyBac transposon displays local and distant reintegration preferences and can cause mutations at noncanonical integration sites. The piggyBac transposon was developed as an alternative mutagenic vector for mutagenesis of non-P-element targeted genes in Drosophila because the piggyBac transposon can more randomly integrate into the genome. Previous studies suggested that the piggyBac transposon always excises precisely from the insertion site without initiating a deletion or leaving behind an additional footprint. A single injection of piggyBac transposons could achieve long-term inducible gene expression in the livers of mice in vivo, confirming our multiple-transposon strategy used in cultured cells. The plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system enables constitutive or inducible gene expression in vivo for potential therapeutic and biological applications without using viral vectors. In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences. Flow cytometry of cell clones derived from a single multiplexed transfection demonstrated approximately 60% (three transposons) or approximately 30% (four transposons) stable coexpression of all delivered transgenes with selection for a single marker transposon.

5a74d9980384be9551000008	What is LHON, also known as Lebers syndrome?	Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically hetyerogenous group of disorders. They can be caused by mutations of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Some affect a single organ, but many involve multiple organ systems and often present with prominent neurologic and myopathic features. The eye is frequently affected, along with muscles and brain, but multisystem disease is common. Ophthalmic manifestations include cataract, retinopathy, optic atrophy, cortical visual loss, ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis Stroke (MELAS), Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fiber myopathy (MERRF) and Lebers Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) are well known clinical entities that are secondary to mtDNA abnormalities, which has ophthalmic manifestations.

5314ad66dae131f847000004	Why does cranberry juice help combat urinary tract infections?	 Cranberry products affect the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E. coli.   Cranberry juice has been shown to be effective in preventing adhesion of bacteria such as Escherichia coli to the bladder epithelium. Inhibition of adherence to an extent of about 70% with multi-drug resistant E. coli strains was observed on uroepithelial cell. The anti-adherence bioactivity of the proanthocyanidin was detected at concentrations of 10-50 µg/ml with significant bacteriuria.  Still with regard to antibiotic treatment in women, a recently published study investigated also the potential cranberry juice interaction with beta-lactam antibiotics supporting the hypothesis that cranberry juice in usual quantities as prophylaxis for UTI is not likely to alter the pharmacokinetics of these oral antibiotics. In vitro studies have shown that binding of the P fimbriae of Escherichia coli to the uroepithelial tissue can be inhibited in the presence of proanthocyanidins, the active ingredient of cranberries. NDM at concentrations between 0.2/mL and 1mg/mL significantly (P<.05) decreased secretion of extracellular FTF, as well as down-regulated ftf expression in a dose-dependent manner. NDM also markedly reduced the luciferase activity under the ftf promoter. Cranberry juice has long been recognized in folk medicine as a therapeutic agent, mainly in urinary tract infections. Its proposed mechanism of action is antiadhesion of bacteria.  The AFM adhesion force measurements were consistent with the results of a hemagglutination assay, confirming that oral consumption of CJC could act against adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli. These data suggest that daily consumption of concentrated cranberry juice can significantly prevent the recurrence of symptomatic UTIs in children.

58bc9dbb02b8c60953000009	What makes telomerase a good drug target?	Human telomerase is absent in most normal tissues, but is abnormally activated in all major cancer cells. Telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, allowing indefinite replicative capacity. telomerase is believed to be necessary for cancer cells to grow without limit  Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme is considered as a universal therapeutic target of cancer because of its preferential expression in cancer cells and its presence in 90 % of tumors.  Interestingly, almost 100 % of adenocarcinoma, including breast cancer cells, expresses telomerase which makes it a good target for telomerase-related therapy. The observation that the enzyme telomerase is up-regulated in 80-90% of cancer cells isolated from primary human tumors but is absent in neighboring cells of healthy tissue has resulted in significant efforts to validate telomerase as an anticancer drug target and to develop effective approaches toward its inhibition. Telomerase plays an important role in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis and is believed to be a good target for anti-cancer drugs. In contrast to cancer cells, most normal human cells have no or low telomerase levels which makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer drugs. Telomerase activity is repressed in normal human somatic cells, but is activated in most cancers, suggesting that telomerase may be an important target for cancer therapy. Telomerase is expressed in more than 85% of cancer cells, making it a nearly universal cancer marker, while the majority of normal somatic cells are telomerase negative The activity of telomerase is highly associated with carcinogenesis which makes the enzyme an attractive biomarker in cancer diagnosis and treatment The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is expressed in more than 85% of tumor cells but is usually not found in normal cells, which makes hTERT as an ideal tumor-associate antigen (TAA) to develop potential vaccine specifically destroying cancers without impairing normal tissues in human cancer immunotherapy The differential expression of telomerase in cancer cells makes it an attractive therapeutic target The evidence that telomerase is also present in normal B cells at different levels according to their differentiation and activation state makes the study of telomerase activity in B cell tumors particularly interesting Telomerase is up-regulated in the majority of cancer cells and is essential for their survival, making it a potential anti-cancer drug target.  In contrast to cancer cells, most normal human cells have no or low telomerase levels which makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer drugs.  As normal cells have a considerable telomere reserve, even in elderly humans, this makes telomerase an attractive and potentially selective anti-cancer drug target. The expression of telomerase in approximately 85% of cancers and its absence in the majority of normal cells makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Moreover, since telomerase is not or slightly expressed in normal cells, it has been postulated that drugs targeting telomerase would induce low toxicity. Telomerase is expressed in most cancer cells, but not in normal somatic cells, suggesting that telomerase is an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy elomerase, a special reverse transcriptase, has been recognized as a common factor in most tumor cells, and in turn a distinctive characteristic with respect to non-malignant cells Telomerase is detected in the majority of prostate cancers, but not in normal or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue. The catalytic component of telomerase in humans, hTERT, is upregulated in nearly 90% of all cancers, making it the most widely expressed marker of malignancy. With the exception of germ cells and stem cells, hTERT is undetectable in somatic human tissues. he notion that telomerase is reactivated in 80-90% of human cancers has led to the proposal of telomerase as a promising therapeutic target for novel anticancer interventions	['Human telomerase is absent in most normal tissues, but is abnormally activated in all major cancer cells.

601ffa7a1cb411341a000078	What is a ciliopathy?	Ciliopathies are a group of disorders caused by a defect in ciliogenesis, ciliary protein trafficking. Because nearly every cell in the body (including the photoreceptors) contains cilia, defects in ciliary proteins typically affect multiple organ systems. Genetic defects affecting the structure or function of cilia can lead to a broad range of developmental and degenerative diseases known as ciliopathies.  Ciliopathies can arise both as a result of genetic variants in spliceosomal proteins, or as a result of variants affecting splicing of specific cilia genes. Dysregulation of the ciliary dynamics is linked with hereditary disorders, so called "ciliopathy", with clinical manifestations of microcephaly, polycystic kidney, situs inversus, polydactyly, and so on. These systemic disorders include abnormalities in cardiovascular, portal, pancreatic and gastrointestinal systems. ADPKD is considered to be among the ciliopathy diseases due to the association with abnormal primary cilia function BACKGROUND: Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a ciliopathy, a lethal autosomal recessive disorder that occurs in all races and ethnicities; it is characterized by central nervous system abnormalities, resulting in mental retardation, bilateral renal cystic dysplasia and malformations of hands a Loss of cilia and ciliary protein causes various abnormalities (called ciliopathy), including situs inversus, renal cystic diseases, polydactyly and dysgenesis of the nervous system. Renal ver, none of these ciliogenic genes has been linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or function of cilia. To dete a ciliopathy, a spectrum of disorders whose causative genes encode proteins involved in the primary cilium apparatus. In order Mutations in genes encoding cilia proteins cause human ciliopathies, diverse disorders affecting many tissues. The dysfunction of cilia causes diseases known as ciliopathies. Ciliopathy encompasses a diverse group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for components of the primary cilia. 'Ciliopathies' are an emerging class of genetic multisystemic human disorders that are caused by a multitude of largely unrelated genes that affect ciliary structure/function. Ciliopathies are a class of inherited pleiotropic genetic disorders in which alterations in cilia assembly, maintenance, and/or function exhibit penetrance in the multiple organ systems. The "ciliopathies" are a newly defined group of disorders characterized by defects in the structure or function of the cellular primary cilium. Ciliopathies are a group of hereditary disorders that result from structural or functional abnormalities of cilia. Ciliopathies are a group of genetic diseases caused by defects in the function of cilia, that are cellular processes composed of a microtubule-based core. Ciliopathies are human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous organelles involved in transduction of environmental signals such as light sensation in photoreceptors. Ciliopathies are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction and can affect an organ system or tissues. Ciliopathies are life-threatening human diseases caused by defective cilia. The ciliopathies are due to defects of the cellular antenna known as the primary cilium, a microtubule-based extension of cellular membranes found in nearly all cell types. Ciliopathies are a large group of human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary or motile cilia and unified by their overlapping clinical features (brain malformations, retinal dystrophy, cystic kidney disease, liver fibrosis and skeletal abnormalities). Ciliopathies are unified by their overlapping clinical features and underlying mechanisms involving ciliary dysfunction. Ciliopathies are a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of human developmental disorders whose root cause is the absence or dysfunction of primary cilia.

5a7247182dc08e987e000010	Describe mechanism of action of Ozanimod.	The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) agonist ozanimod ameliorates ulcerative colitis, yet its mechanism of action is unknown. Finally, the S1P1 receptor agonist ozanimod showed promise in early trials in ulcerative colitis. ntil recently, three S1P modulators with differing selectivity for S1P receptors were in clinical development for IBD: ozanimod (RPC1063), etrasimod (APD334) and amiselimod (MT-1303). Ozanimod is an oral selective modulator of S1P1Rand S1P5Rreceptors in clinical development for the treatment of chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory diseases. Ozanimod is a novel, selective, oral sphingosine-1-phosphate (1 and 5) receptor modulator in development for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.  Emerging strategies to interfere with cellular adhesion processes involved in lymphocyte recruitment are discussed, including both integrin blockade (natalizumab, vedolizumab, etrolizumab) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibition (fingolimod, ozanimod). RECENT FINDINGS: We discuss the most important findings of one published phase II trial that targeted the β7 integrin (etrolizumab), two phase II trials that targeted the α4β7 integrin ligand: mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1, PF-00547659), a phase II trial targeting the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10) in Crohn's, and a phase II trial that targeted the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1: ozanimod in patients with ulcerative colitis.  As such, agents that more selectively target subtype 1 of the S1PR are of interest and are at various stages of development. These include ponesimod (ACT128800), siponimod (BAF312), ozanimod (RPC1063), ceralifimod (ONO-4641), GSK2018682, and MT-1303.

the cell subsets that express s1p in intestine using s1p egfp mice the regulation of s1p expression in lymphocytes after administration of dextran sulfate sodium dss after colitis induced by transfer of cd4 cd45rb cells and by crossing a mouse with tnf driven ileitis with s1p egfp mice we then assayed the expression of enzymes that regulate intestinal s1p levels and the effect of fty720 on lymphocyte behavior and s1p expression we found that not only t and b cells express s1p but also dendritic dc and endothelial cells furthermore chronic but not acute inflammatory signals increased s1p expression while the enzymes that control tissue s1p levels in mice and humans with inflammatory bowel disease ibd were uniformly dysregulated favoring synthesis over degradation finally we observed that fty720 reduced t cell velocity and induced s1p degradation and retention of naïve but not effector t cells our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation modulates s1p expression and tissue s1p levels and suggests that the anti inflammatory properties of s1pr agonists might not be solely due to their lymphopenic effects but also due to potential effects on dc migration and vascular barrier

602494cf1cb411341a00009c	Describe the mechanism of action of Givosiran.	Givosiran acts as a conventional siRNA to trigger RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing on delta-ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), thus returning ALA and PBG metabolites to the physiological level to attenuate further neurotoxicity.  Givosiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid agent that was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP).  Givosiran (Givlaari™) is an aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1)-directed small interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a ligand to enable specific delivery of the siRNA to hepatocytes. This results in downregulation of ALAS1 mRNA and prevents accumulation of neurotoxic δ-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen levels that are associated with acute porphyria attacks.  Givosiran, an RNA interference therapy, inhibits ALAS1 expression. A number of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Givosiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1 synthesis. After a two-decade journey from its discovery, two approvals of siRNA therapeutics, ONPATTRO® (patisiran) and GIVLAARI™ (givosiran), have been achieved by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Reviewing the long-te Givosiran, another RNAi therapeutic, targeting 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, has been positively tested in acute intermittent porphyria in phase 1/2 and ongoing phase 3 trials.  of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Furthermore, gui In November 2019 givosiran became the second small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based drug to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, it has been developed for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a disorder characterized by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks.

6028204c1cb411341a0000f6	Describe the genetic determinants of common epilepsies	The epilepsies are a clinically heterogeneous group of neurological disorders. Despite strong evidence for heritability, genome-wide association studies have had little success in identification of risk loci associated with epilepsy, probably because of relatively small sample sizes and insufficient power. We aimed to identify risk loci through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for all epilepsy and the two largest clinical subtypes (genetic generalised epilepsy and focal epilepsy).METHODS: We combined genome-wide association data from 12 cohorts of individuals with epilepsy and controls from population-based datasets. Controls were ethnically matched with cases. We phenotyped individuals with epilepsy into categories of genetic generalised epilepsy, focal epilepsy, or unclassified epilepsy. After standardised filtering for quality control and imputation to account for different genotyping platforms across sites, investigators at each site conducted a linear mixed-model association analysis for each dataset. Combining summary statistics, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of all epilepsy, focal epilepsy, and genetic generalised epilepsy. We set the genome-wide significance threshold at p<1·66 × 10(-8).FINDINGS: We included 8696 cases and 26 157 controls in our analysis. Meta-analysis of the all-epilepsy cohort identified loci at 2q24.3 (p=8·71 × 10(-10)), implicating SCN1A, and at 4p15.1 (p=5·44 × 10(-9)), harbouring PCDH7, which encodes a protocadherin molecule not previously implicated in epilepsy. For the cohort of genetic generalised epilepsy, we noted a single signal at 2p16.1 (p=9·99 × 10(-9)), implicating VRK2 or FANCL. No single nucleotide polymorphism achieved genome-wide significance for focal epilepsy.INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis describes a new locus not previously implicated in epilepsy and provides further evidence about the genetic architecture of these disorders, with the ultimate aim of assisting in disease classification and prognosis. The data suggest that specific loci can act pleiotropically raising risk for epilepsy broadly, or can have effects limited to a specific epilepsy subtype. Future genetic analyses might benefit from both lumping (ie, grouping of epilepsy types together) or splitting (ie, analysis of specific clinical subtypes).FUNDING: International League Against Epilepsy and multiple governmental and philanthropic agencies.	['Genetic determinants of common epilepsies are defined as the interaction of mutations in one of two unlinked genes, SCN1 and SCN2, which code for the proteins hamartin and epilepticin, respectively. Disruption of these genes has been found to be associated with epileptic encephalopathies, but it is not entirely clear if this translates directly to the increased risk for epilepsy or via epigenetic changes.', 'The epilepsies are a clinically heterogeneous group of neurological disorders.

We report the identification of a new type of histone mark, lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib), and identify the mark at 63 human and mouse histone Khib sites, including 27 unique lysine sites that are not known to be modified by lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr). This histone mark was initially identified by MS and then validated by chemical and biochemical methods. Histone Khib shows distinct genomic distributions from histone Kac or histone Kcr during male germ cell differentiation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, gene expression analysis and immunodetection, we show that in male germ cells, H4K8hib is associated with active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition, H4K8ac-associated genes are included in and constitute only a subfraction of H4K8hib-labeled genes. The histone Khib mark is conserved and widely distributed, has high stoichiometry and induces a large structural change.

511979b04eab811676000003	How could we infer functional associations from gene fusion events?	Gene fusion is an important evolutionary process. It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. We have developed a Bayesian framework to infer phosphorylation networks from time series measurements of phosphosite concentrations upon ligand stimulation. To increase the prediction accuracy we integrated different types of data, e.g., amino acid sequence data, genomic context data (gene fusion, gene neighborhood, and phylogentic profiles) It is assumed that two proteins, which are found to be transcribed by a single transcript in one (or several) genomes are likely to be functionally linked, for example by acting in a same metabolic pathway or by forming a multiprotein complex. This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteins. PLEX search results are accompanied by quantitative estimates of linkage confidence, enabling users to take advantage of coinheritance, operon and gene fusion-based methods for inferring gene function and reconstructing cellular systems and pathways. While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. detection of gene fusion events can contribute towards the elucidation of functional associations of proteins within entire genomes Inference of gene function based on gene fusion events: the rosetta-stone method. protein domain fusions in human protein interaction networks prediction Some proteins, involved in a common biological process and encoded by separate genes in one organism, can be found fused within a single protein chain in other organisms. By detecting these triplets, a functional relationship can be established between the unfused proteins. These results suggest that domain fusion is an appropriate method for predicting protein complexes. The detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for the prediction of functional associations of proteins, including physical interactions or complex formation. These genomic constraints form the basis for a variety of techniques that employ systematic genome comparisons to predict functional associations among genes. The most powerful techniques to date are based on conserved gene neighborhood, gene fusion events, and common phylogenetic distributions of gene families Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. Genes linked by fusion events are generally of the same functional category a functional association between two genes can be derived from the existence of a fusion of the two as one continuous sequence in another genome Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events Because there must be selective pressure for certain genes to be fused over the course of evolution, we are able to predict functional associations of proteins. We observed that gene fusion events are more related to physical interaction between proteins than to other weaker functional relationships such as participation in a common biological pathway. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments. Domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the functional association of the component proteins. Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison.	["The detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for the prediction of functional associations of proteins, based on the observation that related proteins in one organism (including physically interacting proteins/members of complexes, proteins involved in the same pathway) tend to be found in other species as a fused composite gene encoding a single multifunctional protein. For this purpose, gene fusion events may be used as the sole evidence or as independent information combined with other 'genome-aware' or similarity-based methods, and functional association may be predicted at different levels. An advantage of this approach is that it is not necessary to know the function of the composite/components to infer association."]

The 4-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 4CMenB (Bexsero) is the first vaccine against this serogroup and has been approved by licensing authorities in Europe, Canada and Australia.  Implementation of meningococcal B vaccination (Bexsero®) in France: Physicians' perceptions and experiences of a few months after marketing approval In December 2013, the French public health authorities recommended the use of Bexsero® (meningococcus B vaccine) in areas with endemic risk and for patients at risk for invasive meningococcal B disease.  Bexsero, a novel vaccine against meningococcus Meningococcus B is the most prevalent Neisseria meningitidis serogroup isolated in Hungary. Bexsero is one of the vaccines developed against it, which has been available in Hungary since the summer of 2014.  Vaccinating Italian infants with a new multicomponent vaccine (Bexsero®) against meningococcal B disease: A cost-effectiveness analysis. The European Medicines Agency has approved a multicomponent serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (Bexsero®) for use in individuals of 2 months of age and older. Our results suggest that vaccinating infants in Italy with Bexsero® has the ability to significantly reduce meningococcal disease and, if the probable underestimation of disease incidence is considered, routine vaccination is advisable. Since the antigens selected for Bexsero® are also harbored by meningococci belonging to other serogroups there may be the potential for Bexsero® to offer a certain level of protection against non-B serogroups. [Bexsero, a novel vaccine against meningococcus]. The new available vaccines are Bexsero® and Trumenba®. Surface-expressed protein antigens such as factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) and Porin protein A (PorA); all express sequence variability that can affect their function as protective immunogens when used in meningococcal serogroup B vaccines like the recently-approved 4CMenB (Bexsero(®)). Proteinaceous meningococcal B vaccines are under development, and the most advanced, Bexsero, is currently being evaluated by the European Medicines Agency. Among them, the Reverse Vaccinology approach was successfully applied to the development of an innovative vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, now available on the market with the commercial name BEXSERO® (Novartis Vaccines). Recently, a vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero(®)), containing three recombinant proteins, and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) derived from a serogroup B meningococcal strain (MenB) has been licensed in Europe and Australia and is indicated for persons aged 2 mo or older. Multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB; Bexsero(®)) is a unique vaccine containing four main immunogenic components: three recombinant proteins combined with outer membrane vesicles derived from meningococcal NZ98/254 strain Recently, a universal serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, Bexsero(®), was licensed in Europe, Australia and United States, following several clinical studies demonstrating its immunogenicity and safety Like any drug, Bexsero(®) and Trumemba(®) will require close observation to assess their impact on meningococcal epidemiology. <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS Bexsero, a new vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB), is composed of 3 main recombinant proteins and an outer membrane vesicle component The meningococcal 4CMenB vaccine (Bexsero; Novartis) contains four antigens that can elicit serum bactericidal activity, one of which is factor H (FH)-binding protein (FHbp) In December 2013 Bexsero® became available in Germany for vaccination against serogroup B meningococci (MenB) Bexsero® is based on surface protein antigens expressed by about 80% of circulating serogroup B meningococci in Germany Re-evaluating cost effectiveness of universal meningitis vaccination (Bexsero) in England: modelling study.

BACKGROUND: 4CMenB (Bexsero), a vaccine developed against invasive meningococcal disease caused by capsular group B strains (MenB), was recently licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency.  Bexsero is the first meningococcal B vaccine to be approved in the European Union.  Quantification by LC-MS(E) of outer membrane vesicle proteins of the Bexsero® vaccine. We previously demonstrated the immunogenicity and tolerability of the serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero), in 11-17 y-olds randomized to receive 1, 2, or 3 doses at 1, 2, or 6 mo intervals.  This policy statement provides recommendations for the prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease through the use of 2 newly licensed serogroup B meningococcal vaccines: MenB-FHbp (Trumenba; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Philadelphia, PA) and MenB-4C (Bexsero; Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy). An outbreak of Neisseria meningitidis serotype B infection occurred at a small residential university; public health announced an organizational vaccination program with the 4-component Meningococcal B (4CMenB) vaccine (Bexsero(TM), Novartis/GlaxoSmithKline Inc.) several days later. Bexsero, a new vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease (MenB), was licensed in Europe in January 2013. Recently approved in the EU, US, Australia, and Canada, 4CMenB (Bexsero(®), GSK Vaccines) is a multi-component meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine containing 3 surface exposed recombinant proteins (fHbp, NadA, and NHBA) and New Zealand strain outer membrane vesicles (NZ OMV) containing PorA 1.4. In Germany, Bexsero is recommended for persons at increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease, but not for universal childhood vaccination. To support decision making we adapted the independently developed model for England to the German setting to predict the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination with Bexsero(®) against MenB disease. This has resulted in a multicomponent, recombinant, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine: 4CMenB (Bexsero(®), Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, NC, USA), containing four main immunogenic components: two recombinant fusion proteins (Neisseria heparin-binding antigen-GNA1030 and factor H-binding protein-GNA2091); recombinant Neisserial adhesion A; and detergent-treated outer membrane vesicles derived from the meningococcal NZ98/254 strain, where porin A 1.4 is the major immunodominant antigen.

Later, AD was also associated with mutated early-onset (presenilin 1/2, PSEN1/2 and APP) and late-onset (apolipoprotein E, ApoE) genes. Genome-wide association and linkage analysis studies with identified multiple genomic areas have implications for the treatment of AD.  we apply the proposed methodology to the data of several biomarkers collected by the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, an international family-clustered registry to study autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease which is a rare form of Alzheimer disease caused by mutations in any of the three genes including the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2.

Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding, affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels. These data provide a functional explanation for the genetic association of HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphisms with human erythroid traits and HbF levels. Our results further designate MYB as a target for therapeutic induction of HbF to ameliorate sickle cell and β-thalassemia disease severity.

5e49bcce6d0a27794100000f	What is the role of Scc2/Nipbl?	Scc2 (Nipbl) stimulates cohesin's ABC-like ATPase and is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin's ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking in human cells, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2's movement within chromatin is consistent with a 'stop-and-go' or 'hopping' motion. We suggest that a low diffusion coefficient, a low stoichiometry relative to cohesin, and a high affinity for chromosomal cohesin enables Scc2 to move rapidly from one chromosomal cohesin complex to another, performing a function distinct from loading. Scc2 (Nipbl) stimulates cohesin's ABC-like ATPase and is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes.

5e2d80cafbd6abf43b00000d	What is the 4D-CHAINS algorithm?	Automated methods for NMR structure determination of proteins are continuously becoming more robust. However, current methods addressing larger, more complex targets rely on analyzing 6-10 complementary spectra, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. Here, we describe 4D-CHAINS/autoNOE-Rosetta, a complete pipeline for NOE-driven structure determination of medium- to larger-sized proteins. The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta.

55253d7087ecba3764000008	Which phenomenon is described as oncogene addiction?	Tumor cell growth and survival can often be impaired by inactivating a single oncogen- a phenomenon that has been called as "oncogene addiction." It is in such scenarios that molecular targeted therapies may succeed. The clinical efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors supports the dependence of distinct subsets of cancers on specific driver mutations for survival, a phenomenon called "oncogene addiction. A given tumor is usually dependent on the oncogene that is activated in the respective tumor entity. This phenomenon called oncogene addiction provides the rationale for attempts to target oncogene products in a therapeutic manner, be it by small molecules, by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) or by antigen-specific T cells. It has long been established that cancers can become addicted to particular oncogenes. Despite the genetic complexity that governs tumorigenesis, certain cancers can exhibit a critical dependency on the expression of a single oncogene, which when removed leads to death of the cancer cell.  We now know that oncogenes are dysfunctional proto-oncogenes and that dysfunctional tumor suppressor genes contribute to the cancer process. Furthermore, Weinstein and others have hypothesized the phenomenon of oncogene addiction as a distinct characteristic of the malignant cell. It can be assumed that cancer cells, indeed, become dependent on such vital oncogenes. The products of these vital oncogenes, such as c-myc, may well be the Achilles heel by which targeted molecular therapy may lead to truly personalized cancer therapy. Despite complex genomic and epigenetic abnormalities, many cancers are irrevocably dependent on an initiating oncogenic lesion whose restoration to a normal physiological activation can elicit a dramatic and sudden reversal of their neoplastic properties. This phenomenon of the reversal of tumorigenesis has been described as oncogene addiction. Oncogene addiction had been thought to occur largely through tumour cell-autonomous mechanisms such as proliferative arrest, apoptosis, differentiation and cellular senescence.  Cancers can exhibit marked tumor regression after oncogene inhibition through a phenomenon called "oncogene addiction." The ability to predict when a tumor will exhibit oncogene addiction would be useful in the development of targeted therapeutics. Oncogene addiction is likely the consequence of many cellular programs. However, we reasoned that many of these inputs may converge on aggregate survival and death signals. The suppression of oncogenic levels of MYC is sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression associated with proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. Although human cancers have complex genotypes and are genomically unstable, they often remain dependent on the continued presence of single-driver mutations-a phenomenon dubbed "oncogene addiction." Such dependencies have been demonstrated in mouse models, where conditional expression systems have revealed that oncogenes able to initiate cancer are often required for tumor maintenance and progression, thus validating the pathways they control as therapeutic targets. Oncogene addiction is a phenomenon that the survival of cancer cells depends on an activated oncogene or inactivation of tumor suppressor gene, and is regarded as the 'Achilles heel' of the successful molecular targeted therapies in cancer. Inhibition of an initiating oncogene often leads to extensive tumour cell death, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. This has led to the search for compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. Cancer is a multistep process whereby genetic events that result in the activation of proto-oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes usurp physiologic programs mandating relentless proliferation and growth. Experimental evidence surprisingly illustrates that the inactivation of even a single oncogene can be sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression. These observations suggest the hypothesis that tumors become irrevocably addicted to the oncogenes that initiated tumorigenesis. The proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that activated oncogenes result in a signaling state in which the sudden abatement of oncogene activity balances towards proliferative arrest and apoptosis. Indeed, substantial evidence supports this hypothesis. Cancer cells contain multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Despite this complexity, their growth and survival can often be impaired by the inactivation of a single oncogene. This phenomenon, called "oncogene addiction," provides a rationale for molecular targeted therapy. Does an activated oncogene that initiates tumor growth need to remain activated to maintain the cancer phenotype? This question has been answered affirmatively by experiments in which doxycycline-regulated oncogene activation induces growth of large tumors that regress completely upon oncogene inactivation--a phenomenon called oncogene addiction. We assemble here the evidence that oncogene addiction is angiogenesis-dependent. "Oncogene addiction" describes the curious acquired dependence of tumor cells on an activated oncogene for their survival and/or proliferation, a phenomenon that has important implications for the success of targeted cancer therapies. However, the mechanisms explaining oncogene addiction remain elusive. We propose that "addiction" may be an illusion generated as a consequence of differential attenuation rates of prosurvival and proapoptotic signals emanating from an oncoprotein acutely following its inactivation. According to this model, which we call "oncogenic shock," prosurvival signals dissipate quickly on oncoprotein inactivation whereas proapoptotic signals linger sufficiently long to commit the cell to an apoptotic death.

This element, which we have named pet (positive effector of transcription), exerts its effect in cis in a position and orientation-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as part of the nascent pregenome transcript.  In the presence of this region, deletion of pet activates transcription from downstream promoters, suggesting that pregenome transcription complexes fail to reach the downstream promoters. In vitro transcription experiments support the model that pet is required for transcription elongation on the DHBV template. We speculate that pet is required to suppress transcription termination during the first passage of pregenome transcription complexes through a viral termination region on the circular viral DNA.

601d2ec01cb411341a00002d	What is caused by de novo sox6 variants?	De Novo SOX6 Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Associated with ADHD, Craniosynostosis, and Osteochondromas. For SOX6, these processes include, but are not limited to, neurogenesis and skeletogenesis. Variants in half of the SOX genes have been shown to cause severe developmental and adult syndromes, referred to as SOXopathies. We here provide evidence that SOX6 variants also cause a SOXopathy. Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families. Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas. All variants are heterozygous. Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant. Intragenic microdeletions, balanced structural rearrangements, frameshifts, and nonsense variants are predicted to inactivate the SOX6 variant allele. Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily. These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging. Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in vitro. No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found. Taken together, these findings concur that SOX6 haploinsufficiency leads to a neurodevelopmental SOXopathy that often includes ADHD and abnormal skeletal and other features.	['SOX6 belongs to a family of 20 SRY-related HMG-box-containing (SOX) genes that encode transcription factors controlling cell fate and differentiation in many developmental and adult processes.

58dcd0338acda34529000022	What is the role of the MCM2-7 complex?	The role of the MCM2-7 helicase complex during Arabidopsis seed development. The MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex, a ring-shaped heterohexamer, unwinds the DNA double helix ahead of the other replication machinery.  MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. After forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) with other components, the MCM2-7 complex is activated by DDK/cyclin-dependent kinase to initiate DNA replication.  Hexameric complexes of the six related Mcm2-7 proteins form the core of the replicative helicase.  MCM-BP regulates unloading of the MCM2-7 helicase in late S phase. Origins of DNA replication are licensed by recruiting MCM2-7 to assemble the prereplicative complex (pre-RC).  Mec1 is one of multiple kinases that prime the Mcm2-7 helicase for phosphorylation by Cdc7. Activation of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex, requires phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase or DDK), which, in turn, depends on prior phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by an unknown kinase (or kinases) The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing.  A double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication. During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. During S phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC MCM2-7 is inactive.  The quaternary structure of MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC formation. Using electron microscopy (EM), we observed that loaded MCM2-7 encircles DNA. The loaded MCM2-7 complex can slide on DNA, and sliding is not directional. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks. Cdt1 is required for loading the replicative DNA helicase MCM2/7, a process known as DNA replication licensing. Both the Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2~7 complexes stimulate RNA primer synthesis by DNA primase in vitro. MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells These biochemical data suggest that phosphorylation of MCM4 at these sites by CDK plays a direct role in dislodging MCM2-7 from chromatin and/or preventing re-loading of the complex to chromatin The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing In this report, we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in HeLa cells to examine the interactions between Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS complex (collectively called the CMG complex), which seem to play a key role in the formation and progression of replication forks The origin recognition complex (ORC) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds origin DNA and cooperates with Cdc6 and Cdt1 to load the replicative helicase MCM2-7 onto DNA The CMG (Cdc45·Mcm2-7·GINS) complex, which is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and the GINS (Go-Ichi-Ni-San) complex consisting of Sld5 and Psf1 to Psf3, is recruited by Cdc6 and Cdt1 onto origins bound by the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) and functions as a replicative helicase MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2-7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. The MCM2-7 complex, which may act as a replicative helicase during DNA synthesis, plays a central role in S-phase genome stability. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an essential role in origin licensing. In this work, we demonstrate that subunits of the MCM2-7 complex are coordinately expressed during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) development and are abundant in proliferating and endocycling tissues, indicative of a role in DNA replication. Cdc6 and Cdt1 play an essential role in DNA replication initiation by loading the Mcm2-7 complex, which is required for unwinding the DNA helix, onto chromosomal origins. Inspired by the role of the rigid region in promoters, we speculate that the rigid replication origins may facilitate binding of proteins, including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and the MCM2-7 complex. Overall, our data identify a new Mcm protein, which does not form part of the Mcm2-7 complex and which is only structure-bound during S phase, thus suggesting its specific role in DNA replication. Using Mcm4/6/7 as a tool, we reveal a role for nucleotide binding by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm2 in modulating DNA binding by Mcm complexes. The ORC/Cdc6/MCM2-7 complex facilitates MCM2-7 dimerization during prereplicative complex formation. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7 complex and an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 complex are reported, which together provide new insights into DNA licensing. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks..

58946d6e7d9090f353000005	What is MPE-seq?	MPE-seq, a new method for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure. The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias.

55048939f8aee20f27000009	Explain the concept proteostasis.	Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, refers to a proper balance between synthesis, maturation, and degradation of cellular proteins. Mechanisms that promote the homeostasis of the proteome, or proteostasis, can slow aging and decrease the incidence of age-related diseases. The eukaryotic cell possesses specialized pathways to turn over and degrade redundant proteins and organelles. Each pathway is unique and responsible for degradation of distinctive cytosolic material. The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy (chaperone-mediated, macro, micro and organelle specific) act synergistically to maintain proteostasis. Defects in this equilibrium can be deleterious at cellular and organism level, giving rise to various disease states.  protein homeostasis (proteostasis)  The folding biology common to all three kingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) is proteostasis. The proteostasis network (PN) functions as a “cloud” to generate, protect, and degrade the proteome. Maintaining the dynamic proteome of a living cell in the face of an ever-changing environment depends on a fine-tuned balance of protein synthesis and protein degradation. Molecular chaperones exert key functions during protein homeostasis (proteostasis).  This research highlighted the central importance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis for short, defined as the cellular state in which the proteome is both stable and functional. It implicates an equilibrium between synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, disaggregation and degradation. Protein homeostasis, also called proteostasis, is critical for cellular health and its dysregulation is implicated in aging, cancer, metabolic disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.  protein homeostasis (proteostasis)   Disruption of proteostasis is implicated in aging and the pathogenesis of numerous degenerative diseases. Protein homeostasis, proteostasis, is essential to understand cell function. Protein degradation is a crucial component of the proteostatic mechanisms of the cell. Maintaining correct cellular function is a fundamental biological process for all forms of life. A critical aspect of this process is the maintenance of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in the cell, which is largely performed by a group of proteins, referred to as the protein quality control (PQC) network. This network of proteins, comprised of chaperones and proteases, is critical for maintaining proteostasis not only during favourable growth conditions, but also in response to stress.  All organisms--Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya--have evolved a protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, network comprising chaperones and folding factors, degradation components, signalling pathways and specialized compartmentalized modules that manage protein folding in response to environmental stimuli and variation.

533c394ec45e13371400000c	Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?	The H(2)O(2)-dependent sGCβ1 upregulation was attributable to sGCβ1 mRNA stabilization, conditioned by the translocation of the mRNA-binding protein HuR from the nucleus to the cytosol, and the increased mRNA binding of HuR to the sGCβ1 3' untranslated region. HuR silencing reversed the effects of H(2)O(2) on sGCβ1 levels and cGMP synthesis. Our results identify H(2)O(2) as an endogenous mediator contributing to the regulation of vascular tone and point to a key role of HuR in sGCβ1 mRNA stabilization. Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a "young cell" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. The in vitro binding selectivity of HuR is indicative of an ARE sequence's ability to destabilize a mRNA in vivo, suggesting a critical role for HuR in the regulation of mRNA degradation. urification and subsequent analyses demonstrate that this 32 kDa protein is identical to a recently identified member of the Elav-like gene family (ELG) called HuR. We also show that HuR can be induced to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this redistribution is associated with an altered function. RNA stabilization by the AU-rich element binding protein, HuR, an ELAV protein. ELAV protein HuA (HuR) can redistribute between nucleus and cytoplasm and is upregulated during serum stimulation and T cell activation.  HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (18, 19). We propose that HuR first may bind AU-rich element-containing mRNAs in the nucleus and then escort them through the nuclear pore, providing protection during and after export to the cytoplasmic compartment. Taken together, these data show that a correlation exists between the binding of HuR to the AU-rich motif in vitro and the destabilizing properties conferred by this sequence in vivo. HuR interacts with AU-rich elements in the 3'UTR of many protooncogenes, cytokines, and transcription factors, thereby regulating the expression of these mRNAs on the posttranscriptional level. Transfection assays with a CAT reporter construct revealed reduced expression of the reporter, suggesting that HuR may be involved in the fine-tuning of the expression of the NF1 gene. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a "younger" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. Our studies highlight a critical role for HuR during the process of replicative senescence. Here, using two models of replicative senescence, we describe the influence of the RNA-binding protein HuR in regulating the expression of several genes whose expression decreases during senescence We demonstrate that HuR levels, HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding proliferative genes, and the half-lives of such mRNAs are lower in senescent cells. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Although in vitro experiments showed indiscriminate binding of Hu proteins synthesized in bacterial systems to many different AU-rich elements (AREs), in vivo studies have pointed to a cytoplasmic role for HuR protein in antagonizing the rapid decay of some specific ARE-containing mRNAs, depending on physiological situations. Our data suggest that the ARE-binding specificity of HuR in vivo is modulated to interact only with and thus regulate specific AREs in a cell type- and physiological state-dependent manner. Overexpression of HuD and HuR in murine fibroblasts caused a striking stabilization of the endogenous MARCKS mRNA even under conditions when the MARCKS mRNA is normally actively degraded, i.e. after treating cells with phorbol ester.  Our findings implicate mRNA stabilization in the cytokine-mediated increase in eotaxin expression and strongly suggest a role for HuR in this effect. Proteasome inhibition increases HuR level, restores heat-inducible HSP72 expression and thermotolerance in WI-38 senescent human fibroblasts. This result is consistent with the proposed role of HuR in assisting mRNA export to the cytoplasm and in antagonizing its degradation. HuR immunoprecipitations were positive for RhoB mRNA indicating an in vivo association, and Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence demonstrated that HuR rapidly partitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after UVL In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message.  HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE) elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message. HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by adapter proteins which then facilitate nuclear export of the complex. In the cytosol HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message. The RNA binding protein HuR regulates the stability of many target mRNAs. Here, we report that HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATP analogue adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR in human (h) mesangial cells (MC).  HuR is an essential regulator of mesenchymal responses during lung branching. Our data reveals HuR as the first RBP identified to play a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. Here we demonstrated a relevance for miR-9 in HL pathogenesis and identified two new targets Dicer1 and HuR. We show that inhibition of miR-9 leads to derepression of DICER and HuR, which in turn results in a decrease in cytokine production by HL cells followed by an impaired ability to attract normal inflammatory cells. A conserved TGFβ1/HuR feedback circuit regulates the fibrogenic response in fibroblasts. Knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression. Our study here established a TGFβ1/HuR feedback circuit regulating the fibrogenic response in fibroblasts, and targeting this feedback loop is of great potential to control fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that increased stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The outcome of this analysis was a list of target genes regulated via HuR for their association (either increased or reduced) with the nuclear hnRNP A1-RNP complexes. The differentially enriched mRNAs were found to belong to GO categories relevant to biological processes anticipated for hnRNP A1 and HuR (such as transport, transcription, translation, apoptosis and cell cycle) indicating their concerted function in mRNA metabolism. Here, we show that overexpression of RNase L decreases cellular growth and downmodulates the RNA-binding protein, HuR, a regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In sum, our results indicate that NO stabilizes mRNA subsets in fibroblasts, identify HuR as an RBP implicated in the NO response, reveal that HuR alone is insufficient for stabilizing several mRNAs by NO, and show that HO-1 induction by NO is regulated by HuR. Suppression of HuR using siRNA resulted in an attenuation of the 3T3-L1 differentiation program, consistent with HuR control of the expression of mRNA ligand(s) critical to the differentiation process. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53. Our results reveal a positive feedback mechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the regulation of HuR during replicative senescence. In dividing cells, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with and stabilizes labile mRNAs encoding proliferative proteins, events that are linked to the increased cytoplasmic presence of HuR. On the basis of these observations, we postulated a role for HuR in promoting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. We propose that HuR contributes to regulating hVSMC growth and homeostasis in pathologies associated with vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Antiapoptotic function of RNA-binding protein HuR effected through prothymosin alpha. We report the antiapoptotic effect of RNA-binding protein HuR, a critical regulator of the post-transcriptional fate of target transcripts. Together, our data support a regulatory scheme whereby HuR binds the ProTalpha mRNA, elevates its cytoplasmic abundance and translation, and thereby elicits an antiapoptotic program. CARM1 represses replicative senescence by methylating HuR and thereby enhancing HuR's ability to regulate the turnover of cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-fos, SIRT1, and p16 mRNAs. HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. Together, these studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional mechanism involving competitive interactions between HuR and miR-200b that controls angiogenesis. Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes and luciferase reporter assays indicate that HuR antagonizes the suppressive activity of miR-200b, down-regulates miR-200b expression, and promotes VEGF-A expression. Here we present evidence that CUGBP1 and HuR jointly regulate the translation of occludin and play a crucial role in the maintenance of tight junction (TJ) integrity in the intestinal epithelial cell monolayer. These findings indicate that CUGBP1 represses occludin translation by increasing occludin mRNA recruitment to P-bodies, whereas HuR promotes occludin translation by blocking occludin mRNA translocation to P-bodies via the displacement of CUGBP1. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli. We focus on HuR's well-recognized implication in cancer and chronic inflammation, and discuss emerging studies linking HuR to cardiovascular, neurological, and muscular pathologies. We also discuss the progress, potential, and challenges of targeting HuR therapeutically. These results indicate that HuR regulates occludin mRNA translation through Chk2-dependent HuR phosphorylation and that this influence is crucial for maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity in the intestinal tract. The RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target mRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. HuR bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin translation. HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent HuR phosphorylation. 	['HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3\' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a "young cell" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a "younger" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3\' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.']
530b01a6970c65fa6b000008	Why is lock mass used in Orbitrap measurements?	Benzyldimethylphenylammonium was used as an internal lock mass. To compensate for drifts in instrument calibration, a compound of known mass is often employed. This 'lock mass' provides an internal mass standard in every spectrum. The use of mass calibrants (lock masses) to reduce the systematic error of mass-to-charge measurements has also been reported and, in some cases, incorporated in the instrument control software by the instrument manufacturers. We achieved absolute mass accuracies for intact proteins between 0.92 and 2.8 ppm using the "lock mass" mode of operation. Real time recalibration on the "lock mass" by corrections of mass shift removes mass error associated with calibration of the mass scale.

530f72fd329f5fcf1e000003	What is known about depression in caregivers of brain tumor patients?	Data suggest that patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours often have a high symptom burden and unmet needs for palliative care, and symptoms are hard to diagnose; patients suffer often and early from cognitive impairment but are rarely appropriately prepared concerning end-of-life wishes. This reflects on their caregivers' burden as well Reports of caregiver depressive symptoms and anxiety were lower when paired with higher reports of spirituality. Fifty-nine percent did not receive any financial aid for home care, 33% had increased risk for psychosomatic problems, 45% had anxiety, and 33% increased depression levels. The caregiver's quality of life was most strongly affected by the burden of care (p < .001) and the patient's mental state (p < .03). Depressive symptoms are common in cancer patients and their family caregivers (FCs).  The psychological burden induced by brain tumor is profound both for the sick person and for their own family. This particular tumor not only impacts patients' quality of life, but also reduces seriously the caregivers' quality of life.  Most caregivers experienced more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as compared with patients.  Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and treat, if necessary, caregivers' anxious or depressive symptomatology that impacts their quality of life, making them more helpless, frustrated and less able to handle the situation of disease and caregiving situation.  Group-based trajectory modeling identified high-decreasing (51.1 % of caregivers) and consistently low (48.9 %) depressive symptom trajectories, high-decreasing (75.5 %) and low-decreasing (24.5 %) anxiety trajectories, and high (37.5 %), moderate (40.9 %), and low-decreasing (21.6 %) caregiver burden trajectories. High depressive symptoms were associated with high trajectories for both anxiety and burden, lower caregivers age, income, and social support, and lower care recipient functioning. Studies suggest rates of depression and anxiety up to 48% in patients and up to 40% in caregivers, with many unmet needs and dissatisfaction with health care provider communication and information.  Caregivers try to react to the illness of their relatives by mobilizing their physical reaction and growing their self-esteem, but they live with a clinically significant impairment of their quality of life, and experience a deep level of anxiety and depression.  There was a trend for economic hardship to predict CG depressive symptoms at 4 months (P = 0.09), but not at diagnosis. Although previous research has documented the stress, depression, anxiety, and burden associated with caregiving, when these conditions occur is not known. Among patients, 30% reported anxious mood and 17% depressed mood on the HADS, while corresponding numbers for carers were 40% and 10%, respectively.  Among patients and carers, 30% and 40%, respectively, reported anxious moods and 17% and 10%, respectively, reported depressed moods on the HADS. Significant correlations were observed between the FACT-G and HADS subscales, particularly emotional well-being and anxiety, as well as physical and functional well-being and depression, and between patients' and their carers' quality of life.  Findings showed a link between care recipients' problem behaviors and caregivers' depressive symptoms, a relationship that has not been well established in oncology.  Care recipients' neuropsychiatric status consistently affected caregivers' depressive symptoms and burden, and assisting with activities of daily living affected burden related to caregivers' schedules and health. 	["Depression is common affecting up to 40% of caregivers of brain tumor patients. Depression is associated with poor quality of life of caregivers of brain tumor patients. Greater anxiety, patients’ emotional distress, economic hardship, lower caregivers’ age, lower income, less social support and lower patient functioning were associated with more caregivers’ depressive symptoms. Reports of caregiver depressive symptoms were lower when paired with higher reports of spirituality. It is important to monitor and treat caregiver's depression."]

5aa4f47cd6d6b54f7900000a	When is 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing used?	The different pipelines that may be used in 16S rRNA gene profiling of bacterial communities are known to have a significant impact on alpha and beta diversity measures and this may prevent direct comparison of results obtained in studies using different bioinformatic approaches to analyse raw sequences.   Metataxonomics tools analyze high-throughput sequencing data, primarily from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNAseq, to identify microorganisms and viruses within a complex mixture. Two biological methods were used, Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (RISA), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing with Illumina Miseq, to evaluate the discriminating power of soil bacterial communities.  The aim of this study was to assess the integration of different approaches, genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequencing), proteomic (MALDI-TOF MS) and metabolomic (1H-NMR), for the taxonomic and metabolic characterization of Lactobacillus species.

534289851eccfd0633000001	Can we use prodrug amifostine to protect healthy cell during chemotherapy?	CYP), a commonly prescribed chemotherapy drug, has multiple adverse side effects including alteration of taste. The effects on taste are a cause of concern for patients as changes in taste are often associated with loss of appetite, malnutrition, poor recovery and reduced quality of life. Amifostine is a cytoprotective agent that was previously shown to be effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis and nephrotoxicity. In vivo mesna and amifostine do not prevent chloroacetaldehyde nephrotoxicity in vitro Amifostine protects bone marrow from benzene-induced hematotoxicity in mice. Amifostine treatment in benzene-exposed mice significantly improved blood cell counts, and morphological and histopathological signs of hematotoxicity in the bone marrow as well as in the spleen. Moreover, amifostine prevented benzene-induced bone marrow and spleen cell apoptosis and rescinded the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by benzene exposure. Finally, amifostine significantly inhibited the levels of reactive oxidative species and lipid peroxidation induced by benzene exposure. Amifostine-antioxidant drug in anticancer therapy. .

It is a prodrug of free thiol (WR-1065) that may act as a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to cytotoxic drugs and binds to reactive metabolites of such drugs. Amifostine was originally developed as a radioprotective agent in a classified nuclear warfare project Preclinical studies demonstrate that amifostine has the potential to selectively protect normal tissues from the harmful effects of radiation without significantly protecting neoplastic tissue. The potential value of such an agent includes reducing treatment-related toxicity and the opportunity for radiation dose escalation in the curative treatment of cancer. An increasing number of human clinical trials have been conducted that define the toxicity profile and efficacy of radioprotection by amifostine when used during fractionated radiation therapy Radioprotective effects of amifostine.	['Effective radiotherapy for patients with cancer should include maximal tumor cell killing with minimal injury to normal tissue. However, current radiation doses that can be delivered without causing severe damage to surrounding normal tissues are often insufficient to eradicate a tumor. Recently, a number of agents have been developed to protect normal tissue from the harmful effects of antitumor therapies. The aminothiol amifostine (Ethyol; Alza Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA/US Bioscience, West Conshohocken, PA) has been the subject of extensive research as a prospective protector. While this drug has been approved for use to reduce toxicities associated with cisplatin, several studies also have demonstrated that amifostine protects normal tissues from both acute and late radiation damage without protecting the tumor. Consequently, higher radiation doses could be used with less than or equal risk to surrounding normal tissues.']

532ad23ad6d3ac6a34000011	What systems have been developed for the numbering of antibody residues?	IMGT is a high quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of any species which belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT consists of five databases, ten on-line tools and more than 8,000 HTML pages of Web resources. IMGT provides a common access to standardized data from genome, genetics, proteome and three-dimensional structures.  amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files. Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT(®) databases and tools allows one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures. This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles).  Kabat Database was initially started in 1970 to determine the combining site of antibodies based on the available amino acid sequences at that time. comparative analysis of the main-chain conformation of the L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 hypervariable regions in 17 immunoglobulin structures that have been accurately determined at high resolution is described. This involves 79 hypervariable regions in all. We also analysed a part of the H3 region in 12 of the 15 VH domains considered here. On the basis of the residues at key sites the 79 hypervariable regions can be assigned to one of 18 different canonical structures. We show that 71 of these hypervariable regions have a conformation that is very close to what can be defined as a "standard" conformation of each canonical structure. These standard conformations are described in detail. The other eight hypervariable regions have small deviations from the standard conformations that, in six cases, involve only the rotation of a single peptide group the basis of comparative studies of known antibody structures and sequences it has been argued that there is a small repertoire of main-chain conformations for at least five of the six hypervariable regions of antibodies, and that the particular conformation adopted is determined by a few key conserved residues.

51602609298dcd4e5100003a	What is the role of TRH in hypertension?	We recently showed that diencephalic TRH may mediate the central leptin-induced pressor effect that central TRH participates in the hypertension induced by body weight gain probably through its well-known action on sympathetic activity. Five polymorphisms in five genes, CAST(calpastatin), LIPC (hepatic lipase), SLC4A1 (band 3 anion transporter), TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), and VWF (von Willebrand factor), were significantly associated with both blood pressure variation and hypertension. We previously reported that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) precursor gene overexpression induces hypertension in the normal rat and that spontaneously hypertensive rats have central TRH hyperactivity with increased TRH synthesis and release and an elevated TRH receptor number. We propose that because leptin produces central TRH synthesis and release, obesity may induce hypertension through TRH system activation and that the TRH-leptin interaction may thus contribute to the strong association between hypertension and obesity. We have described that TRH overexpression induces hypertension in a normal rat, which was reversed by TRH antisense treatment.  his treatment also reduces the central TRH hyperactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normalizes blood pressure. Our findings support the hypothesis that the TRHR gene participates in the etiopathogenesis of essential hypertension. Recently, we described that the TRH precursor gene overexpression induces hypertension in the normal rat. In addition, we published that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have central extrahypothalamic TRH hyperactivity with increased TRH synthesis and release and an elevated TRH receptor number. the encephalic renin-angiotensin system seems to be crucial in the development and/or maintenance of hypertension in SHR, we investigated the effect of antisense inhibition of TRH on that system and found that TRH antisense treatment significantly diminished the elevated diencephalic angiotensin II (Ang II) content in the SHR without any effect in control animals, suggesting that the Ang II system is involved in the TRH cardiovascular effects. he central TRH system seems to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of hypertension in this model of essential hypertension ong-term treatment with enalapril (5 mg/kg twice daily), which was effective in inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity by more than 50%, decreased arterial blood pressure and preoptic area TRH content of SHR, whereas another vasodilator, diltiazem (10 mg/kg every 8 hours), failed to produce a similar change the pressor effect of intravenous TRH is mediated primarily by a stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Adrenal medullectomy appears to enhance the blood pressure response to intravenous TRH. Activation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors seems to contribute to the blood pressure increasing effect of intravenous TRH in medullectomized animals. Centrally administered thyrotropin-releasing hormone exerts a well documented hypertensive effect. These results provide evidence for a role of endogenous brain thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the maintenance of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats the development of hypertension paralleled increases in brain receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) The results suggest that in addition to the brain, TRH receptors in the spinal cord of SHR rats are also up-regulated and may also play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. The results provide, for the first time, evidence for a parallel increase in the density of brain TRH receptors with elevation of blood pressure, and suggest that brain TRH receptors may play an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension.

551177626a8cde6b72000005	What is the effect of resveratrol on mTOR activity?	Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by promoting the interaction between mTOR and DEPTOR Here, we show that RSV inhibits insulin- and leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling in C2C12 fibroblasts via a Sirt1-independent mechanism Treating C2C12 cells with RSV dramatically inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt, S6 kinase, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but had little effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and activation of the p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway RSV treatment also partially blocked mTOR and S6 kinase phosphorylation in TSC1/2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of an inhibitory site downstream of TSC1/2 Taken together, our studies reveal that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR interaction and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively regulates mTOR activity Recent studies suggest that modulation of the mTOR signalling pathway could play an important role in mediating the beneficial effects of RSV.  Resveratrol inhibits the mTOR mitogenic signaling evoked by oxidized LDL in smooth muscle cells esveratrol blocked the oxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and strongly inhibited both the DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC At concentrations that inhibit mTOR, resveratrol suppresses cellular senescence Here we demonstrated that, at cytostatic, near-toxic concentrations, resveratrol inhibited S6 phosphorylation and prevented the senescence morphology in human cells Resveratrol downregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human U251 glioma cells On the other hand, RSV significantly increased the association between mTOR and its inhibitor, DEPTOR Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by targeting DEPTOR Recent studies suggest that suppressing the signaling pathway mediated by mTOR, a well-known energy sensor that integrates various hormonal, nutrient and environmental signals to regulate cell growth, metabolism and survival, could play an important role in mediating the beneficial effect of RSV Resveratrol engages AMPK to attenuate ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons and inhibits incision-induced acute and chronic pain Our results demonstrate that resveratrol profoundly inhibits ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion and that these effects are mediated by AMPK activation and independent of sirtuin activity Resveratrol enhances the antitumor effects of temozolomide in glioblastoma via ROS-dependent AMPK-TSC-mTOR signaling pathway Resveratrol enhances the anti-tumor activity of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines mainly by suppressing rapamycin-induced AKT signaling. Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by promoting the interaction between mTOR and DEPTOR. Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1. Resveratrol inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR. Resveratrol inhibits the mTOR mitogenic signaling evoked by oxidized LDL in smooth muscle cells. Resveratrol also alleviated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and up-regulation of PTEN expression. Resveratrol blocked the oxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and strongly inhibited both the DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC. Resveratrol reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin further enhanced resveratrol-induced cell death. Resveratrol downregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human U251 glioma cells. Our results demonstrate that resveratrol profoundly inhibits ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion and that these effects are mediated by AMPK activation and independent of sirtuin activity. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner. We conclude that resveratrol is an inhibitor of global protein synthesis, and that this effect is mediated through modulation of mTOR-dependent and independent signaling. RSV treatment has no effect on the expression levels of mTOR, raptor and DEPTOR, but greatly promotes the interaction between mTOR and its inhibitor DEPTOR. Taken together, our studies reveal that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR interaction and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively regulates mTOR activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling was greatly reduced in cells in which the expression levels of DEPTOR were suppressed by RNAi Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1 The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner However, most frequently, RSV is found to inhibit the activity of the mTOR pathway proteins, and to activate AMPK and LKB1, which can suppress mTOR signalling Over the past few years, numerous studies have suggested that suppressing the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation, may provide a key mechanism underlying the anticarcinogenic properties of resveratrol Resveratrol blocks specifically this pathway, thereby inhibiting oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation.  Resveratrol causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptotic cell death in various types of cancer cells Resveratrol decreased both the expression and phosphorylation of Akt  Modulation of the AMPK, Akt and mTOR pathways RSV (2.5-5 μM) inhibited clonogenic survival of PC3 and 22RV1 cells but not of normal prostate PNT1A cells RSV enhanced IR-activation of ATM and AMPK but inhibited basal and IR-induced phosphorylation of Akt Our results suggest that RSV arrests cell cycle, promotes apoptosis and sensitizes PrCa cells to IR likely through a desirable dual action to activate the ATM-AMPK-p53-p21(cip1)/p27(kip1) and inhibit the Akt signalling pathways Resveratrol pre-treatment reduces early inflammatory responses induced by status epilepticus via mTOR signaling Over the past few years, numerous studies have suggested that suppressing the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation, may provide a key mechanism underlying the anticarcinogenic properties of resveratrol. It has been found that resveratrol targets multiple components of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase(PI3K)/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, including PI3K, Akt, PTEN, and DEPTOR, suggesting that this natural compound and its derivatives may offer a promising new cancer treatment.  Autophagic cell death induced by resveratrol depends on the Ca(2+)/AMPK/mTOR pathway in A549 cells In conclusion, we demonstrate that resveratrol-induced A549 cell death was mediated by the process of autophagic cell death via Ca(2+)/AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway.

59d09a0cbc32f93e6d000001	What is the difference between ganglion mother cells (GMC) and intermediate neural precursor cells (INP) in Drosophila?	 Neuroblasts (NBs) give rise to differentiated neurons and glia via intermediate precursors called GMCs or INPs. Expression of E(spl)mγ and m8, but not of dpn, depends on Notch signalling from the GMC/INP daughter to the NB.  A new role of Klumpfuss in establishing cell fate during the GMC asymmetric cell division. Studies in the Drosophila embryonic NB4-2 lineage have suggested that the transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu) functions within embryonic neuroblast lineages to differentiate between the identities of two adjacent ganglion mother cells (GMCs) Unexpectedly, in this lineage, klu is necessary for differentiating between the fates of the two neurons born from a unique GMC Additionally, our results demonstrate that Klu operates in the GMC and/or in the newly born neuron, but not in the neuroblast.  Neural progenitors of the Drosophila larval brain, called neuroblasts, can be divided into distinct populations based on patterns of proliferation and differentiation. In both vertebrates and insects, neurons typically arise from neural stem cells or terminally dividing intermediate progenitors. Each NB has a unique identity and undergoes repeated cell divisions to produce several smaller secondary precursor cells, ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each GMC divides once to produce two neurons and/or glia, thereby generating a specific lineage of neurons/glia. Type I neuroblasts produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce differentiated progeny, while type II neuroblasts produce self-renewing intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and thus generate lineages containing many more progeny. In the Drosophila CNS, neuroblasts undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions, whereas their progeny, ganglion mother cells (GMCs), divide asymmetrically to generate terminal postmitotic neurons. NBs divide asymmetrically to regenerate themselves and produce a secondary precursor cell called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides to produce neurons and glia. Each of the approximately 25 NBs per hemisegment undergoes repeated asymmetric divisions to produce, on average, 5-10 smaller ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each GMC, in turn, divides to produce two neurons. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. In the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, secondary precursor cells-ganglion mother cells (GMCs)-divide and produce postmitotic neurons that take on different cell fates. The bipotential Ganglion Mother Cells, or GMCs, in the Drosophila CNS asymmetrically divide to generate two distinct post-mitotic neurons.

5a82fc89faa1ab7d2e000028	Which yeast nucleosomes are preferentially marked by H2A.Z?	The H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes have different sequence preferences. The shifted peaks coincide with DNA regions interacting with the histone loops. Deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z at gene bodies regulates transcription by modifying chromatin accessibility in plants. We showed that H2A.Z preferentially associated with H3K4me3 at promoters, while it was found with H3K27me3 at enhancers, and that H2A.Z deposition negatively correlated with gene expression. In addition, we demonstrated that H2A.Z represses gene expression by establishing low gene accessibility at +1 nucleosome and maintaining high gene accessibility at -1 nucleosome. We further showed that the high measures of gene responsiveness correlate with the H2A.Z-associated closed +1 nucleosome structure. In particular, replacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z has been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; Using genome-wide nucleosome maps and histone variant occupancy in the mouse liver, we show that the majority of genes were associated with a single prominent H2A.Z containing nucleosome in their promoter region Proximity of H2A.Z containing nucleosome to the transcription start site influences gene expression levels in the mammalian liver and brain The genes with no detectable H2A.Z showed lowest expression level, whereas H2A.Z was positioned closer to the TSS of genes with higher expression levels. The proximity of histone variant H2A.Z, but not H3.3 to the TSS, over seven consecutive nucleosomes, was correlated with expression  Our results suggest that gene expression levels in vivo are determined by accessibility of the TSS and proximity of H2A.Z. We also find that human H2A.Z nucleosomes protect only approximately 120 bp of DNA from MNase digestion and exhibit specific sequence preferences, suggesting a novel mechanism of nucleosome organization for the H2A.Z variant. Variant histone H2A.Z is globally localized to the promoters of inactive yeast genes and regulates nucleosome positioning. We have identified 4,862 small regions--typically one or two nucleosomes wide--decorated with H2A.Z. Those "Z loci" are predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all across the genome. Genome-wide profiling of Anp32e revealed a remarkable co-occupancy between Anp32e and H2A.Z. Cells overexpressing Anp32e displayed a strong global H2A.Z loss at the +1 nucleosomes, whereas cells depleted of Anp32e displayed a moderate global H2A.Z increase at the +1 nucleosomes. This suggests that Anp32e may help to resolve the non-nucleosomal H2A.Z aggregates and also facilitate the removal of H2A.Z at the +1 nucleosomes, and the latter may help RNA polymerase II to pass the first nucleosomal barrier. Although distinct epigenetic marks correlate with different chromatin states, how they are integrated within single nucleosomes to generate combinatorial signals remains largely unknown. We report the successful implementation of single molecule tools constituting fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), pulse interleave excitation-based Förster resonance energy transfer (PIE-FRET) and fluorescence lifetime imaging-based FRET (FLIM-FRET) to elucidate the composition of single nucleosomes containing histone variant H2A.Z (Htz1p in yeast) in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that yeast nucleosomes containing Htz1p are primarily composed of H4 K12ac and H3 K4me3 but not H3 K36me3 and that these patterns are conserved in mammalian cells.

5713394af9287de436000001	Which is the underlying mechanism for exon skipping used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy?	Antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy is a promising therapeutic approach that uses short DNA-like molecules called antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to skip over/splice out the mutated part of the gene to produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein many DMD patients need exon skipping of multiple exons in order to restore the reading frame, depending on how many base pairs the mutated exon(s) and adjacent exons have. Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD. Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), the disrupted DMD reading frame is restored, allowing generation of partially functional dystrophin and conversion of a severe Duchenne into a milder Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype.  Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting specific exons the DMD reading frame is restored and partially functional dystrophins are produced.

60290f741cb411341a00010b	What is the role of Adamts18 in hormone receptor signaling?	The secreted protease Adamts18 links hormone action to activation of the mammary stem cell niche. Estrogens and progesterone control breast development and carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of luminal cells in the mammary epithelium. How they control the extracellular matrix, important to breast physiology and tumorigenesis, remains unclear. Here we report that both hormones induce the secreted protease Adamts18 in myoepithelial cells by controlling Wnt4 expression with consequent paracrine canonical Wnt signaling activation. Adamts18 is required for stem cell activation, has multiple binding partners in the basement membrane and interacts genetically with the basal membrane-specific proteoglycan, Col18a1, pointing to the basement membrane as part of the stem cell niche. In vitro, ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin; in vivo, Adamts18 deletion causes increased collagen deposition during puberty, which results in impaired Hippo signaling and reduced Fgfr2 expression both of which control stem cell function.

604d41ba94d57fd879000005	What is the function of kisspeptin in the brain?	 Kisspeptin is the most potent factor known to induce GnRH release.  Kisspeptin preserves mitochondrial function by inducing mitophagy and autophagy in aging rat brain hippocampus  Kisspeptin is a neuropeptide that plays an integral role in the regulation of energy intake and reproduction by acting centrally on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis Intraperitoneal Treatment of Kisspeptin Suppresses Appetite and Energy Expenditure and Alters Gastrointestinal Hormones in Mice. The kisspeptin system, a known regulator of reproduction in fish, The action of kisspeptin in the regulation of gonadal function has been widely studied, but little is known as concerns its function in limbic brain structures. Kisspeptin signaling may also serve diverse functions outside of the classical realm of reproductive neuroendocrinology, including the regulation of metastasis in certain cancers, vascular dynamics, placental physiology, and perhaps even higher-order brain function. Kisspeptin signaling in the brain has been implicated in mediating the negative feedback action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion, generating the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, triggering and guiding the tempo of sexual maturation at puberty, controlling seasonal reproduction, and restraining reproductive activity during lactation. SION: Taken together, our data demonstrate a previously unknown role for kisspeptin in the modulation of functional brain connectivity and networks, integrating these with reproductive hormones and behaviors. Our f Using electrophysiology in an intact brain preparation, we show that a relatively brief treatment with 100 nM of kisspeptin had a long-lasting stimulatory effect on the electrical activity of an extrahypothalamic population of GnRH neurons. is wide consensus that kisspeptin signaling in the brain is essential, providing the impetus to GnRH neurons to awaken at puberty and reigning the activity of these neurons when discretion is advised. We celebrate th he present study aimed to identify kisspeptin neurons in the bovine hypothalamus, clarifying that a central mechanism is also present in the cattle brain, as kisspeptin is known to play an important role in the stimulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)/gonadotropin secretion in other mammals. To ch ide here a review of kisspeptin actions on neuronal populations throughout the brain including the magnocellular oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, and cells within the arcuate nucleus, hippocampus, and amygdala. The actions lations of kisspeptin neurones in the brain may control two modes of GnRH release to time the onset of puberty and regulate oestrous cyclicity in rats and mice. One popu owever, in spite of wide kisspeptin receptor distribution in the brain, especially in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, the research focus has mostly been confined to the kisspeptin regulation on GnRH neurons. Here, The kisspeptins activate the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54 and are strongly implicated in puberty onset and in regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis in mammals. In addition, kisspeptin nerve terminals and receptors are found in other hypothalamic area suggesting that kisspeptins are involved in regulation of other yet unknown homeostatic or neuroendocrine functions. Kisspeptin neurons directly innervate and stimulate GnRH neurons, which are the final common pathway through which the brain regulates reproduction. Kisspeptin neurons express the estrogen receptor and the androgen receptor, and these cells are direct targets for the action of gonadal steroids in both male and female animals. Kisspeptin neurons are sexually differentiated with respect to cell number and transcriptional activity in certain brain nuclei, and some kisspeptin neurons express other cotransmitters, including dynorphin and neurokinin B (whose physiological significance is unknown). Kisspeptin (a product of the Kiss1 gene) and its receptor (GPR54 or Kiss1r) have emerged as key players in the regulation of reproduction. Mutations in humans or genetically targeted deletions in mice of either Kiss1 or Kiss1r cause profound hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The kiss1 gene product kisspeptin is now considered to be an essential regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in most vertebrate species. Kisspeptin preserves mitochondrial function by inducing mitophagy and autophagy in aging rat brain hippocampus and human neuronal cell line. In the brain, Kiss1 gene is mainly expressed in the hypothalamic region, but KissR gene is widely distributed throughout the brain, suggesting that kisspeptin-KissR system may be involved in not only reproductive, but also non-reproductive functions. Kisspeptins are a family of neuropeptides encoded by Kiss1 and Kiss2 genes, and participate in neuroendocrine regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion through activating their receptor, Kiss1r (or GPR54). The results demonstrated that the action of kisspeptin-13 on the facilitation of passive avoidance learning and memory consolidation is mediated, at least in part, through interactions of the α2-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, 5-HT2 serotonergic, muscarinic cholinergic and GABA-A-ergic receptor systems and nitric oxide.

54fc48bb6ea36a810c000002	How are induced pluripotent stem cells used in the study and treatment of cardiovascular diseases?	iPSC technology holds tremendous promises for therapeutic cardiovascular regeneration because of the cells' unlimited capacity for proliferation and differentiation into all cell lineages. The iPSCs can be generated from somatic cells of patients with a genetic basis for their disease so as to understand the pathobiology of the disorder. This disease modeling can be adapted to high-throughput screens to discover new therapeutic molecules. Finally, the iPSC technology may enable personalized cell therapies, while avoiding the ethical concerns surrounding human embryonic stem cells. Intensive efforts are underway to develop reliable methods to guide stem cell differentiation into cardiovascular lineages in the treatment of peripheral artery disease and heart diseases. Studies of disease pathogenesis and drug discovery using iPSC technology shall advance the discovery of novel treatments for cardiovascular diseases. Induced pluripotent stem cells: how they will change the practice of cardiovascular medicine. Since the first description of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, these cells have garnered tremendous interest for their potential use in patient-specific analysis and therapy. The promise of successful therapies with stem cells to treat these conditions has remained elusive to the scientific community. However, recent advances in this field have opened new opportunities for regenerative cardiac therapy. Transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells has the potential to alleviate heart disease. Since the initial derivation of human embryonic stem cells, significant progress has been made in the generation and characterization of enriched cardiomyocytes and the demonstration of the ability of these cardiomyocytes to survive, integrate, and function in animal models. The scope of therapeutic potential from pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has been further expanded with the invention of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be induced to generate functional cardiomyocytes for regenerative cardiac therapy in a patient specific manner. The reprogramming technology has also inspired the recent discovery of direct conversion of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells, which may allow endogenous cardiac repair. Regenerative cardiac therapy with human pluripotent stem cells is now moving closer to clinic testing.  Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study "disease in a dish" within a defined genetic and environmental background. Patient-derived iPSCs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. They also provide an exciting opportunity for drug discovery and drug repurposing for disorders with a known molecular basis including childhood onset heart disease, particularly cardiac genetic disorders. The in vitro production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. In this review, we discuss the use of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for drug discovery and cardiotoxicity screening, as well as current hurdles that must be overcome for wider clinical applications of this promising approach. The progress made toward the generation of induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells hold great potential for future use in myocardial repair. Cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite the improvement shown in the prognosis of patients with acute MI, there remains still a significant mortality risk. Since the main underlying problem after an MI is the loss of cardiomyocytes and microvasculature, treatment strategies aimed at preserving or regenerating myocardial tissue have been examined as potential therapeutic modalities. Toward this goal, many cell types are being investigated as potent sources of cardiomyocytes for cell transplantation. The discovery that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by overexpression of a combination of transcription factors bears the potential to spawn a wealth of new applications in both preclinical and clinical cardiovascular research. Disease modeling, which is accomplished by deriving iPSC lines from patients affected by heritable diseases and then studying the pathophysiology of the diseases in somatic cells differentiated from these patient-specific iPSC lines, is the so far most advanced of these applications. Long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future. Test systems based on cells derived from iPSC might prove beneficial to screen for novel cardiovascular drugs or unwanted drug side effects and to individualize medical therapy. The application of iPSC for cell therapy of cardiovascular disorders, albeit promising, will only become feasible if the problem of biological safety of these cells will be mastered. The major goal within the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine is to replace lost or damaged cardiac muscle and coronaries following ischaemic disease. At present, de novo cardiomyocytes can be generated either in vitro, for cell transplantation or disease modelling using directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, or in vivo via direct reprogramming of resident adult cardiac fibroblast or ectopic stimulation of resident cardiac stem or progenitor cells.  Stem cells in cardiovascular regeneration: from preservation of endogenous repair to future cardiovascular therapies. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed countries. This review summarizes current pre-clinical and clinical evidence for the potential role and mechanisms of action of stem and progenitor cells in vascular and cardiac repair and regeneration. Apart from cell transplantation strategies, approaches to maintain stem cell niche function and targeting mobilization/recruitment of specific stem/progenitor cell populations may aid in preserving vascular and cardiac function. Moreover, with the use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, the field of regenerative medicine is entering a new era. Potential applications of induced pluripotent stem cells and direct reprogrammed cells as well as recent developments in tissue engineering are discussed. The successful derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by dedifferentiation of somatic cells offers significant potential to overcome obstacles in the field of cardiovascular disease. hiPSC derivatives offer incredible potential for new disease models and regenerative medicine therapies. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has led to many advances in the areas of directed cell differentiation and characterization. New methods for generating iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes provide an invaluable resource for the study of certain cardiovascular disorders. This review highlights the current technology in this field, its application thus far to the study of genetic disorders of the RAS/MAPK pathway and long-QT syndrome (LQTS), and future directions for the field. The use of cardiomyocytes derived from patients with LEOPARD syndrome and LQTS has shed light on the molecular mechanisms of disease and validated their use as reliable human disease models. The use of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study genetic cardiovascular disorders will enable a deeper and more applicable understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease, as well as improving our ability to achieve successful cell-based therapies. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) are promising for treatment of vascular diseases. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells potentially provide a unique resource for generating patient-specific cardiomyocytes to study cardiac disease mechanisms and treatments. Cardiovascular progenitor cells (CVPCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold great promise for the study of cardiovascular development and cell-based therapy of heart diseases, but their applications are challenged by the difficulties in their efficient generation and stable maintenance	['The major goal within the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine is to replace lost or damaged cardiac muscle and coronaries following ischaemic disease.

The production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study "disease in a dish" within a defined genetic and environmental background. Patient-derived iPSCs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. Long-QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future. The use of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to study genetic cardiovascular disorders will enable a deeper and more applicable understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease, as well as improving our ability to achieve successful cell-based therapies.']

P-bodies involved in RNA metabolism cytoplasmic RNA granules called processing bodies (P-bodies) The 5'-to-3' mRNA degradation machinery localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), which are non-membranous structures found in all eukaryotes.  This analysis demonstrates the dual role of P-bodies as decay sites and storage areas under regular and stress conditions.  mRNA P-bodies (processing bodies) harbour much of the mRNA decay machinery P-bodies contain the mRNA decay and translational repression machineries  P-bodies belong to a large family of RNA granules that are associated with post-transcriptional gene regulation, conserved from yeast to mammals, and influence biological processes ranging from germ cell development to neuronal plasticity. In eukaryotic cells, components of the 5' to 3' mRNA degradation machinery can undergo a rapid phase transition. The resulting cytoplasmic foci are referred to as processing bodies (P-bodies).  Processing bodies (P bodies, PB) are cytoplasmic protein complexes involved in degradation and translational arrest of mRNA. The mRNA processing body (P-body) is a cellular structure that regulates the stability of cytoplasmic mRNA. while most other messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are stored away in stress granules or degraded in processing bodies (P-bodies). Numerous mRNAs are degraded in processing bodies (P bodies) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Processing (P)-bodies are cytoplasmic RNA protein aggregates responsible for the storage, degradation, and quality control of translationally repressed messenger RNAs in eukaryotic cells. in P-bodies (PBs), where translationally silenced mRNAs are deposited,  Processing bodies (P-bodies) are cytoplasmatic mRNP granules containing non-translating mRNAs and proteins from the mRNA decay and silencing machineries.  The control of mRNA translation and degradation is mediated in part by a set of proteins that can inhibit translation and promote decapping, as well as function in the assembly of cytoplasmic mRNP granules referred to as processing bodies (P-bodies).

58c66a4b02b8c60953000025	Which are the main brain dysfunctions caused by hyperbilirubinemia?	Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and classical kernicterus are clinical manifestations of moderate to severe hyperbilirubinemia whenever bilirubin levels exceed the capacity of the brain defensive mechanisms in preventing its entrance and cytotoxicity. In such circumstances and depending on the associated co-morbidities, bilirubin accumulation may lead to short- or long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, which may include deficits in auditory, cognitive, and motor processing. Neuronal cell death, astrocytic reactivity, and microglia activation are part of the bilirubin-induced pathogenesis.  Reduced Myelination and Increased Glia Reactivity Resulting from Severe Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and kernicterus has been used to describe moderate to severe neurologic dysfunction observed in children exposed to excessive levels of total serum bilirubin (TSB) during the neonatal period. Histologic studies of brain tissue demonstrate that the onset of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by seizures, leads to alterations in myelination and glia reactivity.  Thus, kernicterus in this model displays not only axonal damage but also myelination deficits and glial activation in different brain regions that are usually related to the neurologic sequelae observed after severe hyperbilirubinemia. Advances in the care of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia have led to a decreased incidence of kernicterus. However, neonatal exposure to high levels of bilirubin continues to cause severe motor symptoms and cerebral palsy (CP). Exposure to moderate levels of unconjugated bilirubin may also cause damage to the developing central nervous system, specifically the basal ganglia and cerebellum.  High levels of serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in newborns are associated with axonal damage and glial reactivity that may contribute to subsequent neurologic injury and encephalopathy (kernicterus).  Hyperbilirubinemia remains one of the most frequent clinical diagnoses in the neonatal period. This condition may lead to the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in the central nervous system, causing nerve cell damage by molecular and cellular mechanisms that are still being clarified.  "Kernicterus" is a term currently used to describe bilirrubin induced brain injury in the neuro-pathological studies. This is a confusing term and nowadays we prefer bilirrubin encephalopathy or bilirrubin induced neurological dysfunction.  We then review the possible alteration of the neuroprotective and trophic barrier functions in the course of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunctions resulting from hyperbilirubinemia. It has been suggested recently that there is an association between hyperbilirubinemia and long-term neurologic dysfunctions. In this article, we review computational insights into the brain dysfunctions underlying Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and dystonia, with particular foci on dysfunctions of the dopamine system, basal ganglia pathways, and neuronal oscillations. Hyperbilirubinemia may accompany harmful effects such as jaundice, brain dysfunction, and pharmacokinetic alterations of drugs. Neonatal jaundice is a common cause of sensorneural hearing loss in children.We aimed to detect the neurotoxic effects of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia on brain stem and auditory tract by auditory brain stem evoked response (ABR) which could predict early effects of hyperbilirubinemia.This case-control study was performed on newborns with pathologic hyperbilirubinemia For example, the mean latencies time of wave I was significantly higher in right ear of the case group than in controls (2.16 ± 0.26 vs. 1.77 ± 0.15 milliseconds, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001).Pathologic hyperbilirubinemia causes acute disorder on brain stem function; therefore, early diagnosis of neonatal jaundice for prevention of bilirubin neurotoxic effects is essential Wave amplitudes are valuable BAER variables to detect functional impairment of the brainstem and auditory pathway in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and are recommended to be used in assessing bilirubin neurotoxicity to the neonatal brain.<CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2013 European Paediatric Neurology Society Histologic studies of brain tissue demonstrate that the onset of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by seizures, leads to alterations in myelination and glia reactivity [Characteristics of auditory brain stem response in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia induced by different causes]. Excessive hyperbilirubinemia in human neonates can cause permanent dysfunction of the auditory system, as assessed with brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). A recent surge in reported cases of classical kernicterus, due in part to earlier hospital discharge and relaxation of treatment criteria for hyperbilirubinemia, and new reports of hyperbilirubinemia-induced auditory dysfunction using evoked potential based infant testing and hearing screening, underscore the need to better understand how hyperbilirubinemia causes brain damage in some infants, especially because the damage is preventable. Pathologic hyperbilirubinemia causes acute disorder on brain stem function; therefore, early diagnosis of neonatal jaundice for prevention of bilirubin neurotoxic effects is essential.	['Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and classical kernicterus are the main dysfunctions of hyperbilirubinemia, whenever bilirubin levels exceed the capacity of the brain defensive mechanisms in preventing its entrance and cytotoxicity. Bilirubin accumulation may lead to deficits in auditory, cognitive, and motor processing, due to neuronal cell death, reduced myelination and glial activation.']

During infectious processes, the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), gamma interferon (IFNγ) and chemokines orchestrates the anti-infectious innate immune response. However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome.

5a003e0a966455904c000001	What is the function of the TFIIS transcriptional factor (Dst1) in yeast?	TFIIS, an elongation factor encoded by DST1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, stimulates transcript cleavage in arrested RNA polymerase II. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TFIIS can bind the Cdk8 module and SAGA in cell-free extracts Members of the SAGA and Mediator complexes are partners of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS. It is proposed that TFIIS and the Spt8-containing form of SAGA co-operate to rescue RNA polymerase II from unproductive elongation complexes, and that the Cdk8 module temporarily blocks transcription during transcript cleavage. TFIIS promotes the intrinsic ability of RNA polymerase II to cleave the 3'-end of the newly synthesized RNA. TFIIS and Rpb9 are essential when the cells are challenged with microtubule-destabilizing drugs; While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability. We propose that TFIIS is required under stress conditions and that TFIIS is important for the transition between initiation and elongation in vivo. The eukaryotic transcript elongation factor TFIIS is encoded by a nonessential gene, PPR2, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide location analysis reveals a role of TFIIS in RNA polymerase III transcription. TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II) Recent studies revealed that TFIIS has also a role in Pol II transcription initiation.  TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel class of targets. These data provide strong in vivo and in vitro evidence in favor of a role of TFIIS as a general Pol III transcription factor. Transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) stimulates RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II by allowing backtracked enzymes to resume transcription elongation. TFIIS is required for the balanced expression of the genes encoding ribosomal components under transcriptional stress. We discuss the effect of transcriptional stress on ribosome biogenesis and propose that TFIIS contributes to prevent a transcriptional imbalance between rDNA and RP genes. Here, we investigated the role of nascent transcript cleavage stimulation activity on the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity in yeast. TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II). A mild but systematic increase in RNA polymerase occupancy and a strict dependency on the transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (Dst1) also suggest a slower rate of translocation or higher probability of transcriptional stalling in this mutation. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s)..

604cda2f94d57fd879000004	what is the effect of Bisphenol A in the body?	Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disruptor compound that exhibits estrogenic activit Bisphenol A (BPA), a compound used in the manufacturing of plastics and epoxy resins, is an endocrine disruptor with significant adverse impact on the human's health Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine disruptor that affects male fertility Bisphenol A, an endocrine-disruptor compund, that modulates the immune response to infections. Although the relationship between BPA exposure and increased risk of obesity and diabetes has been noted Bisphenols are increasingly recognized as environmental pollutants with endocrine-disrupting potential. In conclusion, the present study using a robust experimental study design, has shown that developmental exposure to 25 μg/kg bw/day bisphenol A can cause adverse effects on fertility (decreased sperm count), neurodevelopment (masculinization of spatial learning in females) and lead to increased female body weight late in life. In conclusion, the adverse effect of bisphenol A on male reproduction may be due to induction of oxidative stress in sperm. Results show that Bisphenol A exposure reduced body weight and food intake. In this study we evaluated the effect of fetal exposure to bisphenol A, which mimics estrogenic activity, on aggressive behavior and hormonal change in male mice. By virtue of its binding to steroid hormone receptors, bisphenol A (BPA, the unconjugated bioactive monomer) is hypothesized to be estrogenic when present in sufficient quantities in the body, raising concerns that widespread exposure to BPA may impact human health. To bet Bisphenol A [BPA, 2,2-bis(4-hydoxyphenyl)propane], an industrial chemical used in the production of polycarbonate, epoxide resin, and polyarylate, is considered to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical. BPA ma Bisphenol A (BPA) can disrupt glucose homeostasis and impair pancreatic islet function; however, the mechanisms behind these effects are poorly understood. Mal Bisphenol A (BPA) is a small molecular weight endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) that is used in the production of plastics with deleterious effects on various body systems while gallic acid (GA) is a known antioxidant capable of ameliorating EDC-induced perturbations. In this Bisphenol A may affect reproductive and neurological development; however, opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on bisphenol A (EFSA J, 13, 2015 and 3978) concluded that none of the available studies were robust enough to provide a point of departure for setting a tolerable daily intake for bisphenol A. The present study aimed to summarize the general effects of prenatal and postnatal Bisphenol A exposure on glucose metabolism focusing on animal studies and review the recent investigations on Bisphenol A -induced epigenetic perturbations that affect the normal glucose and lipid homeostasis and lead to type 2 diabetes. Regardless of dextran sulfate sodium treatment, bisphenol-A reduced levels of tryptophan and several metabolites associated with decreased inflammation in the colon. This is the first study to show that bisphenol-A treatment alone can reduce microbiota metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids in the colon which may be associated with increased colonic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease. Mesencephalic neurodegeneration in the orally administered bisphenol A-caused hyperactive rats. Bisphenol-A has been shown to exert estrogenic activity in the colon and alter intestinal function, but the role that xenoestrogens, such as bisphenol-A , play in colonic inflammation has been previously described but with conflicting results. Decreased intake of sweetened water was seen in females from the highest bisphenol A dose group, also a possible sign of masculinization. Decreased sperm count was found at the lowest bisphenol Considerable data from rodent studies suggest that low doses of bisphenol A affect reproduction, lipid metabolism and neurological development, usually following intrauterine or postnatal exposure. Some human studies suggest that bisphenol A causes coronary heart disease, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and has harmful effects on reproduction and development. Bisphenol A, one of the industrial chemicals used in plastics and in the coating of dishes and medical equipment, behaves as an endocrine disruptor in the human body. Bisphenol A induces hypothalamic down-regulation of the the cannabinoid receptor 1 and anorexigenic effects in male mice. This observation suggests that Bisphenol A induces activation of anorexigenic signals via down-regulation of the hypothalamic cannabinoid receptor 1 with negative impact on food intake. The results indicated that bisphenol A induces oxidative stress in the liver of rats by decreasing the antioxidant enzymes. Bisphenol A, an environmental contaminant, widely used as a monomer in polycarbonate plastics, has been shown to cause abnormalities in liver of rats and mice. Bisphenol A is a weak estrogen and has been implicated as an "endocrine disruptor". Bisphenol A induces reactive oxygen species generation in the liver of male rats. BPA is known for many negative effects on the human body; for instance it acts as an xenoestrogen and influences fertility and gestation and might also have carcinogenic effects, causing breast and prostate cancer. In the liver, BPA effects were of lesser intensity with decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit.In conclusion, short-term treatment with low doses of BPA slows down whole body energy metabolism and disrupts insulin signaling in peripheral tissues. At a specific dose level, BPA exposure also shows oxidative toxicity and carcinogenic effects. New research on very-low-dose exposure to BPA suggests an association with adverse health effects, including breast and prostate cancer, obesity, neurobehavioral problems, and reproductive abnormalities.

New vital tissues can be regenerated in permanent canine teeth after pulpectomy and enlargement of the apical foramen The loss of dental pulp may weaken teeth, rendering them susceptible to reinfection, fracture, and subsequent tooth loss. Therefore, regeneration of pulp is considered an ideal treatment to preserve teeth. Constitutive stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to excessive dentin and cementum formation Wnt/ß-catenin signaling plays an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation during development. Essential roles of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in tooth morphogenesis have been well known Our results indicate that persistent stabilization of ß-catenin in the dental mesenchyme leads to premature differentiation of odontoblasts and differentiation of cementoblasts, and induces excessive dentin and cementum formation in vivo.

51be03c4047fa84d1d000004	Describe the known functions for the prothymosin alpha c-terminal peptide?	The C-terminal decapeptide of prothymosin α is responsible for its stimulatory effect on the functions of human neutrophils in vitro In this study, we investigated the ability of the immunoreactive fragment of the polypeptide prothymosin alpha (proTα), i.e., the decapeptide proTα(100-109), to enhance the functions of neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients in comparison with those from healthy donors. Our results suggest that proTα(100-109) activates neutrophils, particularly those derived from breast cancer patients The Ca²(+)-dependent interaction between ProTα and S100A13 was found to require the C-terminal peptide sequences of both proteins. When cells were administered apoptogenic compounds, ProTα was cleaved by caspase-3 to generate a C-terminal peptide-deficient fragment, which lacks the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Prothymosin alpha immunoactive carboxyl-terminal peptide TKKQKTDEDD stimulates lymphocyte reactions, induces dendritic cell maturation Prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) is a small acidic polypeptide with important immunostimulatory properties, which we have previously shown to be exerted by its carboxyl (C)-terminus Here, we assayed the activity of synthetic peptides homologous to ProTalpha's C-terminus to stimulate lymphocyte functions, in particular natural killer cell cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors. A synthetic decapeptide TKKQKTDEDD was identified as the most potent lymphocyte stimulator. The activity of this peptide was sequence-specific and comparable to that of the intact molecule, suggesting that ProTalpha's immunoactive segment encompasses the nuclear localization signal sequence of the polypeptide. These data, in conjunction with reports showing that the peptide TKKQKTDEDD is generated in vivo upon caspase-cleavage of ProTalpha during apoptosis, strengthen our hypothesis that immune response stimulation by ProTalpha is in principle exerted via its bioactive C-terminal decapaptide, which can acquire a sequence-specific beta-sheet conformation and induce DC maturation. Ability to stimulate p53-dependent transcription was lost by C-terminal mutants of prothymosin alpha with impaired nuclear accumulation, but not by N-terminal deletion mutants and by the double mutant of prothymosin alpha with impaired ability to bind Keap1, suggesting that prothymosinalpha-Keap1 interaction is dispensable for p53 response. We found that zinc binding causes partial folding of the C-terminal half of ProTalpha, especially the Glu-rich region The immunologically active site of prothymosin alpha is located at the carboxy-terminus of the polypeptide. . ProTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) significantly fortified healthy donor-lymphocytes' immune responses to levels comparable to those induced by intact proTalpha. These effects were more pronounced in cancer patients, where peptides proTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) partly, however significantly, restored the depressed AMLR and cytolytic ability of PBMC, by simulating the biological activity exerted by intact proTalpha. This is the first report showing that proTalpha's immunomodulating activity can be substituted by its C-terminal peptide(s) The peptide (1-88) of calf prothymosin alpha is shown not to accumulate in the Xenopus nucleus, demonstrating that the C-terminal 21 residues, which include a KKQK sequence, are required for nuclear migration. fProt-alpha contains 28 aspartic and 25 glutamic acid residues and presents the typical basic KKQK amino acid sequence in the close carboxyl terminal region This is the first report showing that proTalpha's immunomodulating activity can be substituted by its C-terminal peptide(s).	['Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) (encoded in human by the PTMA gene) is a ubiquitous, highly acidic nuclear polypeptide. During early apoptosis, proTα is cleaved by activated caspase-3, with a primary attach site being D99, close to its carboxyl-terminus. The role of the cleaved decapeptide -- proTα(100-109) -- is not fully understood. proTα(100-109), which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) for ProTα, has been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory properties, such as to stimulate lymphocytes and neutrophils and induce dendritic cell maturation.']

The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium is a collaborative network of researchers working together on a range of large-scale studies that integrate data from 70 institutions worldwide. Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way. To overcome this problem, the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, an international neuroimaging consortium, established standard protocols for imaging analysis and employs either meta- and mega-analyses of psychiatric disorders with large sample sizes. To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. In the largest multi-site study to date, we examined WM anisotropy and diffusivity in 1305 MDD patients and 1602 healthy controls (age range 12-88 years) from 20 samples worldwide, which included both adults and adolescents, within the MDD Working Group of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium. Big data initiatives such as the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium (ENIGMA), combine data collected by independent studies worldwide to achieve more generalizable estimates of effect sizes and more reliable and reproducible outcomes.  The Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium is a global team science effort, now including over 800 scientists spread across 340 institutions in 35 countries, with the shared goal of understanding disease and genetic influences on the brain.

5e52af9e6d0a277941000048	What is GeneCodeq?	GeneCodeq: quality score compression and improved genotyping using a Bayesian framework. The exponential reduction in cost of genome sequencing has resulted in a rapid growth of genomic data. Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.RESULTS: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GeneCodeq is available at: github.com/genecodeq/eval GeneCodeq: quality score compression and improved genotyping using a Bayesian framework	['The exponential reduction in cost of genome sequencing has resulted in a rapid growth of genomic data.

5c52ca7c7e3cb0e23100000d	What is the link between ultraconserved elements and three-dimensional mammalian genome organization?	Ultraconserved Elements Occupy Specific Arenas of Three-Dimensional Mammalian Genome Organization. We find that UCEs are enriched within contact domains and, further, that the subset of UCEs within domains shared across diverse cell types are linked to kidney-related and neuronal processes. In boundaries, UCEs are generally depleted, with those that do overlap boundaries being overrepresented in exonic UCEs. Regarding loop anchors, UCEs are neither overrepresented nor underrepresented, but those present in loop anchors are enriched for splice sites. Finally, as the relationships between UCEs and human Hi-C features are conserved in mouse, our findings suggest that UCEs contribute to interspecies conservation of genome organization and, thus, genome stability.

5d3883a0a1e1595105000017	How is transcriptional elongation affected by nucleosome positioning?	Nucleosome arrays inhibit both initiation and elongation of transcripts  Both transcript initiation and elongation were inhibited, the extent of the inhibition being directly proportional to the number of nucleosome cores reconstituted onto the pT207-18 DNA templates. neither partial nor complete dissociation of the histone octamer is essential for transcription elongation through arrays of nucleosome cores in vitro. The high affinity of histones for single-stranded DNA observed in titration experiments performed using the purified (+) and (-) strands of the NX1 fragment suggests that nucleosome dissociation is not due to the formation of segments of single-stranded DNA by RNA polymerase in the elongation process These effects are especially pronounced on chromatin templates, where both transcription initiation and elongation are virtually halted. The inhibition of transcription elongation appears to result from a dramatic increase in premature termination of transcripts. By using this system, we show that BRG1, the enzymatic motor of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, is recruited to the positioned nucleosome in a transcription elongation-dependent manner and facilitates traversal of the nucleosome by RNAPII. in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin  We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.

58861f8b3b87a8a738000003	What is the purpose of the Orpington Prognostic Scale?	Stroke severity was determined using the Orpington Prognostic Scale. Predicting response to rehabilitation in elderly patients with stroke using the Orpington Prognostic Scale and selected clinical variables.  The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS) to predict outcome and response to subacute rehabilitation in older patients with stroke. The OPS scores were strong predictors of response to subacute rehabilitation and discharge FIM motor subscale scores. The OPS may warrant a broader application as a prognostic indicator for patients with stroke. PURPOSE: The aim of our study is to compare the Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and to evaluate whether they help us estimate the future functional status of patients with stroke. Comparison of the Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for the prediction of the functional status of patients with stroke. CONCLUSION: In patients with stroke, OPS and NIHSS had significant contribution to the estimation of the functional status and OPS was more effective than NIHSS. The Orpington Prognostic Score (OPS) is a clinically derived stroke severity scale that can be used to stratify patients into different severity groups. The OPS is a valid measure of stroke severity in Irish stroke in-patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high inter-rater and test-retest reliability, the OPS has limited predictive accuracy for discharge destination and is a poor predictor of follow-up services. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four patients with recent stroke admitted for inpatient rehabilitation were randomized within severity strata (Orpington Prognostic Scale) into 1 of 3 intervention groups. Predicting final disposition after stroke using the Orpington Prognostic Score. In Calgary, the Orpington Prognostic Score (OPS) has been used to predict outcome as an aid to rehabilitation triage.  CONCLUSIONS: The first week OPS can be used to predict final outcome. Predicting stroke recovery: three- and six-month rates of patient-centered functional outcomes based on the orpington prognostic scale. CONCLUSION: OPS scores can predict widely differing rates of functional recovery in five important functional abilities.  Prediction of functional outcome after stroke: comparison of the Orpington Prognostic Scale and the NIH Stroke Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in a sample of mostly mild and moderate strokes, the Orpington Prognostic Scale compared with the NIH Stroke Scale is simpler to use and is a slightly better predictor of ADL and higher levels of physical function. CONCLUSIONS: The Orpington score when assessed at 2-weeks post-stroke is a useful prognostic indicator with special suitability for the elderly and may help to select patients most likely to benefit from stroke unit rehabilitation. The OPS at 48 hours is a good predictor of outcome at 6 months and 2 years after ischemic stroke and allows early identification of 3 prognostic groups, which may help in identifying patients most likely to benefit from intensive rehabilitation.

We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We discovered classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or tended to overlap with nucleosomes.

We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis.  When TFs are bound to active regulatory regions, they displace canonical nucleosomes, making these regions biochemically detectable as nucleosome-depleted regions or accessible/open chromatin. Here we ask whether open chromatin profiling can be used to identify the entire repertoire of active promoters and enhancers underlying tissue-specific gene expression during normal development and oncogenesis in vivo. To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin.

5c66d3977c78d69471000017	What is PEGylation?	ttachment of a chain of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to a therapeutic protein, a process widely known as PEGylation, can lead to several beneficial effects. It has the potential to significantly delay aggregation of the protein by steric shielding, a frequently encountered issue in the development of protein drugs. Moreover, it can modify the pharmacokinetic profile of the PEGylated protein by delaying renal excretion, leading to a longer half-life (t1/2) of the drug. By steric hindrance, it can also inhibit interactions between the protein drug and proteases as well as the host immune system, thereby inhibiting inactivation of the PEGylated protein and also attenuating its immunogenicity.

By steric hindrance, it can also inhibit interactions between the protein drug and proteases as well as the host immune system, thereby inhibiting inactivation of the PEGylated protein and also attenuating its immunogenicity.']

(CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene.  CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1-2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms. More recently, a new system for genome engineering based on the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), was shown to have the potential to also regulate gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in a more specific way.

RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) for sequence-specific control of gene expression We show that delivery of the CRISPRi system is successful and can specifically repress a reporter gene in recipient cells, thereby establishing a new tool for gene regulation across bacterial cells and potentially for bacterial population control. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible.

532f03e6d6d3ac6a34000022	what is the role of GATA-4 in regeneration of the heart after myocardial infarction?	TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration. G-CSF treatment also led to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and induction of GATA-4 and various sarcomeric proteins such as myosin heavy chain, troponin I and desmin.  We describe here the identification of a subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, processing stem cell marker, c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, and cardiac specific proteins, troponin-I, alpha-sarcomeric actinin and connexin-43. They exhibited a high in vitro proliferative potential. These findings strongly suggest that these cells are putative cardiomyocyte precursors. After transplantation, they were able to be retained and proliferate (13.63 +/- 5.97% after 2 weeks) within the ischemic heart. Progeny of implanted cells migrated along the infarcted scar, reconstituted regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibited cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation.  Histological studies at week 12 post-transplantation demonstrated engraftment of the pre DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardium and their expression of human specific alpha-cardiac actin. Human alpha cardiac actin-positive cells also expressed cardiac nuclear factors; nkx2.5 and GATA-4. Our results suggest that intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for future cardiac tissue regeneration. This pattern of colocalization was also found in developing embryonic myocardium. Cardiac transcription factors Nkx-2.5 and GATA-4 were strongly expressed in the muscle bundles.  After hypergravity and 5-Aza treatment, BMSCs showed positive for the early muscle and cardiac markers GATA-4, MEF-2, and Nkx2-5 with RT-PCR Experiments in murine models of myocardial infarction (MI) demonstrated population of VSELs expressed also early markers of cardiac and endothelial lineages (GATA-4, Nkx2.5/Csx, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor) which migrated to stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and other chemoattractant gradient and underwent rapid mobilization into peripheral blood in experimental MI mice models. We conclude that GATA-4 overexpression in MSCs increased both MSC survival and angiogenic potential in ischemic myocardium and may therefore represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for postinfarct remodeling. These cardiac c-kit+AT2+ cells, represented approximately 0.19% of total cardiac cells in infarcted heart, were characterized by upregulated transcription factors implicated in cardiogenic differentiation (Gata-4, Notch-2, Nkx-2.5) and genes required for self-renewal (Tbx-3, c-Myc, Akt).  these findings suggest G-CSF administration could be an effective approach to treating chronic heart failure following a large MI.

These morphological findings suggested that autoreactive T-cell clones were responsible for thyrocyte destruction and hypothyroidism through effector-target cytotoxic recognition. Later, autonomous interaction between thyrocyte Fas and FasL has been proposed as a major mechanism of thyrocyte depletion in Hashimoto's thyroiditis Here, we analyze the possible role of Fas and FasL in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We suggest that the Fas-FasL system dictates the outcome of the autoimmune response by acting on both immune and target cells After autoimmune inflammation, interactions between CD95 and its ligand (CD95L) mediate thyrocyte destruction in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) modulation of apoptosis-related proteins by TH1 and TH2 cytokines controls thyrocyte survival in thyroid autoimmunity Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting from Fas-mediated thyrocyte destruction Although autocrine/paracrine Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interaction is responsible for thyrocyte cell death during the active phases of HT, the role of infiltrating T lymphocytes (ITL) in this process is still unknown All ITL expressed high levels of Fas and CD69, an early marker of T cell activation associated with functional Fas expression in T cells in vivo. In contrast to thyrocytes that were found to produce high levels of FasL, ITL did not express significant amounts of FasL, suggesting that ITL are not directly involved in thyrocyte destruction These data demonstrate that ITL are not directly involved in thyrocyte cell death during HT, suggesting that autocrine/paracrine Fas-FasL interaction is a major mechanism in autoimmune thyrocyte destruction Thyrocytes from HT glands, but not from nonautoimmune thyroids, expressed Fas. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), abundantly produced in HT glands, induced Fas expression in normal thyrocytes, and cross-linking of Fas resulted in massive thyrocyte apoptosis. The ligand for Fas (FasL) was shown to be constitutively expressed both in normal and HT thyrocytes and was able to kill Fas-sensitive targets. Exposure to IL-1beta induced thyrocyte apoptosis, which was prevented by antibodies that block Fas, suggesting that IL-1beta-induced Fas expression serves as a limiting factor for thyrocyte destruction. Thus, Fas-FasL interactions among HT thyrocytes may contribute to clinical hypothyroidism MECHANISM OF APOPTOSIS IN HASHIMOTO THYROIDITIS: The thyroid cell destruction characteristic of autoimmune thyroiditis can be seen as the consequence of inappropriate expression of Fas or TRAIL death pathway molecules and down-regulation of the apoptosis controlling protein Bcl-2, which may be induced by cytokines released locally by infiltrating lymphocytes.

INTRODUCTION: An Amyand's hernia is a heterogeneous clinical condition defined by the presence of the vermiform appendix within an inguinal hernia sac, which may or may not contain other abdominal contents or pathologic inflammatory changes. INTRODUCTION: An Amyand hernia is a rare disease where the appendix is found within an inguinal hernia sac.  CONCLUSION: This case report reviews a rare entity known as an Amyand's hernia that presented as an incarcerated hernia that was diagnosed intraoperatively with an inflamed appendix, recognized as a type 2 Amyand's hernia. Claudius Amyand's hernia is defined as the incarceration of the vermiform appendix in the hernia sac. Amyand's hernia is an inguinal hernia; a protrusion of abdominal cavity content through the inguinal canal, with a vermiform appendix.

5e339202fbd6abf43b000062	What is the risk for secondary cancer after proton beam therapy?	In pediatric patients who had undergone PBT, the LAR of PBT was significantly lower than the LAR of IMXT estimated by in silico modeling.  Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a potential new alternative to treatment with photon radiotherapy that may reduce the risk of late toxicity and secondary cancer, especially for pediatric tumors. No malignant secondary tumors occurred within the irradiated field. The 10- and 20-year cumulative rates for all secondary tumors, malignant secondary tumors, and malignant nonhematologic secondary tumors were 8% and 16%, 5% and 13%, and 3% and 11%, respectively. Our data indicate that PBT has the potential to reduce the risk of late mortality and secondary malignancy. However, treatment-related toxicities have also occurred, particularly for radiotherapy, after which secondary cancer, reduced function of irradiated organs, and retarded growth are significant problems. Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a particle radiotherapy with excellent dose localization that permits treatment of liver and lung cancer by administration of a high dose to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues.  Notably, proton beam therapy is very useful for pediatric cancer; since the pediatric radiation dose to normal tissues should be reduced as much as possible because of the effect of radiation on growth, intellectual development, endocrine organ function and secondary cancer development.  After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average).  However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation.  Proton beam therapy (PT) offers improved sparing of normal tissue, thus potentially reducing the risk for treatment related late sequelae and induction of secondary cancer.  INTRODUCTION: The concern of secondary cancer induction and normal tissue complications have motivated a more frequent use of protons in radiotherapy (RT) of children.  However, activation, neutron production, and the associated secondary cancer risk in proton beam should be an important consideration which is evaluated. RESULTS: In all evaluated organs, the mean dose in PBT was 20-80% of that in CRT. The risk of secondary cancer in PBT was 24-83% of that in CRT for five organs, but 121% of that in CRT for pancreas.  Assessments of secondary cancer risk showed that PBT reduces the risk of secondary cancer in most organs, whereas IMRT is associated with a higher risk than CRT. A recent study suggested reduced secondary cancer and other late toxicities after proton beam therapy (PBT) due to dosimetric advantages. After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average). The incidence of secondary malignancies after proton beam therapy is low but not negligible, therefore, it must be taken into account when planning a treatment as secondary tumors may present with a highly aggressive behaviour. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen. Purpose: Proton radiotherapy (PRT) is potentially associated with a lower risk for secondary malignancies due to a decreased integral dose to the surrounding organs at risk (OARs). Our data indicate that PBT has the potential to reduce the risk of late mortality and secondary malignancy. The total lifetime risk of second cancer due exclusively to stray radiation was 1.5% for the passively scattered treatment versus 0.8% for the scanned proton beam treatment. In general, the risk for developing a second malignancy in out-of-field organs for PBS remains much lower compared to PPT even if apertures are being applied. CONCLUSIONS: PBS PT is associated to significant SCR reduction in BC patients compared to photon radiotherapy.  Calculations of out-of-field organ doses following a brain tumor treatment indicated that proton PBS therapy of brain tumors is associated with a low risk of radiation-induced cancer. CONCLUSIONS: When considering exposure to primary and secondary radiation, proton therapy can reduce the risk of an SMN in prostate patients compared with contemporary IMRT. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the risks of radiation-induced secondary cancers after radiosurgery of liver metastases may be reduced, if IMPT is used instead of photon-beam based SBRT. Clinical data are emerging supporting the lower incidence of secondary malignancies after PRT compared with historical photon data, though longer follow-up in proton treated cohorts is awaited. However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment.	['Proton beam therapy is associated with lower risk of secondary cancer when compared to other radiation therapy approaches. It allows excellent dose localization by administration of a high dose to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues. Therefore it is more commonly used in children.']

An operon is a group of genes linked together in a linear fashion and producing a polycistronic mRNA. Trans-acting factors regulate the transcription of these genes by interacting with promoter/regulatory sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the most 5'-ward of the genes.  The regulation of gene expression was studied, for the Escherichia coli rpoBC operon, which includes the genes, rpoB and rpoC, for the beta and beta subunits of RNA polymerase, and rplJ and rplL, The lux operon is an uncommon gene cluster. An analysis of operon gene expression from nine different EST libraries indicated that for 587 operons, all of the genes that comprise an individual operon were expressed together in at least one EST library, suggesting that these genes may be co-regulated. A post-transcriptional operon is a set of monocistronic mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins that are co-regulated by a group of RNA-binding proteins and/or small non-coding RNAs so that protein expression is coordinated at the post-transcriptional level. T An operon is a set of neighboring genes in a genome that is transcribed as a single polycistronic message. The operon is a specific functional organization of genes found in bacterial genomes. UNLABELLED: Operons are multigene transcriptional units which occur mostly in prokaryotes but rarely in Operons are clusters of genes that are transcribed as a single message, and regulated by the same gene expression machinery. Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. Operons are clusters of genes that are co-regulated from a common promoter. Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis. The organization of genes into operons, clusters of genes that are co-transcribed to produce polycistronic pre-mRNAs, is a trait found in a wide range of eukaryotic groups, including multiple animal phyla. Operons are clusters of unrelated genes with related functions that are a feature of prokaryotic genomes.

5c5f39011a4c55d80b000027	What is Burning Mouth Syndrome(BMS)?	Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain syndrome that primarily affects peri- and postmenopausal women. It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia. Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily… more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions" (IHS 2013). Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic orofacial pain disorder that is defined by a burning sensation in the oral mucosa. Burning mouth syndrome.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings.  Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning, painful sensation of the oral mucosa that most commonly involves the anterior tongue. Burning mouth syndrome is a complicated, poorly understood, predominantly oral condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States. Burning mouth syndrome is a common disorder, usually affecting elderly females, characterised by intractable pain and burning in the oral cavity, evident especially in the tongue, together with a normal mouth mucosa. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity. Burning mouth syndrome is an idiopathic pain disorder, which appears to be neuropathic in origin. Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a predominantly oral condition characterized by the occurrence of a chronic burning that commonly involves the anterior tongue, painful sensation, dryness and taste alterations. The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation of burning in the oral cavity, without clinical signs. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a burning sensation or stinging disorder affecting the oral mucosa in the absence of any clinical signs or mucosal lesions. Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic pain condition characterized by burning, painful sensations within the oral cavity. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is common conditions that affects menopause women, patients suffer from sever burning sensation. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane often associated with symptoms such as subjective dryness of the mouth, paraesthesia and altered taste for which no medical or dental cause can be found. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an intense burning or stinging sensation, preferably on the tongue or in other areas of mouth. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain or burning sensation affecting the oral mucosa, often unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other evident clinical signs. Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, which is used only after nutritional deficiencies, mucosal disease, fungal infections, hormonal disturbances and contact stomatitis have been ruled out. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disease characterized by burning of the oral mucosa associated with a sensation of dry mouth and/or taste alterations. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning sensations of the oral cavity in the absence of abnormalities of the oral mucosa. Burning mouth syndrome generally presents as a triad: Mouth pain, alteration in taste, and altered salivation, in the absence of visible mucosal lesions in the mouth. We analyzed the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome and of the burning oral sensation and currently, we could not find a consensus on the diagnosis and classification of BMS. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is multifactorial in origin which is typically characterized by burning and painful sensation in an oral cavity demonstrating clinically normal mucosa. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, burning mouth Syndrome (BMS) is defined as a burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane in the absence of clinical signs or laboratory findings. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by the presence of burning sensation of the oral mucosa in the absence of clinically apparent mucosal alterations. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) refers to a chronic orofacial pain disorder usually unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other clinical signs of organic disease. Burning mouth syndrome may present as an idiopathic condition (primary BMS type) distinct from the symptom of oral burning that can potentially arise from various local or systemic abnormalities (secondary BMS type), including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal changes associated with menopause, local oral infections, denture-related lesions, xerostomia, hypersensitivity reactions, medications, and systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus.	['Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), a chronic intraoral burning sensation or dysesthesia without clinically evident causes, is one of the most common medically unexplained oral symptoms/syndromes. It predominately affects middle-aged women in the postmenopausal period. The condition is distinguished by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa and the absence of any clinical signs.', 'Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain syndrome that primarily affects peri- and postmenopausal women. It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia.']
5a722d9f2dc08e987e000004	What is mechanism of action of Benralizumab?	Since IL-5 plays an important role in the maturation, survival and migration of eosinophils, hence the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma, biotherapeutics targeting IL-5/IL-5Rα have been developed and/or marketed, including Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, and Benralizumab. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab target IL-5, a key cytokine for eosinophils. Benralizumab is a humanized, afucosylated, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α, immunoglobulin G (IgG)1κ monoclonal antibody. A global meta-analysis was first conducted followed by an indirect comparison of each IL-5-targeting drug: benralizumab, reslizumab and mepolizumab.  These include monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 or IL-5 receptor alpha (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab), IL-13 (lebrikizumab and tralokinumab), IL-4 receptor alpha (dupilumab), IgE (omalizumab), and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tezepelumab) and small molecule therapies such as prostaglandin D2blockers (fevipiprant and timapiprant). However, there is research underway investigating interleukin-based monoclonal antibodies such as benralizumab, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody which is currently in phase III clinical development.  BACKGROUND: Benralizumab is a humanised, anti-interleukin 5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that directly and rapidly depletes eosinophils, reduces asthma exacerbations, and improves lung function for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.  . We investigated whether benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor that significantly reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations, was also effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in patients relying on oral glucocorticoids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia. Benralizumab--a humanized mAb to IL-5Rα with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity--a novel approach for the treatment of asthma. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the α subunit of the receptor to IL-5. We assessed the safety and efficacy of benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5 receptor α that depletes eosinophils by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma with eosinophilia. While previous monoclonal antibodies against the IL-5 ligand resulted in inconsistent improvements in asthma outcomes, benralizumab has shown promise. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 receptor, and has an enhanced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function. Anti-IL-5-based therapies (mepolizumab and reslizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that recognize free IL-5, benralizumab is a hmAb directed at the α subunit of the IL-5R) target the IL-5-signaling in eosinophilic asthma. Benralizumab is a humanised, afucosylated, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that induces direct, rapid, and nearly complete depletion of eosinophils. Benralizumab is a humanized anti-IL5 receptor α (IL5Rα) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with enhanced (afucosylation) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function. BACKGROUND: Benralizumab is a humanised, afucosylated, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that induces direct, rapid, and nearly complete depletion of eosinophils. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5 receptor α to deplete blood eosinophils and improve the clinical outcomes of allergic asthma. Expert opinion: Benralizumab has the advantage over other anti-IL-5 therapies to target the IL-5Rα itself. Benralizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that depletes blood and airway eosinophils. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5 receptor α to deplete blood eosinophils and improve the clinical outcomes of allergic asthma.

BACKGROUND Benralizumab is an anti-eosinophilic, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that has been shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. As IL-5 is implicated in disease states that are mediated by eosinophils, benralizumab is an attractive option for use in the management of asthma. INTRODUCTION Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the α subunit of the receptor to IL-5. Benralizumab is a humanized, afucosylated, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α, immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 κ monoclonal antibody. We investigated whether benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor that significantly reduces the incidence of asthma exacerbations, was also effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in patients relying on oral glucocorticoids to manage severe asthma associated with eosinophilia. In a phase 2b dose-ranging study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of benralizumab, an anti-interleukin 5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that depletes blood and airway eosinophils, in adults with uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma. Benralizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody, depletes blood and sputum eosinophils.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000006	What is the association between moon cycle and rupture risk  of intracranial aneurysms?	Recently, it has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), however, another author found no such association.  We found no correlation between incidence of aneurysmal SAH, location of the aneurysm, initial clinical presentation, or amount of subarachnoid blood and the lunar cycle.  The moon influences neither the incidence of aneurysmal SAH nor the grade of initial neurological deterioration or amount of subarachnoid blood. We did not observe any significant impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in 717 consecutive patients (p=0.84). The impact of the lunar cycle on aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is a myth rather than reality. An incidence peak for aneurysm rupture (28 patients) was seen during the phase of new moon, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The lunar cycle seems to affect the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, with the new moon being associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal SAH.

56ccccf55795f9a73e000037	What is the role of NETs in systemic lupus erythematosus?	Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent an important defense mechanism against microorganisms. Clearance of NETs is impaired in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and NETosis is increased in neutrophils and, particularly, in low-density granulocytes derived from lupus patients. NETs are toxic to the endothelium, expose immunostimulatory molecules, activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and may participate in organ damage through incompletely characterized pathways. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released via a novel form of cell death called NETosis. NETs, consisting of a chromatin meshwork decorated with antimicrobial peptides, play an important role in the innate response to microbial infections. Some lupus patients do not clear NETs normally, a phenotype that correlates with disease activity. Further, lupus neutrophils - and, in particular, an aberrant subset called low-density granulocytes - have an increased propensity to undergo NETosis.  NETs can also directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis.  Antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of secreted chromatin that may act as a source of autoantigens typical for SLE. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE), since netting neutrophils release potentially immunogenic autoantigens including histones, LL37, human neutrophil peptide (HNP), and self-DNA Elevated Plasma cfDNA May be Associated with Active Lupus Nephritis and Partially Attributed to Abnormal Regulation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus The ability to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is reduced in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) A decreased ability to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is seen in a subgroup of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and correlates with the presence of autoantibodies Recent studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of NETs could be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus Both exuberant NETosis and impaired clearance of NETs have been implicated in the organ damage of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), small vessel vasculitis (SVV), and psoriasis Netting neutrophils induce endothelial damage, infiltrate tissues, and expose immunostimulatory molecules in systemic lupus erythematosus. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is increased in SLE and has been proposed to contribute to endothelial damage, but the mechanism remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which enhanced NET formation by low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in SLE contributes to endothelial damage and disrupts the endothelium.RESULTS: The putative role of NET-externalised matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in altering the functional integrity of the endothelium was examined.  In this study, we investigated how complement interacts with NETs and how NET degradation is affected by complement in SLE patients.  NETs are a potent stimulus for IFNα release by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and, as such, may play an important role in propagation of the lupus phenotype. NETs can also directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis. Active NOS, NOX, and MPO within NETs significantly modify HDL, rendering the lipoprotein proatherogenic. Since NET formation is enhanced in SLE, these findings support a novel role for NET-derived lipoprotein oxidation in SLE-associated CVD and identify additional proatherogenic roles of neutrophils and putative protective roles of antimalarials in autoimmunity.

5c6ffde47c78d69471000059	What is CIBERSORT used for?	We recently described CIBERSORT, a versatile computational method for quantifying cell fractions from bulk tissue gene expression profiles (GEPs).  We introduce CIBERSORT, a method for characterizing cell composition of complex tissues from their gene expression profiles.  By applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival.  We applied an established computational approach (CIBERSORT) to bulk gene expression profiles of almost 11,000 tumours to infer the proportions of 22 subsets of immune cells. We investigated associations between each cell type and survival and response to chemotherapy, modelling cellular proportions as quartiles.  Finally, we characterised the overall abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells in breast cancers from TCGA and METABRIC using ESTIMATE and relative frequency of 22 immune cell subsets in breast cancers from METABRIC using CIBERSORT In this chapter, we provide a primer on the CIBERSORT method and illustrate its use for characterizing TILs in tumor samples profiled by microarray or RNA-Seq. We recently described CIBERSORT, a versatile computational method for quantifying cell fractions from bulk tissue gene expression profiles (GEPs). Combining support vector regression with prior knowledge of expression profiles from purified leukocyte subsets, CIBERSORT can accurately estimate the immune composition of a tumor biopsy. The main limitations of this study are the use of diverse platforms for measuring gene expression, including some not previously used with CIBERSORT, and the combined analysis of different forms of follow-up across studies. In this study, based on a deconvolution algorithm (known as CIBERSORT) and clinical annotated expression profiles, we comprehensively analyzed the tumor-infiltrating immune cells present in CRC for the first time. In this study, based on a metagene approach (known as CIBERSORT) and an online databse, The Cancer Immunome Atlas (https://tcia.at/), we comprehensively analyzed the tumor-infiltrating immune cells present in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. CYT was defined by GZMA and PRF1 expression, and CIBERSORT was used to evaluate intratumoral immune cell composition. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the fraction of 22 immune cell types to study their relations with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). By applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival. The recently developed CIBERSORT method allows immune cell profiling by deconvolution of gene expression microarray data. Our data demonstrate that deconvolution of gene expression data by CIBERSORT provides valuable information about immune cell composition of HCC patients. CIBERSORT was used to resolve 22 immune cell types from the tumor transcriptomes. We used Cibersort to deconvolute immune cell components based on PBMCs or whole blood IPF genomics datasets. Novel algorithms allowing the deconvolution of bulk tumor transcriptomes to find the relative proportions of infiltrating leucocytes, such as CIBERSORT, should be appropriate for this aim but in practice they fail to accurately recognize γδ T lymphocytes. CIBERSORT should enable large-scale analysis of RNA mixtures for cellular biomarkers and therapeutic targets (http://cibersort.stanford.edu/). We introduce CIBERSORT, a method for characterizing cell composition of complex tissues from their gene expression profiles. Additionally, CIBERSORT in silico deconvolution was used to determine fractions of immune cell sub-populations within the gene expression datasets. We analyzed IL-34 mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patients and applied established computational approaches (CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, TIMER, TCIA), to analyze gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  When applied to enumeration of hematopoietic subsets in RNA mixtures from fresh, frozen and fixed tissues, including solid tumors, CIBERSORT outperformed other methods with respect to noise, unknown mixture content and closely related cell types. In this chapter, we provide a primer on the CIBERSORT method and illustrate its use for characterizing TILs in tumor samples profiled by microarray or RNA-Seq.<br> By applying CIBERSORT, we assessed the relative proportions of immune cells in 41 healthy human livers, 305 HCC samples and 82 HCC adjacent tissues.

5a37df1c966455904c000004	How does Dst1 knock-out affect transcription in yeast?	While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability. Genetic interactions of DST1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest a role of TFIIS in the initiation-elongation transition. We showed that: (1) dst1 and rpb9 mutants have a synthetic growth defective phenotype when combined with fyv4, gim5, htz1, yal011w, ybr231c, soh1, vps71, and vps72 mutants that is exacerbated during germination or at high salt concentrations;  Yet we find strong genetic interaction of rpb4∆ with mutants in many transcription elongation factors such as Paf1, Spt4, Dst1, Elp3 and Rpb9. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in tRNA synthesis and showed a reduced Pol III occupancy at the restrictive temperature.  Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TFIIS can bind the Cdk8 module and SAGA in cell-free extracts. spt8Delta and dst1Delta mutants were sensitive to nucleotide-depleting drugs and epistatic to null mutants of the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb9, suggesting that their elongation defects are mediated by Rpb9. rpb9Delta, spt8Delta and dst1Delta were lethal in cells lacking the Rpb4 subunit.  Ess1 opposes elongation factors Dst1 and Spt4/5, and overexpression of ESS1 makes cells more sensitive to the elongation inhibitor 6-AU. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s). We additionally show that Dst1, a homolog of mammalian transcription elongation factor TFIIS, interferes with NER-dependent repair of AP lesions while suppressing homologous recombination pathway. Overall, Def1 and Dst1 mediate very different outcomes in response to AP-induced transcription arrest. Yet we find strong genetic interaction of rpb4∆ with mutants in many transcription elongation factors such as Paf1, Spt4, Dst1, Elp3 and Rpb9. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s).. However, deletion of DST1, the gene encoding the yeast homolog of TFIIS, had only a small effect on transcriptional fidelity, as determined by this assay. Deletions of three yeast genes, SET2, CDC73, and DST1, involved in transcriptional elongation and/or chromatin metabolism were used in conjunction with genetic array technology to screen approximately 4700 yeast deletions and identify double deletion mutants that produce synthetic growth defects.	['While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability. We showed that:  dst1 and rpb9 mutants have a synthetic growth defective phenotype when combined with fyv4, gim5, htz1, yal011w, ybr231c, soh1, vps71, and vps72 mutants that is exacerbated during germination or at high salt concentrations. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in tRNA synthesis and showed a reduced Pol III occupancy at the restrictive temperature.', 'While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability.']
5e48b7e2d14c9f295d000014	What is the use of erenumab?	Phase I, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single-dose, and Multiple-dose Studies of Erenumab in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Migraine. Erenumab was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile, supporting further clinical development of erenumab for migraine prevention. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention.  Conclusions As a preventive treatment of episodic migraine, erenumab at a dosage of 70 mg monthly significantly reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication use.  CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.  Estimating the clinical effectiveness and value-based price range of erenumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with prior treatment failures: a US societal perspective. CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).

5518e7a7622b194345000002	What is the function of the enzymes known as dual specificity phoshpatases (DUSPs)?	MAPK activity is negatively regulated by members of the dual specificity phosphatase (Dusp) family, which differ in expression, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues on target MAPKs.  The dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a heterogeneous group of cysteine-based protein tyrosine phosphatases, whose members exert a pivotal role in cell physiology by dephosphorylation of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine residues from proteins, as well as other non-proteinaceous substrates.  Several dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that play key roles in the direct or indirect inactivation of different MAP kinases (MAPKs) have been implicated in human cancers over the past decade. Dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) provide a complex negative regulatory network that acts to shape the duration, magnitude and spatiotemporal profile of MAP kinase activities in response to both physiological and pathological stimuli Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) is an emerging subclass of the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily, a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate. Recently, a series of investigations of DUSPs defined their essential roles in cell proliferation, cancer and the immune response.  Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) fulfill essential biological functions and are key pharmaceutical targets. Regulation of MAPKs is achieved via a plethora of regulatory proteins including activating MAPKKs and an abundance of deactivating phosphatases The protein tyrosine phosphatase family (PTP) contains a group of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that regulate the activivity of MAP kinases (MAPKs), which are key effectors in the control of cell growth and survival in physiological and pathological processes, including cancer.  Dual-specificity protein phosphatases participate in signal transduction pathways inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). These signaling pathways are of critical importance in the regulation of numerous biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and development. Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) dephosphorylates and, hence, regulates the activity of MAP kinases. Dual-Specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs) are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from both phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine/threonine residues. A subgroup of DUSPs specifically targets Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) and has been shown to participate in the regulation of differential cellular responses to the large variety of stimuli conveyed by MAPK-pathways.  DUSPs (dual-specificity phosphatases) are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate. DUSPs have been implicated as major modulators of critical signalling pathways that are dysregulated in various diseases. DUSPs can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, PRLs (phosphatases of regenerating liver), Cdc14 phosphatases (Cdc is cell division cycle), PTENs (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, MKPs (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical DUSPs. The dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a heterogeneous group of cysteine-based protein tyrosine phosphatases, whose members exert a pivotal role in cell physiology by dephosphorylation of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine residues from proteins, as well as other non-proteinaceous substrates. Dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs), which dephosphorylate both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine, play vital roles in immune activation, brain function and cell-growth signalling.

54ede34694afd61504000004	Which is the genetic cause for the development of Fanconi anemia complementation group D1?	The discovery of biallelic BRCA2 mutations in the FA-D1 complementation group allows for the first time to study the characteristics of primary BRCA2-deficient human cells. Although he lacked a strong family history of cancer, he was subsequently shown to carry biallelic mutations in the FANCD1/BRCA2 gene. These included an IVS7 splice-site mutation, which is strongly associated with early AML in homozygous or compound heterozygous carrier status in FA-D1 patients. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause FA-D1.  The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 was recently found to be associated with Fanconi anemia complementation group D1 (FA-D1) One kindred, of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, had five members who were diagnosed with breast cancer and two cousins who were BRCA2*6174delT/C3069X compound heterozygotes and had Fanconi anemia and brain tumors In another kindred of Ashkenazi Jewish and Lithuanian Catholic ancestry, a child with Fanconi anemia and a medulloblastoma was a BRCA2*6174delT/886delGT compound heterozygote Two other kindreds each contained a Fanconi anemia-afflicted child who developed medulloblastoma; one child was of Latin American ancestry and a compound heterozygote for BRCA2*I2490T/ 5301insA and the other was African American and a compound heterozygote for BRCA2*Q3066X/E1308X Surprisingly, biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 breast-cancer-susceptibility gene were found in Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare hereditary disorder characterized by chromosomal instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, and cancer susceptibility  The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 was recently found to be associated with Fanconi anemia complementation group D1 (FA-D1).

56c1f011ef6e394741000042	What is the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab for treatment of multiple sclerosis?	Recent therapeutic advances include modifications to improve tolerability of existing products (e.g. interferon beta and glatiramer acetate), development of novel anti-neuroinflammatory medications (e.g. fingolimod, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate, daclizumab, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab) and investigation of treatments in progressive MS (e.g. natalizumab, mastinib, natalizumab, siponimod). This review provides insights into clinical studies with the mAbs natalizumab, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. Alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab and daclizumab respresent monoclonal antibodies in advanced stages of clinical development for their use in RRMS patients. Attempts to study the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab and B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibodies, i.e. rituximab, ocrelizumab or ofatumumab, in CIDP patients are currently under way.  More recently, monoclonal antibodies have been engineered to act through specific mechanisms such as blocking alpha-4 integrin interactions (natalizumab) or lysing cells bearing specific markers, for example CD52 (alemtuzumab) or CD20 (ocrelizumab and ofatumumab).  In multiple sclerosis (MS), B cell-depleting therapy using monoclonal anti-CD20 Abs, including rituximab (RTX) and ocrelizumab, effectively reduces disease activity.  Today, there is broad experience with natalizumab and other MOAB (alemtuzumab, daclizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and anti-lingo-1) that are pending commercialization or are under phase II or III of development with promising results.   To reduce the risk of infusion reactions and improve long-term tolerability, the human-derived components of the antibody have been increased to form humanized or human monoclonal antibodies like ocrelizumab and ofatumumab. Ocrelizumab will likely also be licensed as a second-line therapy in highly active MS.  This is because of: (i) patent expirations, (ii) the introduction of natalizumab, which targets the interaction between leukocytes and the blood-CNS barrier, (iii) the launch of three oral immunomodulatory drugs (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide), with another (laquinimod) under regulatory review and (iv) a number of immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab, daclizumab and ocrelizumab) about to enter the market.  In this review, we further discuss evidence for B cell and Ig contribution to human MS and NMO pathogenesis, pro-inflammatory and regulatory B cell effector functions, impaired B cell immune tolerance, the B cell-fostering microenvironment in the CNS, and B cell-targeted therapeutic interventions for MS and NMO, including CD20 depletion (rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab), anti-IL6-R (tocilizumab), complement-blocking (eculizumab), inhibitors of AQP4-Ig binding (aquaporumab, small molecular compounds), and BAFF/BAFF-R-targeting agents. The main efficacy and safety results of these drugs are reviewed in this paper. They can be classified into 2 groups: oral (fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, BG-12 [dimethyl fumarate], oral cladribine, dalfampridine) and monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab). Daclizumab and ocrelizumab are monoclonal antibodies that have shown efficacy and acceptable safety profiles in phase 2 trials; both are under investigation in ongoing phase 3 trials.  As such, humoral targeted immunotherapies that are being developed for MS are discussed herein: rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab show promise as B-cell depleting agents.   The section on anti-CD20 antibodies reviews Phase II results on ocrelizumab and ofatumumab, and discusses current perspectives of these antibodies for MS therapy. Rituximab is unlikely to be developed further as its license will expire, but ocrelizumab, another monoclonal antibody directly targeting B cells, is currently in phase 2 development and looks promising. In addition, oral laquinimod, several monoclonal antibodies (eg, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab), and other agents have shown preliminary beneficial results in relapsing MS in phase 3 clinical trials.  They can be categorized according to their mode of action into compounds targeting (i) leukocyte migration into the CNS (natalizumab); (ii) cytolytic antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab); or (iii) antibodies and recombinant proteins targeting cytokines and chemokines and their receptors (daclizumab, ustekinumab, atacicept, tabalumab [Ly-2127399], secukinumab [AIN457]).  The second concept is to deplete T cells and/or B cells from the peripheral circulation using highly specific monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) or rituximab/ocrelizumab (anti-CD20).  More recently, monoclonal antibodies have been engineered to act through specific mechanisms such as blocking alpha-4 integrin interactions (natalizumab) or lysing cells bearing specific markers, for example CD52 (alemtuzumab) or CD20 (ocrelizumab and ofatumumab). Biogen Idec Inc, Genentech Inc, Roche Holding AG and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd are developing ocrelizumab, a humanized mAb against CD20, for the potential treatment of inflammatory disorders and B-cell malignancies.

58ea6c3eeda5a57672000001	What is magnetoreception?	The ability to perceive geomagnetic fields (GMFs) represents a fascinating biological phenomenon. Studies on transgenic flies have provided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved in the response to magnetic fields (MFs).  Cryptochromes, blue-light absorbing proteins involved in the circadian clock, have been proposed to be the receptor molecules of the avian magnetic compass.  Although it has been known for almost half a century that migratory birds can detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, the primary sensory mechanism behind this remarkable feat is still unclear. The leading hypothesis centers on radical pairs-magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates formed by photoexcitation of cryptochrome proteins in the retina.  Biogenic magnetic particles have been detected in some migratory insects, which implies the basis of magnetoreception mechanism for orientation and navigation.  Magnetoreception is essential for magnetic orientation in animal migration. The molecular basis for magnetoreception has recently been elucidated in fruitfly as complexes between the magnetic receptor magnetoreceptor (MagR) and its ligand cryptochrome (Cry). MagR and Cry are present in the animal kingdom. Magnetoreception is an enigmatic, poorly understood sensory ability, described mainly on the basis of behavioural studies in animals of diverse taxa.  The photoreceptor protein cryptochrome is thought to host, upon light absorption, a radical pair that is sensitive to very weak magnetic fields, endowing migratory birds with a magnetic compass sense.

Disease activity of SLE was evaluated according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score. SLE patients were examined to evaluate their clinical status and disease activity. A complete Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score was obtained for each patient. The course and prognostic value of disease activity measured by the validated Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) was investigated in 68 newly diagnosed black Caribbean cases. The objective of this study is to determine if digital vasculitis (DV), a clinical manifestation with a high systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) score, is associated with lupus severity. OBJECTIVE To determine whether Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores correlate with the clinician's impression of level of disease activity. Sociodemographic, disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), therapy and laboratory variables were evaluated.

55414e4f472cfd8617000002	What is known about MER41 repeat sequences?	We report eleven new families of MEdium Reiteration frequency (MER) interspersed repeats in the genomes of Primates, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha. Two families of the human repeats, MER 46 and MER 47, represent non-autonomous DNA transposons. These sequences are flanked by TA target site duplications and have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) similar to TIRs of DNA transposons. The sequences of five other families of repeats, MER41, MER48, MER50, MER51, and RMER3, resemble long terminal repeats of retroviruses. A potential involvement of some of the reported MER repeats in the regulation of transcription and genetic rearrangements is suggested. Age estimations place the origin of most MER repeats at the time of decline in MIR (Mammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats) retroposition and before the origin of the Alu family MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence that STAT1 binds to multiple distinct motifs upon interferon-gamma stimulation in vivo. While a large majority of genomic sites with high ChIP-seq signal is associated with a nucleotide sequence resembling a STAT1 binding site, only a very small subset of the over 5 million potential STAT1 binding sites in the human genome is covered by ChIP-seq data. Furthermore a surprisingly large fraction of the ChIP-seq signal (5%) is absorbed by a small family of repetitive sequences (MER41). The observation of the binding of activated STAT1 protein to a specific repetitive element bolsters similar reports concerning p53 and other TFs, and strengthens the notion of an involvement of repeats in gene regulation. Incidentally MER41 are specific to primates, consequently, regulatory mechanisms in the IFN-STAT pathway might fundamentally differ between primates and rodents. On a methodological aspect, the presence of large numbers of nearly identical binding sites in repetitive sequences may lead to wrong conclusions about intrinsic binding preferences of TF as illustrated by the spacing analysis STAT1 tandem motifs. Therefore, ChIP-seq data should be analyzed independently within repetitive and non-repetitive sequences MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites.

Dovitinib triggered a G2 /M arrest in cancer cell lines from diverse origins including HeLa, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Single-cell analysis revealed that Dovitinib promoted a delay in mitotic exit in a subset of cells, causing the cells to undergo mitotic slippage. Higher concentrations of Dovitinib induced a G2 arrest similar to the G2 DNA damage checkpoint.  Finally, Dovitinib-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death could be promoted after DNA damage repair was disrupted by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases.  Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with dovitinib resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and blockade of bFGF-induced cell migration. Finally, Dovitinib-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death could be promoted after DNA damage repair was disrupted by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases.

Treatment with vitamin C led to rapid recovery of symptoms.   Scurvy, or "Barlow's disease", is a widely described disease involving cutaneous and mucosal lesions resulting from vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy, a disease of dietary deficiency of vitamin C, is uncommon today. Because many of the early symptoms of vitamin C deficiency (fatigue, malaise, depression and irritability) are non-specific, the diagnostic possibility of scurvy is usually delayed until haemorrhagic manifestations occur. Scurvy is caused by prolonged dietary deficiency of vitamin C, the plasma concentration of which appears inversely related to mortality from all causes Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man Ascorbic acid is a vitamin soluble in water and its deficiency in human body causes scurvy. Deficiencies in vitamin C can lead to conditions such as scurvy, which, among other ailments, causes gingivia, bone pain, and impaired wound healing. Severe deficiency leads to scurvy, whereas a limited vitamin C intake causes general symptoms, such as increased susceptibility to infections, fatigue, insomnia, and weight loss. Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy a serious and painful disease in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong connective tissue, gums deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and wounds do not heal. The human body is unable to synthesise Vitamin C and a diet deficient in Vitamin C leads to scurvy. Scurvy may mimic other medical conditions, like bleeding diasthesis or deep vein thrombosis, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment, thus prolonging sufferings of patients. Often, scurvy could have been diagnosed if it is thought of and features of scurvy carefully looked for. Scurvy, a disease of dietary deficiency of vitamin C, is uncommon today.

5509b6d22e93f0133a000005	What are the treatments of choice for GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor)?	Traditionally, the treatment of choice for primary disease is surgical resection no single surgeon or institution gets extensive exposure to these patients so appropriate decision-making is difficult, particularly since the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which has become an important additional management tool Surgery aiming at an R0 resection remains the mainstay of treatment. The treatment of choice for GIST is surgical resection Extra luminal colonic gastrointestinal stromal tumors are very rare and can present as mass abdomen. Resection is the treatment of choice. Surgery remains the only curative treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). When they are localized, the treatment of choice is surgical excision, but advanced tumors have a limited response to chemo or radiotherapy. Imatinib (STI571 or Glivec) is a selective inhibitor or tyrosine kinase proteins that has been used successfully in the treatment of advanced GIST. Therefore Imatinib can be a therapeutic alternative in patients with metastatic GIST. The surgical resection is a treatment of choice for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It has been shown that adequate surgical resection correlates with high 5-years survival rates for patients with gastric GIST. Approximately 80% of patients with metastatic GIST benefit from imatinib, although acquired resistance to the agent may develop. For patients with primary GIST, surgery remains the treatment of choice, and whether outcome is improved by adjuvant imatinib is currently under broad investigation.  combination of imatinib therapy and surgery also may be effective in a subset of patients with metastatic or unresectable primary GIST	['The surgical resection is a treatment of choice for gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

While no stand-alone test was sufficiently accurate for classifying HPV-associated OPSCC, the high sensitivity and specificity of the established combination of p16 immunostain, DNA ISH, and HPV16 DNA amplification suggests that the introduction of labour- and cost-intensive mRNA ISH, is not necessary in the diagnostic routine of oropharyngeal tumors. p16INK4a (p16) tumor-suppressor protein is a biomarker of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenic activity that has revealed a high rate of positivity in histological high-gade squamous intraepithelial lesion/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (HSIL/CIN2) lesions.

5e4bf7876d0a27794100002c	What is the effect of notch in the division of neural progenitor cells in Drosophila?	Studies on Drosophila neural progenitors have provided valuable insight into how evolutionarily conserved protein cassettes may be differentially deployed in different developmental contexts to mediate asymmetric divisions Asymmetric cell divisions can be mediated by the preferential segregation of cell-fate determinants into one of two sibling daughters. Here we show that the retromer complex directly and specifically regulates Notch receptor retrograde trafficking in Drosophila neuroblast lineages to ensure the unidirectional Notch signaling from neural progenitors to neuroblasts. The correct establishment and maintenance of unidirectional Notch signaling are critical for the homeostasis of various stem cell lineages Our results therefore unveil a safeguard mechanism whereby retromer retrieves potentially harmful Notch receptors in a timely manner to prevent aberrant Notch activation-induced neural progenitor dedifferentiation and brain tumor formation. Notch/Hes signaling and miR-9 engage in complex feedback interactions controlling neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Canonical Notch signaling has diverse functions during nervous system development and is critical for neural progenitor self-renewal, timing of differentiation and specification of various cell fates In the adult mammalian brain niches for neural stem cells are maintained, which enable a steady-state neurogenesis. This process is tightly regulated by multiple niche factors, including Notch and NF-κB signaling. As a result of Notch activation, neuronal differentiation is inhibited in neighboring cells and they remain neural progenitor cells. We highlight the role of Notch signaling in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The Notch pathway mediates expansion of a progenitor pool and neuronal differentiation in adult neural progenitor cells after stroke. Inhibition of the Notch pathway with a gamma secretase inhibitor further substantially increased neurons, but did not alter astrocyte population in ischemic neural progenitor cells.  The activation of NOTCH signalling by DELTA-1 in the adjacent progenitors inhibits neurogenesis and is required to maintain proliferation. We show that conditional expression of a constitutively active form of Notch1 in early neural progenitor cells, but not postmitotic neurons, selectively induces extensive apoptosis, resulting in a markedly reduced progenitor population. This dynamic mode of gene expression would require a revision of the traditional view of how Notch-mediated lateral inhibition operates in the developing mammalian nervous system. Our data therefore suggest that Numb controls the balance between Notch receptor recycling and receptor targeting to late endosomes to regulate signaling output after asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neural progenitors. Studies of the mechanisms controlling the fine balance between neural stem cells and more differentiated progenitors have shown that, in every asymmetric cell division, progenitors send a Delta-Notch signal to their sibling stem cells. Notch activity in neural progenitors coordinates cytokinesis and asymmetric differentiation.	["The Notch pathway mediates the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in Drosophila.

5314d05adae131f84700000d	What is the role of brain natriuretic peptide in traumatic brain injury patients ?	This study provides evidence that BNP plasma concentrations increase rapidly after TBI. Plasma BNP concentrations are correlated with hyponatremia in severe TBI patients but not in mild and moderate TBI patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated ICP have a higher serum BNP level in first 4 days after injury. In average, the peak of BNP level was measured at 703.9 pg/mL±179.1 pg/mL on day 3 after injury, which was correlated to the severity of TBI. Among patients with severe TBI, plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with hyponatremia were statistically higher than those without hyponatremia (p<0.05). In the hyponatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP increased to a peak of 1001.16 pg/mL±131.52 pg/mL within 48 hours after injury and maintained at a high level for 3 days. In the normonatremic group, the plasma NT-proBNP reached a peak of 826.43 pg/mL±337.43 pg/mL on day 5 and quickly decreased thereafter. In addition, we found plasma NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with ICP>15 mm Hg were significantly higher than those in patients with ICP≤15 mm Hg (p<0.01).  There is emerging evidence to suggest that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated after acute brain injury, and that it may play an adaptive role in recovery through augmentation of cerebral blood flow (CBF).  hBNP improves neurological function in murine models of TBI and ICH, and was associated with enhanced CBF and downregulation of neuroinflammatory responses. hBNP may represent a novel therapeutic strategy after acute CNS injury. Here, we describe 2 cases of CSW in TBI patients with elevated BNP levels. These patients with TBI had findings consistent with CSW with elevated BNP levels in the setting of normal cardiac function. We measured NT-proBNP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 14 patients suffering from severe TBI (GCS15 mm Hg (n=6), the serum (800+/-150 pg/mL) and CSF levels (55+/-9 pg/mL) of NT-proBNP were significantly increased after 24 h, as compared to patients with ICP15 mm Hg.  BNP plasma concentrations are elevated shortly after head injury and are continuously elevated during the acute phase in patients with more extensive SAH and in those with elevated ICP, and correlate with poor outcomes.  BACKGROUND: According to the literature, serum beta-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been shown to increase in adult trauma patients, specifically for those with traumatic brain injury and in those with intracranial hemorrhage.	['Brain natriuretic peptide concentrations are elevated in patients with traumatic brain during the acute phase and correlate with poor outcomes.

570906fecf1c325851000010	What is the effect that EZH2 has on chromatin?	Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms Ez that catalyzes di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K37me2/3), marks repressive to transcription. We report that the mammalian homologs Ezh1 and Ezh2 form similar PRC2 complexes but exhibit contrasting repressive roles. During progenitor cell differentiation and ageing, PcG silencer EZH2 attenuates, causing loss of PRC binding and transcriptional activation of INK4b and INK4a the PRC2-Ezh2 complex, which is bound to the myogenin (MyoG) promoter and muscle creatine kinase (mCK) enhancer in proliferating myoblasts, and the PRC2-Ezh1 complex, which replaces PRC2-Ezh2 on MyoG promoter in post-mitotic myotubes In this study, we found the inverse correlation between FOXP3 and Ezh2, an enzyme for histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and a central epigenetic regulator in cancer The chromatin-modifying enzyme Ezh2 is critical for the maintenance of regulatory T cell identity after activation CD28 co-stimulation, an extracellular cue intrinsically required for Treg cell maintenance, induced the chromatin-modifying enzyme, Ezh2 Treg-specific ablation of Ezh2 resulted in spontaneous autoimmunity with reduced Foxp3(+) cells in non-lymphoid tissues and impaired resolution of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis These studies reveal a critical role for Ezh2 in the maintenance of Treg cell identity during cellular activation We assessed the effect of efficient RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 on RUNX3 levels, cell viability and H3K27 trimethylation of the RUNX3 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We found that siRNAs Ezh2 and post-transcriptional silencing of Ezh2 by let-7 g rescued this effect suggesting that Ezh2 up-regulation is in part responsible for increased H3K27me3 and decreased rates of up-regulation of differentiation genes in Dicer(-/-)ES. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed binding of EZH2 at the p57kip2 promoter and reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation upon gene suppression. The E(z) gene family reveals a striking functional conservation in mediating gene repression in eukaryotic chromatin: extra gene copies of human EZH2 or Drosophila E(z) in transgenic flies enhance position effect variegation of the heterochromatin-associated white gene, and expression of either human EZH2 or murine Ezh1 restores gene repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that are impaired in telomeric silencing. The authors further showed that forced expression of SAFB1 increases H3K27me3 at AR target loci and this effect requires EZH2. We assessed the effect of efficient RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 on RUNX3 levels, cell viability and H3K27 trimethylation of the RUNX3 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation.  Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, plays a key role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Our objectives were to determine the expression pattern of EZH2 and to assess the anticancer effect of EZH2 depletion in pancreatic cancer cells. We assessed the effect of efficient RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 on RUNX3 levels, cell viability and H3K27 trimethylation of the RUNX3 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation. EZH2 interacts directly with Snail2, and Snail2 fails to expand the neural crest domains in the absence of Ezh2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Snail2 regulates EZH2 occupancy and histone H3K27 trimethylation levels at the promoter region of the Snail2 target E-cadherin. To identify direct target genes of Ezh2, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments followed by whole-genome promoter arrays (chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip) and identified 5585 genes associated with trimethylation of lysine 27 in histone 3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed binding of EZH2 at the p57kip2 promoter and reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation upon gene suppression. YY1 was required for Ezh2 binding because RNA interference of YY1 abrogated chromatin recruitment of Ezh2 and prevented H3-K27 methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Snail2 regulates EZH2 occupancy and histone H3K27 trimethylation levels at the promoter region of the Snail2 target E-cadherin. Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms.

Knockdown of SNX27 by siRNA in HEK293 cells raised MRP4 expression on the plasma membrane, increased the extrusion of 6-[(14)C]mercaptopurine, an MRP4 substrate, and conferred resistance against 6-[(14)C]mercaptopurine. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is a 62-kDa protein localized to early endosomes and known to regulate the intracellular trafficking of ion channels and receptors. Finally, migration assays revealed that depletion of SNX27 from HeLa and mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells significantly decreases cell motility. We propose a model by which SNX27 regulates trafficking of β-Pix to focal adhesions and thereby influences cell motility. We found that SNX27a redirected part of 5-HT4(a)R to early endosomes. sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a recently described member of a protein family involved in intracellular trafficking, SNX27 co-localized with transferrin receptor-positive vesicles, pointing to its participation in T cell endocytic recycling. This protein is a unique member of the sorting nexin family of proteins, a group generally involved in the endocytic and intracellular sorting machinery These previously unreported results indicate that SNX27 is a participant in NK cell polarization, as a mediator or target of the mechanism. Like most sorting nexins, SNX27 possesses a functional PX domain that selectively binds the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and is important for trafficking to the early endosome. This is consistent with a role of SNX27 as a general regulator for sorting of membrane proteins containing a PDZ-binding motif, and its absence may alter the trafficking of these proteins, leading to growth and survival defects. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to the sorting nexin family of proteins, which participate in vesicular and protein trafficking. Similarly to all sorting nexin proteins, SNX27 has a functional PX domain that is important for endosome binding, but it is the only sorting nexin with a PDZ domain. These results identify SNX27 as a PDZ-containing component of the T cell immunological synapse, and demonstrate a role for this protein in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between SNX27 and DGKζ. Sorting nexins have been implicated in trafficking of proteins through endosomal compartments.

54fd5dd86ad7dcbc12000008	How does phospholamban affect the biological activity of the calcium ATPase SERCA?	Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. SR calcium uptake is mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition.  Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA.  Phospholamban (PLN) regulates cardiac contractility via its modulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity. Impairment of this regulatory process causes heart failure. Based on structural and dynamics data, we propose a model in which PLN undergoes allosteric activation upon encountering SERCA. The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism. We found that the allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation at Ser-16 of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle.

The identification of genetic variants affecting gene expression, namely expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), has contributed to the understanding of mechanisms underlying human traits and diseases. The majority of these variants map in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome and their identification remains challenging. Here, we use natural genetic variation and CAGE transcriptomes from 154 EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from unrelated individuals, to map 5376 and 110 regulatory variants associated with promoter usage (puQTLs) and enhancer activity (eaQTLs), respectively. We characterize five categories of genes associated with puQTLs, distinguishing single from multi-promoter genes. Among multi-promoter genes, we find puQTL effects either specific to a single promoter or to multiple promoters with variable effect orientations. Regulatory variants associated with opposite effects on different mRNA isoforms suggest compensatory mechanisms occurring between alternative promoters. Our analyses identify differential promoter usage and modulation of enhancer activity as molecular mechanisms underlying eQTLs related to regulatory elements.

52ed264a98d023950500002f	Provide examples of how molecular transporters contribute to multi-drug resistance in bacteria.	 One of the common mechanisms of multidrug resistance in eukaryotic cells is the active efflux of a broad range of xenobiotics through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Overall, the phylogenetic diversity of As-resistant bacteria in underground water was very limited if compared with lentic and lotic waters. Lastly, our molecular data support the hypothesis that the horizontal gene transfer of ars in As-containing freshwater environments is not limited to closely-related genomes, but also occurs between bacteria that are distant from an evolutionary viewpoint, thereby indicating that such genetic events may be considered a source of microbial resistance to arsenic-toxicity. We postulate that the RND transporter All3143 and the predicted membrane fusion protein All3144, as homologs of E. coli AcrB and AcrA, respectively, are major players for antibiotic resistance in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. These observations suggest a physiological association between c-di-AMP and the MDR transporters and support the model that MDR transporters mediate c-di-AMP secretion to regulate peptidoglycan synthesis in response to cell wall stress. Our data suggest that SmbFT truly displays immunity function and confer protection against Smb and structurally similar lantibiotics. This study indicates that the tetA gene decreases sensitivity to tigecycline in Salmonella spp. at a low level. With additional resistance mechanisms, tetA-carrying strains can reach the breakpoint for tigecycline resistance. Efflux pump inhibitors may inhibit the major AcrAB-TolC in Salmonella efflux systems which are the major efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance in Gram-negative clinical isolates. (RND)-type efflux transporters play the main role in intrinsic resistance to various antimicrobial agents in many gram-negative bacteria. Here, we estimated 12 RND-type efflux transporter genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus.	["MDR efflux pumps began causing clinical problems relatively recently, in parallel with the extensive use of antibiotics in medicine and as supplements in animal feeds. However, our analyses indicate that these MDR efflux pumps did not arise through recent mutations in genes encoding transporters that changed their substrate specificities.\n\nInstead, such MDR pumps are encoded within the genomes of virtually all microorganisms, so these genes are present and thus need only to be activated to become problematic. Moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. Finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs)."]

58efa66070f9fc6f0f000005	Can aspirin be used in cancer prevention?	 Evidence for an association between aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been inconsistent.  We report for the first time, in a typical risk US clinical population, a lack of protective association of aspirin for polyps among active smokers. Future prospective studies are recommended to confirm this mitigating effect in order to improve the precision of the growing evidence base about the chemopreventive benefit of aspirin in colorectal cancer. The most serious side effect of prolonged aspirin treatment is haemorrhage, especially from the GI tract. This is likely to be less of a problem with chemoprevention at lower doses. One also needs to consider the impact if aspirin resistance, an increasingly recognised clinical entity. Overall, our results do support the hypothesis that use of NSAIDs or statins may reduce the odds of developing pancreatic cancer. Understanding is growing of the possible mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its anticancer effects.  Long-term aspirin use was associated with a modest but significantly reduced risk for overall cancer, especially gastrointestinal tract tumors. Regular aspirin use may prevent a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers and complement the benefits of screening.

551c2cd26b348bb82c00000d	Does helicobacter pylori infection increase risk for ischemic stroke?	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is reported to be associated with many extragastrointestinal manifestations, such as hematological diseases [idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IDA)], cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart diseases), neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), obesity and skin disorders. Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to high risk of ischemic stroke: evidence from a meta-analysis. This meta-analysis indicated that chronic H. pylori infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of IS, especially for non-cardioembolic IS.  In the last years, a considerable number of studies have been performed on the relationship between infection from Helicobacter Pylori and atherosclerotic diseases, like stroke and ischemic heart disease.  However, there are conflicting results on the relevance of chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study does not reveal any strong association between chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke.  Case-control and prospective studies indicate that chronic infections, such as periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infection with Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Cytomegalovirus, might increase stroke risk, although considerable variation exists in the results of these studies, and methodological issues regarding serological results remain unresolved. Chronic infections, presently discussed as stroke risk factors mainly include periodontitis and infections with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp).  CONCLUSION: H. Pylori gastritis is not independently associated with increased risk for stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that CagA-seropositive strains infection is significantly associated with susceptibility to ischemic strokes and coronary heart diseases.  BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between CagA-positive H. pylori strains and ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CagA-positive strains of H. pylori are significantly associated to atherosclerotic stroke. We concluded that H pylori infection is common in DM and seems to be linked to the presence of atherosclerosis and ischemic cerebrovascular stroke.  Interesting results show that H. pylori infection affects atherosclerosis and is weakly associated with ischemic heart disease and stroke. Moreover, CagA-positive H. pylori strains may play a role in the natural history of atherosclerotic stroke. Interestingly, the majority of the extradigestive-related literature is focused on two vascular manifestations: stroke and ischemic heart disease.  Chronic infectious diseases that may increase the risk of stroke include periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infections with microbial antigens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H. pylori infection is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and that CD14 polymorphism is not.  CONCLUSIONS: Our case-control study provides evidence of an association between the immune response to H. pylori , a marker of prior infection with this organism and noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. Case-control studies and a few prospective studies have indicated that chronic infections may add to the risk of stroke and that acute infections may act as trigger factors for stroke. Such chronic infections include periodontal disease, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, and chronic bronchitis Chronic H. pylori infection still showed an overall association with ischemic stroke (odds ratio for all subtypes combined: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.09-6.08) after adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors. These results suggest that chronic H. pylori infection may be a triggering factor that increases the risk of acute ischemic stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies on Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of ischemic stroke yielded variable results.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis of an association between infection with CagA-positive H. pylori strains and acute cerebral ischemia.  Chronic infections (eg, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori) were found to increase the risk of stroke; however, study results are at variance, residual confounding is not excluded, and causality is not established at present.  CONCLUSIONS: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of stroke and increased fibrinogen levels but these findings can be attributed to a confounding effect of socio-economic status.  CONCLUSIONS: Hp infection represents risk factor of ischemic stoke via an interaction of Hp cytotoxins or cytokines with atherosclerotic plaques in carotic arteries. CONCLUSIONS: The association between H pylori and acute cerebrovascular disease seems to be due to a higher prevalence of more virulent H pylori strains in patients with atherosclerotic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection appears to be significantly more frequent in middle-aged patients with acute ischemic stroke than in controls. Chronic H pylori infection was associated with a higher risk of stroke caused by small-artery occlusion (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.15 to 9.56) and a lower risk of cardioembolic stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.71). Overall, elevated H pylori as well as elevated C pneumoniae antibodies were not associated with ischemic stroke. Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  H. pylori seropositivity may be an independent risk factor for stroke of atherothrombotic origin. Appropriately randomized studies employing an antibiotic treatment for patients affected by ischemic vascular disease will answer the question of whether H. pylori has a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Results on the association between this bacterium and acute myocardial infarction or stroke are controversial, due to the degree of studies heterogeneity.  Interventional randomized studies employing an antibiotic treatment for patients affected by ischemic vascular diseases will rapidly answer the question of wheather Helicobacter pylori has a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSION: Chronic H pylori infection is an independent risk factor for ischaemic cerebrovascular disease and may act, at least in part, by increasing atherosclerosis. Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This case-control study does not reveal any strong association between chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke. However, there are conflicting results on the relevance of chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for ischemic stroke.

554500065beec11c1000000b	What is the mechanism of drug-induced gingival overgrowth?	The results indicated that CsA stimulated cell proliferation in the pediatric fibroblast cell line The mechanism of a CsA-induced fibroblast overgrowth may converge on the steps involving fibroblast proliferation and cytokine network including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and PGE2, in both adults and pediatrics  Comparison between the results in the adult and pediatric groups demonstrated that the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and PGE2 were significantly higher in the pediatric group than in the adult group; however, statistics showed no significant difference in the levels of TNF-α and TGF-β1 and CsA-induced proliferation between these two groups Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is a frequent adverse effect associated principally with administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A and also certain antiepileptic and antihypertensive drugs The results suggest that the increased epithelial thickness observed in Cyclosporin A-induced gingival overgrowth is associated with increased proliferative activity in keratinocytes It is well-known that the anticonvulsant drug, phenytoin (PHT), induces gingival overgrowth as a side effect. The mechanism of PHT-induced gingival overgrowth, however, is not well understood. Gingival overgrowth is a frequent and adverse side-effect caused by certain immunosuppressant, anti-convulsant and calcium channel-blocking drugs. Although the precise mechanism is not yet known, the enhanced proliferation of gingival fibroblasts observed in this disease could be caused at least partly by the effects of the drugs on the cell cycle and cyclin expression in these cells Thus, the increase in cell growth that occurs in drug-induced gingival overgrowth may be mediated by over-expression of cyclin B1 The immunosuppressant and hyperplasia-inducing drug cyclosporin A regulates the cell cycle and cyclin B1 gene expression in gingival fibroblasts in vitro Cathepsin-L, a key molecule in the pathogenesis of drug-induced and I-cell disease-mediated gingival overgrowth A calcium antagonist, nifedipine, specifically suppressed cathepsin-L activity and mRNA expression, but not that of cathepsin-B in cultured gingival fibroblasts Since cathepsin-L deficiency was reported to be associated with thickening of the skin, impaired cathepsin-L activity may play a key role in the establishment of skin and gingival abnormalities seen in I-cell disease. In addition, reduced cathepsin-L activity may play an important role in inducing drug-induced gingival overgrowth Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (GO) is a frequent and adverse side-effect associated principally with the administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and also certain anti-epileptic and anti-hypertensive drugs. It is characterized by a marked increase in the thickness of the epithelial layer and the accumulation of excessive amounts of connective tissue Although the mechanism by which the drugs cause GO is not yet understood, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which is a potent epithelial cell mitogen, has been implicated in other hyperplastic conditions, including mammary and prostatic hyperplasia, and could also be involved in the molecular pathology of GO This study has shown, for the first time, that the level of KGF is elevated in GO and suggests that KGF may have an important role in the enhanced epithelial proliferation associated with GO Certain anticonvulsants, cyclosporine, and a variety of calcium channel blockers have been shown to produce clinically and histologically similar gingival enlargements in certain susceptible patients	['Drug-induced gingival overgrowth (GO) is a frequent and adverse side-effect associated principally with the administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and also certain anti-epileptic and anti-hypertensive drugs.

601c33f81cb411341a000017	What is the mechanisms of action of Evinacumab?	Evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL3, has been shown to substantially reduce LDL-C of an average of 49%, independently of residual LDLR activity.  RECENT FINDINGS: Novel therapies, not dependent on a functioning LDLR include lomitapide and mipomersen, which decrease hepatic apolipoprotein B secretion, and evinacumab, directed at the angiopoietin like-3 protein (ANGPLT-3). Multiple ANGPLT3 inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. Moreover, regarding TG a monoclonal antibody called evinacumab and an antisense-oligonucleotide against ANGPTL3 showed effective TG-lowering.  Current therapies reduce plaque volume, but targeting all apoB-containing lipoproteins with intensive combinations that include alirocumab or evinacumab, monoclonal antibodies against cholesterol-regulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and angiopoietin-like protein 3, may provide more benefit. Evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL3, has shown potential benefit in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. These include an antisense oligonucleotide against apoC-III (volanesorsen), a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein-3 (evinacumab), and other agents currently in development.

56c5ade15795f9a73e000003	What is the role of 5hmC (5 hydroxy-methyl-Cytocine) in differentiation?	5-Methylcytosine (5 mC) in genomic DNA has important epigenetic functions in embryonic development and tumor biology. The modification of DNA by 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has essential roles in cell differentiation and development through epigenetic gene regulation. Notably, the balance between 5hmC and 5mC in the genome is linked with cell-differentiation processes such as pluripotency and lineage commitment. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 targets, ultimately contributing to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development. Tet1 and Tet2 catalyzed conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in Foxp3 to establish a Treg-cell-specific hypomethylation pattern and stable Foxp3 expression Consequently, Tet1 and Tet2 deletion led to Foxp3 hypermethylation, impaired Treg cell differentiation and function, and autoimmune disease. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), converted from 5-methylcytocine (5mC) by Tet family of dioxygenases (Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3), is enriched in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the brain We found that Tet3 expression is basically undetectable in ESCs, but its level increases rapidly during neuronal differentiation. 5mC oxidation by Tet2 modulates enhancer activity and timing of transcriptome reprogramming during differentiation Recent experiments have demonstrated that enhancers are enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidization product of the Tet family of 5mC dioxygenases and an intermediate of DNA demethylation. By mapping DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation Loss of Tet enzymes compromises proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells These findings suggest a requirement for Tet- and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation in proper regulation of gene expression during ESC differentiation and development. We show that 5hmC is enriched in the gene body of highly expressed genes at all developmental stages and that its presence correlates positively with gene expression. Dynamic hydroxymethylation of deoxyribonucleic acid marks differentiation-associated enhancers In this study, we show by genome-wide mapping that the newly discovered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is dynamically associated with transcription factor binding to distal regulatory sites during neural differentiation of mouse P19 cells and during adipocyte differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells Hence, acquisition of 5hmC in cell-specific distal regulatory regions may represent a major event of enhancer progression toward an active state and participate in selective activation of tissue-specific genes. We find that 5hmC is mostly associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is under-represented at gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with increased transcriptional levels Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related genes (including Esrrb, Prdm14, Dppa3, Klf2, Tcl1 and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for extraembryonic lineage differentiation  Tet2 deficiency led to decreased genomic levels of 5hmC and augmented the size of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pool in a cell-autonomous manner. In competitive transplantation assays, Tet2-deficient HSCs were capable of multilineage reconstitution and possessed a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in enhanced hematopoiesis into both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. However, the role of 5hmC and Tet family in the process of ESC differentiation especially neuronal differentiation remains elusive Our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmC in T-cell development and differentiation More recently, a possible role of 5hmC as an epigenetic modifier and/or transcriptional regulator has started to emerge, with altered levels in early embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation and tumours (Tahiliani et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2012).  Here we report a method that combines TET-assisted bisulfite conversion with Illumina 450K DNA methylation arrays for a low-cost high-throughput approach that distinguishes 5hmC and 5mC signals at base resolution. Implementing this approach, termed "TAB-array", we assessed DNA methylation dynamics in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiovascular progenitors and neural precursor cells. With the ability to discriminate 5mC and 5hmC, we identified a large number of novel dynamically methylated genomic regions that are implicated in the development of these lineages.  5-hydroxy methyl cytosine (5hmC) is a modification identified in vertebrates several decades ago. More recently, a possible role of 5hmC as an epigenetic modifier and/or transcriptional regulator has started to emerge, with altered levels in early embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation and tumours (Tahiliani et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2012).

5ab908d4fcf456587200001a	What is the alternative lengthening of telomeres?	By comparing these ALT cells with parental telomerase positive cells, we observed that ALT cells possess excessively long telomeric overhangs derived from telomere elongation processes that mostly occur during S phase. ALT cells exhibited preferential elongation of the telomeric lagging strands, whereas telomerase positive cells exhibited similar elongation between leading and lagging strands. We propose that the ALT pathway preferentially occurs at telomeric lagging strands leading to heterogeneous telomere lengths observed in most ALT cancers. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase independent telomere maintenance mechanism that occurs in ∼15% of cancers.

52f88a062059c6d71c000032	What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK	Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a small part. The vast majority of citizens in nine European countries systematically overestimate the benefits of mammography and PSA screening. In the countries investigated, physicians and other information sources appear to have little impact on improving citizens' perceptions of these benefits. National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside randomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or quality of life in men with screen-detected disease. In the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has been accepted in the United Kingdom. Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom.  the positive predictive value of PSA screening in BRCA mutation carriers is high and that screening detects clinically significant prostate cancer. Web-based decision aids are known to have an effect on knowledge, attitude, and behavior; important components of informed decision making Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was introduced as a prostate cancer screening tool more than 20 years ago. However, there is continuing debate regarding its utility in screening for prostate cancer. Mass screening is costly, may result in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers that never become clinically significant, and the evidence of a subsequent reduction in mortality is inconclusive. In addition to its role in screening, PSA is also used to monitor the progression of the disease, both localized and metastatic. Although the evidence is contradictory, PSA is still an important tool for monitoring patient progression following treatment of definitive localized prostate cancer.	['Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom. Two systematic reviews have concluded that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has been accepted in the United Kingdom.']

54f1e4d0c409818c32000002	What is the mechanism of action of eprotirome?	Eprotirome and Sobetirome are 2 thyromimetics that have selective TRβ1 activity.  Recently, the development of the most promising agent in this class, eprotirome, was halted over toxicology concerns following long-term canine studies. Consequently, the future of contemporary TRβ agonists is unclear.  We designed novel thyromimetics with high receptor (TRβ) and organ (liver) selectivity based on the structure of eprotirome (3) and molecular modeling.  In humans, eprotirome exerts favorable lipid-modulating effects while lacking thyroid hormone-related side-effects and maintaining normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback. This review details recent advances in the development of TRβ subtype- and liver-selective STRM analogs, and presents the results of preliminary clinical trials with one of these compounds, eprotirome (KB-2115; Karo Bio AB). Examples of synthetic analogues are GC-1 (or sobetirome) and KB2115 (or eprotirome) which show ipolipidaemic and antiaterogenic capacities.  METHODS: The history of thyromimetics in atherosclerosis and dyslipidaemia is reviewed as the background to the recent publication of the first human data on a new selective thyromimetic, KB-2115 (eprotirome).

Association between endometriosis and genetic polymorphisms of the estradiol-synthesizing enzyme genes HSD17B1 and CYP19 Here, we evaluated whether the risk and severity of endometriosis are associated with polymorphisms in estradiol-synthesizing enzyme genes: the Ser312Gly polymorphism in 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) and the Arg264Cys polymorphism in cytochrome P450, subfamily XIX (CYP19) Individuals having at least one A-allele (A/G or A/A genotype) of HSD17B1 showed a significantly increased risk of endometriosis (A/G genotype: adjusted OR, 3.06; 95%CI 1.21-7.74; A/A genotype: adjusted OR, 3.02; 95%CI 1.08-8.43). There was a significant trend associating A/G + A/A genotypes with severity of endometriosis (P for trend<0.01).  Evidence for association between the Ser312Gly polymorphism in HSD17B1 and endometriosis was found in a Japanese population. The A-allele of HSD17B1 appears to confer higher risk for endometriosis.

532f062ad6d3ac6a34000027	What is the effect of ivabradine in heart failure after myocardial infarction?	Ivabradine may be important for the improvement of clinical outcomes in patients with LV systolic dysfunction and heart rate ≥ 70 b.p.m., whatever the primary clinical presentation (CAD or HF) or clinical status (NYHA class). Treatment with ivabradine was associated with a 13% relative risk reduction for the composite of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization (P < 0.001 vs. placebo); this was driven by HF hospitalizations (19%, P < 0.001).  Ivabradine (IVA), a pure HR lowering drug, reduces the demand of myocardial oxygen during exercise, contributes to the restoration of oxygen balance and is therefore beneficial in chronic CVD. No relevant negative effects have been observed on cardiac conduction, contractility, relaxation, repolarization or blood pressure (BP). The most significant results were obtained in the subgroup of patients with life-limiting exertional angina. In this group, ivabradine significantly reduced the primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for fatal and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or heart failure, by 24%, and hospitalizations for AMI by 42%. In the subgroup of patients with baseline heart rate >70 bpm, hospitalizations for AMI and revascularization were reduced by 73% and 59%, respectively Indeed, heart rate reduction with ivabradine, a selective and specific I(f) inhibitor, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium. Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. The beneficial effects of ivabradine may be due to the reversal of electrophysiological cardiac remodelling in post-MI rats by reduction of functional overexpression of HCN channels. This is attributable to transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Addition of ivabradin to standard treatment of SCCF after MI promoted less frequency of hospitalizations, recurrent non-fatal MI, fatal cardiovascular events. This effect was especially strong in high baseline HR. The most important finding of the study was that patients with high baseline HR had an increase in serious cardiovascular events including death (34%), hospital admission secondary to congestive heart failure (53%), acute myocardial infarction (46%), or revascularization procedure (38%). In addition, in the subset analysis focusing on patients with baseline HR > or =70 bpm and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% the agent resulted in a 36% decrease in hospital admissions secondary to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and a 30% decrease in coronary revascularization. In the subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate > or =70 bpm, treatment with ivabradine resulted in a significant, 36% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and a 20% reduction in the need for coronary revascularisation. Ivabradine was well tolerated, with an increased rate of treatment discontinuation, mainly due to bradycardia, compared with placebo. Ivabradine did not significantly affect the combined primary endpoint. Significant reduction by 36% (p = 0.001) in myocardial infarction and by 30% (p = 0.016) in coronary revascularization was observed in the pre-defined subgroup of patients with heart rate > or = 70/min.  In conclusion, these data indicated that HR reduction by Iva prevents the worsening of LV dysfunction and remodeling that may be related to a downregulation of cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system transcripts. Interstitial fibrosis in the MI-remote LV was markedly reduced by Iva (4.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1%, P < 0.005).  Although both metoprolol and ivabradine comparably prevented post-MI deterioration of haemodynamic function in the rat, metoprolol had additional potentially beneficial effects; it prevented LV dilation and hypertrophy, chronotropic incompetence, strongly increased contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes, and prevented the potentially proarrhythmic increase in NCX activity. In rats with CHF, long-term HRR induced by the selective I(f) inhibitor ivabradine improves LV function and increases stroke volume, preserving cardiac output despite the HRR. The improvement of cardiac function is related not only to the HRR per se but also to modifications in the extracellular matrix and/or function of myocytes as a consequence of long-term HRR.	['Ιvabradine decreases heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium. Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction.

54f09a5894afd6150400001c	What is known about the value of mindfulness interventions in prostate cancer patients?	Participants reported regular mindfulness training practice, and there was a significant correlation between mindfulness training practice and changes in both initiation and maintenance of the change in A:V. These pilot results provide encouraging evidence for the feasibility of a dietary program that includes mindfulness training in supporting dietary change for men with recurrent prostate cancer and invite further study to explore the possible role of mindfulness training as a means of supporting both initiation of dietary changes and maintenance of those changes over time. FINDINGS: Following the 6-week MBSR program, patients showed improvements in stress and anxiety (p < .05); caregivers' psychological and QOL also improved but were not statistically significant. Both patients and caregivers had decreases in cortisol at Weeks 1 and 3 (p < .05) but not at Week 6. Similar to cortisol levels at Week 6, salivary interleukin-6 levels were lower overall (before/after an MBSR-C session), compared with Week 1 for patients and caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR-C may be a beneficial intervention for reducing stress, anxiety, cortisol levels, and symptoms in advanced-stage cancer patients and may also benefit caregivers. ESULTS: Significant improvements were observed for anxiety (p = 0.027), avoidance (p = 0.032), and mindfulness skills (p = 0.019), with a trend for a reduction in fear of cancer recurrence (p = 0.062). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based group interventions appear to have utility in this patient group and show promise for reducing anxiety, avoidance, and fear of cancer recurrence.   Linear mixed modeling showed significant improvements in overall symptoms of stress which were maintained over the follow-up period. Cortisol levels decreased systematically over the course of the follow-up. Immune patterns over the year supported a continued reduction in Th1 (pro-inflammatory) cytokines. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from pre- to post-intervention and HR was positively associated with self-reported symptoms of stress. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR program participation was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms, altered cortisol and immune patterns consistent with less stress and mood disturbance, and decreased blood pressure.  Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality, but these improvements were not significantly correlated with the degree of program attendance or minutes of home practice.  CONCLUSIONS: MBSR program enrollment was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients, and resulted in possibly beneficial changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning.  Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality. Although there were no significant changes in the overall number of lymphocytes or cell subsets, T cell production of IL-4 increased and IFN-gamma decreased, whereas NK cell production of IL-10 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR participation was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients. This study is also the first to show changes in cancer-related cytokine production associated with program participation. CONCLUSIONS: Our small study provides evidence that a plant-based diet delivered in the context of MBSR decreases the rate of PSA increase and may slow the rate of tumor progression in cases of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.	['In prostate cancer patients, mindfulness interventions were well accepted and were effective in reducing stress, anxiety, avoidance, fear of cancer recurrence, cortisol levels and blood pressure, and improving quality of life, sleep quality and immune system functioning.

516c0dc6298dcd4e5100006c	What is the role of AMPK kinase in myocardial remodeling after myocardial infarction	These data suggest that adiponectin protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through both AMPK- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms. The improved cardiac function was associated with decreased atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels in the metformin-treated group (50% reduction compared with MI, P < 0.05). Molecular analyses suggested that altered AMP kinase phosphorylation status and low insulin levels mediate the salutary effects of metformin. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of cellular energy. The activation of AMPK by metformin prevents cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). These results suggest that AMPK activation by metformin and the subsequent suppression of TLRs activity could be considered as a target in protecting the infarcted heart, which may indicate a link between AMPK and TLRs.

534428feaeec6fbd0700000a	What are cancer driver genes?	We constructed DriverDB (http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/driverdb/), a database which incorporates 6079 cases of exome-seq data, annotation databases (such as dbSNP, 1000 Genome and Cosmic) and published bioinformatics algorithms dedicated to driver gene/mutation identification. DriverDB: an exome sequencing database for cancer driver gene identification. With the ability to fully sequence tumor genomes/exomes, the quest for cancer driver genes can now be undertaken in an unbiased manner. Here we show that the combination of complementary methods allows identifying a comprehensive and reliable list of cancer driver genes.  In summary, the catalog of driver genes and the methodology presented here open new avenues to better understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. A subset of these mutations contribute to tumor progression (known as "driver" mutations) whereas the majority of these mutations are effectively neutral (known as "passenger" mutations) The ability to differentiate between drivers and passengers will be critical to the success of upcoming large-scale cancer DNA resequencing projects.  In fact, recent sequencing and resequencing (i.e., polymorphism identification) efforts have catalyzed the quest for protein kinase 'driver' mutations (i.e., those genetic alterations which contribute to the transformation of a normal cell to a proliferating cancerous cell) in distinction to kinase 'passenger' mutations which reflect mutations that merely build up in course of normal and unchecked (i.e., cancerous) somatic cell replication and proliferation. This method was applied to available breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma sequence data, and identified Wnt/TGF-beta cross-talk, Wnt/VEGF signaling, and MAPK/focal adhesion kinase pathways as targets of rare driver mutations in breast, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma, respectively. Analysis of the frequency of specific mutations across different tumors has been able to identify some, but not all of the mutated genes that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. We are developing a cross-species comparison strategy to distinguish between cancer driver- and passenger gene alteration candidates, by utilizing the difference in genomic location of orthologous genes between the human and other mammals. Major tumor sequencing projects have been conducted in the past few years to identify genes that contain 'driver' somatic mutations in tumor samples. At the same time, we determined that some genes previously reported as drivers were not significant by the new analysis because mutations in these genes occurred mainly in tumors with large background mutation rates.  Identifying genomic alterations driving breast cancer is complicated by tumor diversity and genetic heterogeneity. Herein we report a proof-of-principle study illustrating a novel dog-human comparison strategy that addresses a central aim of cancer research, namely cancer driver-passenger distinction. Expansion of this study would make more driver-passenger distinctions for cancers with large genomic amplifications or deletions, and address key questions regarding the relationship between cancer pathogenesis and epithelial cell polarity control in mammals. Adjusting for background mutation frequency biases improves the identification of cancer driver genes. The identification of cancer drivers is a major goal of current cancer research We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers.

56f403d009dd18d46b000004	Which is the most well-accepted method for Down syndrome non-invasive prenatal diagnosis?	Potential of syncytiotrophoblasts isolated from the cervical mucus for early non-invasive prenatal diagnosis Maternal serum protein profile and immune response protein subunits as markers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21, 18, and 13 Maternal serum protein profiling using proteomics may allow non-invasive diagnostic testing for the most common trisomies and may complement ultrasound-based methods to more accurately determine pregnancies with fetal aneuploidies The presence of foetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA Using massively parallel sequencing, foetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 have been detected from maternal plasma. These developments suggest that the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma would play an increasingly important role in future obstetrics practice. Currently, two applications for NIPD of Down syndrome have been developed with potential and have displayed positive results; the NIPD using next-generation sequencing technologies and the NIPD using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from the plasma of peripheral blood from 121 women 9-20 weeks of pregnancy. Five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in PLAC4 gene were analyzed by reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA), followed by capillary electrophoresis Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 by dosage ratio of fetal chromosome-specific epigenetic markers in maternal plasma This study examined the methylation difference in AIRE and RASSF1A between maternal and placental DNA, and the implication of this difference in the identification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and in prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Diagnosis of trisomy 21 was established according to the ratio of fetal-specific AIRE to RASSF1A in maternal plasma. Both methods confirmed that AIRE and RASSF1A were hypomethylated in maternal blood cells but hypermethylated in placental or chorionic villus tissues. It was concluded that hypermethylated AIRE and RASSF1A may serve as fetal-specific markers for the identification of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and may be used for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21. Preliminary reports indicate that the detection of fetal aneuploidies might be possible using epigenetically modified genes, e.g. maspin on chromosome 18. Additionally, an exiting recent development is that it might be feasible to detect Down syndrome via the quantitative assessment of placentally derived cell-free mRNA of chromosome-21-specific genes such as PLAC4 Candidate epigenetic biomarkers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome Next, it was shown that the methylation status of chorionic villus sample DNA from first trimester pregnancies matched the hypermethylated state of term placenta.

587f8324d8d850a152000003	What is the link between Ctf4 and Chl1 in cohesion establishment?	Ctf4 Links DNA Replication with Sister Chromatid Cohesion Establishment by Recruiting the Chl1 Helicase to the Replisome. The Eco1 acetyltransferase, helped by factors including Ctf4 and Chl1, concomitantly acetylates the chromosomal cohesin complex to stabilize its cohesive links. Here we show that Ctf4 recruits the Chl1 helicase to the replisome via a conserved interaction motif that Chl1 shares with GINS and polymerase α. The Chl1 helicase facilitates replication fork progression under conditions of nucleotide depletion, partly independently of Ctf4 interaction. Conversely, Ctf4 interaction, but not helicase activity, is required for Chl1's role in sister chromatid cohesion. A physical interaction between Chl1 and the cohesin complex during S phase suggests that Chl1 contacts cohesin to facilitate its acetylation. Our results reveal how Ctf4 forms a replisomal interaction hub that coordinates replication fork progression and sister chromatid cohesion establishment. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.

Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants. Here we show that this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7).  We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.  Natural RNA sponges sequestering cellular noncoding RNA molecules have been found in diverse organisms. n this issue, Lalaouna et al.

Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression This can involve RNA sponges that sequester regulatory RNAs of mRNAs in the same regulon, but the underlying molecular mechanism of such mRNA cross talk remains little understood.

5a86ecc7faa1ab7d2e000039	What is the function of the H19 (ICR) locus in the human genome?	We found that localized DNA demethylation at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) induced by 5-AzaCdR, reduced IGF2, increased H19 expression, increased CTCF and cohesin recruitment and changed histone modifications. Furthermore chromatin accessibility was increased locus-wide and chromatin looping topography was altered such that a CTCF site downstream of the H19 enhancers switched its association with the CTCF site upstream of the IGF2 promoters to associate with the ICR. The parent-of-origin-dependent expression of IGF2 and H19 is controlled by the imprinting center 1 (IC1) consisting of a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator In conclusion, methylation defects at the IGF2-H19 locus can result from inherited mutations of the imprinting center and have high recurrence risk or arise independently from the sequence context and not transmitted to the progeny. Specific epigenetic alterations of IGF2-H19 locus in spermatozoa from infertile men. In the teratozoospermia group, 11 of 19 patients presented a loss of methylation at variable CpG positions either in the IGF2 DMR2 or in both the IGF2 DMR2 and the 6th CTCF of the H19 DMR  This study demonstrates that epigenetic perturbations of the 6th CTCF site of the H19 DMR might be a relevant biomarker for quantitative defects of spermatogenesis in humans. Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) The two alternative chromatin conformations are differently favoured in BWS and SRS likely predisposing the locus to the activation of IGF2 or H19, respectively Epigenetic status of the H19 locus in human oocytes following in vitro maturation. To evaluate if maturing human oocytes in vitro would be hazardous at the epigenetic level, we first determined the methylation profile of the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR). The methylation status of the H19 DMR seems particularly vulnerable to in vitro culture conditions We have identified a region with characteristics of a paternal-specific methylation imprint at the human H19 locus Structural analysis revealed the presence of CpG islands and a large direct repeat with a 400 bp sequence reiterated several times, but no significant sequence homology to the corresponding region of the mouse H19 gene. These findings could suggest a role for secondary DNA structure in genomic imprinting across the species, and they also present a puzzling aspect of the evolution of the H19 regulatory region in human and mouse. Mouse/human sequence divergence in a region with a paternal-specific methylation imprint at the human H19 locus. Furthermore, the chromatin loop organized by the CTCF-bound, differentially methylated region at the Igf2/H19 locus can be detected in mitosis. The H19 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor. The H19 locus belongs to a cluster of imprinted genes that is linked to the human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The expression of H19 and its closely associated IGF2 gene is frequently deregulated in some human tumors, such as Wilms' tumors. The H19 locus thus clearly displays a tumor suppressor effect in mice. Mono-allelic expression at the mouse IGF2/H19 locus is controlled by differential allelic DNA methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR). In the mouse Igf2/H19 imprinted locus, differential methylation of the imprinting control region (H19 ICR) is established during spermatogenesis and is maintained in offspring throughout development. Imprinted expression of the mouse Igf2/H19 locus is controlled by parent-of-origin-specific methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR). The imprinted expression of the mouse Igf2/H19 locus is governed by the differential methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR), which is established initially in germ cells and subsequently maintained in somatic cells, depending on its parental origin. Microdeletions at the human H19/IGF2 ICR (IC1) are proposed to be responsible for IC1 epimutations associated with imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). CTCF binding sites and DNA methylation at the ICR have previously been identified as key cis-acting elements required for proper H19/Igf2 imprinting. Genomic imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus is governed by a cis-acting Imprinting-Control Region (ICR), located 2 kb upstream of the H19 gene. A maternally inherited H19 ICR inhibits Igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses H19 gene transcription by promoter DNA methylation when paternally inherited. Thus, the ICR autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta-globin gene locus, but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous Igf2/H19 locus. Like most imprinted genes, H19 and Igf2 are regulated by a differentially methylated imprinting control region (ICR). It is thought that the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) directs the silencing of the maternally inherited Igf2 allele through a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator. Mutation of CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional epigenetic marks. Thus, the ICR autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta-globin gene locus, but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous Igf2/H19 locus.<br> the imprinted expression of the mouse igf2 h19 locus is governed by the differential methylation of the imprinting control region icr which is established initially in germ cells and subsequently maintained in somatic cells depending on its parental origin by grafting a 2 9 kbp h19 icr fragment into a human beta globin yeast artificial chromosome in transgenic mice we previously showed that the icr could recapitulate imprinted methylation and expression at a heterologous locus suggesting that the h19 icr in the beta globin locus contained sufficient information to maintain the methylation mark k tanimoto m shimotsuma h matsuzaki a omori j bungert j d engel and a fukamizu proc natl acad sci usa 102 10250 10255 2005 curiously however the transgenic h19 icr was not methylated in sperm which was distinct from that seen in the endogenous locus here we reevaluated the ability of the h19 icr to mark the parental origin using more rigid criteria in the testis the methylation levels of the solitary 2 9 kbp transgenic icr fragment varied significantly between six transgenic mouse lines however in somatic cells the paternally inherited icr fragment exhibited consistently higher methylation levels at five out of six randomly integrated sites in the mouse genome these results clearly demonstrated that the h19 icr could acquire parent of origin dependent methylation after fertilization independently of the chromosomal integration site or the prerequisite methylation acquisition in male germ cells. mono allelic expression at the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by differential allelic dna methylation of the imprinting control region icr because a randomly integrated h19 icr fragment when incorporated into the genome of transgenic mice tgm was allele specifically methylated in somatic but not in germ cells it was suggested that allele discriminating epigenetic signature set within or somewhere outside of the tg h19 icr fragment in germ cells was later translated into a differential dna methylation pattern to test if the chicken β globin hs4 chs4 chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the h19 icr we inserted the h19 icr fragment flanked by a set of floxed chs4 core sequences into a human β globin locus yac and generated tgm insulated icr tgm as controls the chs4 sequences were removed from one side 5 hs4 deleted icr or both sides pseudo wt icr of the insulated icr by in vivo cre loxp recombination the data show that while maternally inherited transgenic h19 icr was not methylated in insulated icr tgm it was significantly methylated upon paternal transmission though the level was lower than in the pseudo wt icr control because this reduced level of methylation was also observed in the 5 hs4 deleted icr tgm we speculate that the phenotype is due to vezf1 dependent demethylation activity rather than the insulator function borne in chs4 collectively although we cannot rule out the possibility that chs4 is incapable of blocking an allele discriminating signal from outside of the transgene the epigenetic signature appears to be marked intrinsically within the h19 icr. a subset of genes in mammals are subject to genomic imprinting the mouse h19 gene for example is active only when maternally inherited and the neighboring igf2 gene is paternally expressed this imprinted expression pattern is regulated by the imprinting control region icr upstream of the h19 gene a maternally inherited h19 icr inhibits igf2 gene activation by the downstream enhancer due to its insulator function while it suppresses h19 gene transcription by promoter dna methylation when paternally inherited these parent of origin specific functions depend on the allele specific methylation of the icr dna which is established during gametogenesis therefore the icr may also function as a landmark for epigenetic modifications to examine whether the icr confers these activities autonomously we introduced a 2 9 kbp icr containing dna fragment into a human beta globin yeast artificial chromosome at the 3 end of the locus control region and established transgenic mouse lines expression of all of the beta like globin genes was higher when the transgene was paternally inherited in accord with this result transgenic icr dna from nucleated erythrocytes was more heavily methylated when paternally transmitted chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ccctc binding factor is preferentially recruited to the maternal transgenic icr in vivo surprisingly however the parent of origin specific methylation pattern was not observed in germ cell dna in testis demonstrating that methylation was established after fertilization thus the icr autonomously recapitulated imprinting within the normally nonimprinted transgenic beta globin gene locus but the temporal establishment of imprinting methylation differs from that at the endogenous igf2 h19 locus. genomic imprinting at the h19 igf2 locus is governed by a cis acting imprinting control region icr located 2 kb upstream of the h19 gene this region possesses an insulator function which is activated on the unmethylated maternal allele through the binding of the ctcf factor it has been previously reported that paternal transmission of the h19 silk deletion which removes the 3 portion of h19 icr leads to the loss of h19 imprinting here we show that in the liver this reactivation of the paternal h19 gene is concomitant to a dramatic decrease in igf2 mrna levels this deletion alters higher order chromatin architecture igf2 promoter usage and tissue specific expression therefore when methylated the 3 portion of the h19 icr is a bi functional regulatory element involved not only in h19 imprinting but also in formatting the higher order chromatin structure for proper tissue specific expression of both h19 and igf2 genes. imprinted expression of the mouse igf2 h19 locus is controlled by parent of origin specific methylation of the imprinting control region icr we previously demonstrated that when placed in a heterologous genomic context the h19 icr fragment contains an intrinsic activity that allows it to acquire differential methylation in somatic cells but not in germ cells in the present study we investigated the requirements for the ctcf binding sites of the icr in the acquisition of post fertilization methylation to this end two mutant icr fragments were introduced into the human beta globin locus in a yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse tgm model 4xmut had mutations in all four icr ctcf binding sites that prevented ctcf binding but retained the methylation target cpg motifs and 9cg harbored mutations in the cpg motifs within the ctcf binding sites but each site retained constitutive ctcf binding activity in tgm germ cells and pre implantation blastocysts the absence of ctcf binding sites 4xmut did not lead to hypermethylation of the transgenic h19 icr however after implantation the mutations of ctcf sites 4xmut and 9cg affected the maintenance of methylation these results demonstrated that although the ctcf binding sites are indispensable for maintenance of the unmethylated state of the maternal icr in post implantation embryos they are not required to establish paternal allele specific methylation of the transgenic h19 icr in pre implantation embryos. one of the best studied read outs of epigenetic change is the differential expression of imprinted genes controlled by differential methylation of imprinted control regions icrs to address the impact of genotype on the epigenome we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic mz and 128 pairs of dizygotic dz twins interrogating the dna methylation status of the icrs of igf2 h19 kcnq1 gnas and the non imprinted gene runx1 while we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between mz and dz twins we also observed a high degree of variability in individual cpg methylation levels notably at the h19 igf2 loci a degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed with both local and regional cpg methylation changes discordant between mz and dz individual pairs however concordant gains or losses of methylation within individual twin pairs were more common in mz than dz twin pairs indicating that de novo and or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying dna sequence specifically for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 a polymorphism located in a critical ctcf binding site in the h19 icr locus is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific cpg sites in the maternal h19 allele together our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while dna methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.	['We found that localized DNA demethylation at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) induced by 5-AzaCdR, reduced IGF2, increased H19 expression, increased CTCF and cohesin recruitment and changed histone modifications.', "The H19 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor. The H19 locus belongs to a cluster of imprinted genes that is linked to the human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

588f9b7eed9bbee70d000003	Describe clinical manifestation of the Mal de debarquement syndrome.	Mal de debarquement (MdD) is a subjective perception of self-motion after exposure to passive motion, in most cases sea travel, hence the name. Mal de debarquement occurs quite frequently in otherwise healthy individuals for a short period of time (several hours). However, in some people symptoms remain for a longer period of time or even persist and this is then called mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS). OBJECTIVE: Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a balance disorder that typically starts after an extended exposure to passive motion, such as a boat or plane ride.  Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a rare and poorly understood condition of perceived continual motion. BACKGROUND: Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a disorder of chronic self-motion perception that occurs though entrainment to rhythmic background motion, such as from sea voyage, and involves the perception of low-frequency rocking that can last for months or years.  It is characterized by abnormal sensation of motion/balance reported after travel by air, land, and sea; being reexposed to motion/activity relieves it. Symptoms may last from minutes to years.  Persistent mal de debarquement syndrome: a motion-induced subjective disorder of balance. Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a disorder of phantom perception of self-motion of unknown cause.  Mal de debarquement (MDD) is a common, benign, and self-limited syndrome suffered by many people after disembarkation from an oceangoing vessel. Persistent mal de debarquement syndrome: a motion-induced subjective disorder of balance.

6027fa581cb411341a0000ee	Describe participants' experiences from the 100,000 genomes project	In this paper, we present findings from a project involving 20 patients with rare diseases, or parents thereof, participating in the 100,000 genomes project (100 kG P). We explored their experiences of, and views about, the project, including why they took part, and their hopes and concerns about the future of genomic medicine. Patients who attended genetic clinics for testing were offered the opportunity to undergo the more extensive whole genome sequencing (WGS) if they agreed to take part in the 100 kG P. Once people had agreed, a specific additional appointment was organised for them. Taking part in the project therefore involved additional travel and appointments ('clinical labour'). We found that interviewees' decisions to participate in 100 kG P were based on interpersonal and institutional trust in the NHS, and on an investment in improving care for the future. Interviewees relied upon receiving good ongoing NHS care for managing their own or their child's rare disease, but they worried about what their relationships with NHS healthcare professionals would be like in future. A few participants worried about whether Genomics England's biorepository would remain protected and an asset of the NHS.

5c663c547c78d69471000014	What is the mechanism of action of anlotinib?	Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has already shown antitumor effects in various types of carcinoma in a phase I clinical trial.  OBJECTIVES: AL3818 (anlotinib) is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2/KDR, and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (C-kit), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFβ), and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3).  In the present study, we detailed the pharmacological properties of anlotinib, a highly potent and selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, in preclinical models.  In this research, we demonstrated that anlotinib, a potent multi-tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), showed a significant inhibitory effect on VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Wound healing assay, chamber directional migration assay and tube formation assay indicated that anlotinib inhibited VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced cell migration and formation of capillary-like tubes in endothelial cells.  Mechanistically, anlotinib inhibits the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1 as well their common downstream ERK signaling.  Anlotinib inhibits angiogenesis via suppressing the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1. BACKGROUND: Anlotinib (AL3818) is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibiting tumour angiogenesis and proliferative signalling.  Anlotinib is a novel TKI targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit. The tolerability profile of anlotinib is similar to that of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways; however, anlotinib has a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or higher side effects compared to that of sunitinib.  Importance Anlotinib is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling. OBJECTIVES Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine Kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR2/3, FGFR1-4, PDGFD α/β, c-Kit and Ret. BACKGROUND Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to primarily inhibit VEGFR2/3, FGFR1-4, PDGFR α/β, c-Kit, and Ret. Anlotinib: a novel multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development. Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. BACKGROUND Anlotinib (AL3818) is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibiting tumour angiogenesis and proliferative signalling. Collectively, these results indicate that anlotinib is a well-tolerated, orally active VEGFR2 inhibitor that targets angiogenesis in tumor growth, and support ongoing clinical evaluation of anlotinib for a variety of malignancies. Anlotinib occupied the ATP-binding pocket of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase and showed high selectivity and inhibitory potency (IC50 <1 nmol/L) for VEGFR2 relative to other tyrosine kinases. Although anlotinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been reported have antitumor effects in many preclinical and clinical trials, little is known about its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importance Anlotinib is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling. Anlotinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, with a broad spectrum of inhibitory effects on tumour angiogenesis and growth.

CONCLUSION: Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors.  Dental x-rays and risk of meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to some dental x-rays performed in the past, when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era, appears to be associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma.  n the present article the authors review the literature relating to radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs). Emphasis is placed on meningiomas resulting from childhood treatment for primary brain tumor or tinea capitis, exposure to dental x-rays, and exposure to atomic explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Frequency of full-mouth dental X-ray examinations after age 25 related to both glioma (P for trend = 0.04) and meningioma risk (P for trend = 0.06). In brain tumor studies, the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies. BACKGROUND  This study evaluates the risk of benign brain tumors (BBTs) and malignant brain tumors (MBTs) associated with dental diagnostic X-ray, using a large population-based case-control study. In a few studies examining health effects related to dental X-ray exposure, possibly increased risks of meningioma and thyroid cancer were suggested. No significant association was found between MBTs and dental diagnostic X-ray exposure. We found a statistically significant positive association of brain cancer with reported exposure to dental X-rays. CONCLUSION  Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors. Prospective studies, based on dental X-ray records and patient follow-up, are needed to test the hypothesis further and clarify the possible cancer risk associated with dental radiography, as although the risk at the individual level, particularly with improved technology/equipment, is likely to be very low, the proportion of the population exposed is high. In brain tumor studies , the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies CONCLUSIONS Exposure to dental diagnostic X-rays in oral and maxillofacial care increases the risk of BBTs, but not MBTs. With the objective to inform clinical practice and guidelines, we synthesized the current epidemiological evidence on the association between dental X-rays and the risk of thyroid cancer, meningioma, and other cancers of the head and neck region. In brain tumor studies, the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies. In a few studies examining health effects related to dental X-ray exposure, possibly increased risks of meningioma and thyroid cancer were suggested.

5507ea9a0195c16935000008	What type of arrhythmia is known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BDVT)?	Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with alternating polarity of the QRS complex most commonly described digitalis toxicity.  Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity. Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively. When the heart rate exceeded the threshold for bigeminy at the first site in the His-Purkinje system, ventricular bigeminy developed, causing the heart rate to accelerate and exceed the threshold for bigeminy at the second site. Thus, the triggered beat from the first site induced a triggered beat from the second site. The triggered beat from the second site next reciprocated by inducing a triggered beat from the first site, and so forth. Bigeminy from two sites produced BVT, and that from three or more sites produced polymorphic VT. This "ping pong" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy. The BVT, in this case, was most likely due to myocardial ischema. The ethiology of published BVT cases are most commonly digitalis toxicity and rarely herbal aconitine poisoning, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, cathecolaminergic VT, myocarditis, and Anderson-Tawil syndrome. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), although a rare arrhythmia in the general population, is frequently observed in patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome and long QT interval. However, the pharmacologic treatment of this arrhythmia remains unknown. This report suggests that flecainide can be effective in controlling BVT associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome and indicates that the left ventricular dysfunction is secondary to the arrhythmia and not due to an associated phenotypic manifestation of the disorder. Based on similarity of electrocardiographic features, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia has been considered a variant of long QT syndrome. Double ventricular ectopic rhythms had bizarre abnormal QRS complexes of two different morphologies and were inscribed in opposite directions. Ectopic rhythms in each case had parasystolic characteristics. These observations suggest bifocal automaticity as a mechanism for bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, defined as the rapid alternation of the QRS complexes with successive opposing axial deviation, is a rare arrhythmia. In the rare cases which have undergone endocavitary investigations, an infrahisian origin has generally been proved. However, the mechanism of these tachycardias remains poorly understood and is discussed with respect to a new case. In the light of previously reported cases with documented endocavitary investigation and this new case, it seems possible to talk in terms of true "bidirectional ventricular tachycardia", a tachycardia whose mechanism is obscure but certainly not univocal. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with alternating polarity of the QRS complex most commonly described digitalis toxicity.

5a87140a61bb38fb24000003	What is Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer?	In nature, cervids are infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions by oral and nasal mucosal exposure, and studies of early CWD pathogenesis have implicated pharyngeal lymphoid tissue as the earliest sites of prion accumulation. Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe.  Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in cervids (i.e., deer, elk, moose, and reindeer), and sheep scrapie, are caused by the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a disease-causing conformer (PrPSc) Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease of North American deer, elk and moose, affects both free-ranging and captive cervids. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an evolving prion disease of cervids (deer, elk and moose) that has been recognized in North America and Korea. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) in North America. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease affecting North American cervids, has been discovered in at least 12 states and provinces throughout the continent. The etiology of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a relatively new and burgeoning prion epidemic in deer, elk, and moose (members of the cervid family), is more enigmatic. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging and uniformly fatal prion disease affecting free-ranging deer and elk and is now recognized in 22 U.S. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting free-ranging and captive cervids that now occurs in 24 U.S. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious, fatal prion disease affecting cervids in a growing number of regions across North America. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting North American cervids.  Prion diseases are neurodegenerative fatal disorders that affect human and non-human mammals. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a prion disease of cervids regarded as a public health problem in North America, and polymorphisms at specific codons in the PRNP gene are associated with this disease Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease of cervids that causes neurodegeneration and death.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has emerged as an important disease of wildlife in North America. The disease is a unique member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases, which naturally affect only a few species.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, emerging disease of cervids associated with transmissible protease-resistant prion proteins. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a contagious prion disease of the deer family, has the potential to severely harm deer populations and disrupt ecosystems where deer occur in abundance. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids is one of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal contagious prion disease in cervids that is enzootic in some areas in North America.  Scrapie amyloid-immunoreactive plaques are present in brain tissues of captive mule deer with chronic wasting disease (CWD), a progressive neurological disorder characterized neuropathologically by widespread spongiform change of the neuropil, intracytoplasmic vacuolation in neuronal perikarya and astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a unique transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni).

5c642fbce842deac67000014	What is PhenomeCentral?	PhenomeCentral: a portal for phenotypic and genotypic matchmaking of patients with rare genetic diseases. The discovery of disease-causing mutations typically requires confirmation of the variant or gene in multiple unrelated individuals, and a large number of rare genetic diseases remain unsolved due to difficulty identifying second families. To enable the secure sharing of case records by clinicians and rare disease scientists, we have developed the PhenomeCentral portal (https://phenomecentral.org). Each record includes a phenotypic description and relevant genetic information (exome or candidate genes).

57092635cf1c325851000019	How does long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occur?	Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) is a mechanism of gene inactivation that affects multiple contiguous CpG islands and has been described in different human cancer types. We demonstrate that LRES also occurs in murine cancer in vivo and mimics the molecular features of the human phenomenon, namely, downregulation of gene expression, acquisition of inactive histone marks, and DNA hypermethylation of specific CpG islands. Malignant regression of cancer cells by in vitro differentiation resulted in partial reversion of LRES and gain of CTCF binding.  genes in LRES regions are plastically regulated in cell differentiation and hyperproliferation, but are constrained to a coordinated repression by abolishing boundaries and the autonomous regulation of chromatin domains in cancer cells. Loss of tumour suppressor gene function can occur as a result of epigenetic silencing of large chromosomal regions, referred to as long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES), and genome-wide analyses have revealed that LRES is present in many cancer types  Epigenetic gene silencing has always been envisaged as a local event silencing discrete genes, but recent data now indicates that large regions of chromosomes can be co-coordinately suppressed; a process termed long range epigenetic silencing (LRES) LRES can span megabases of DNA and involves broad heterochromatin formation accompanied by hypermethylation of clusters of contiguous CpG islands within the region. It is not clear if LRES is initiated by one critical gene target that spreads and conscripts innocent bystanders, analogous to large genetic deletions or if coordinate silencing of multiple genes is important in carcinogenesis This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. The long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) can be a frequent occurrence throughout the human genome.  Consolidation of the cancer genome into domains of repressive chromatin by long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) reduces transcriptional plasticity. By creating an integrated prostate cancer epigenome map using tiling arrays, we show that contiguous regions of gene suppression commonly occur through long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES). We identified 47 LRES regions in prostate cancer, typically spanning about 2 Mb and harbouring approximately 12 genes, with a prevalence of tumour suppressor and miRNA genes. We propose that consolidation or effective reduction of the cancer genome commonly occurs in domains through a combination of LRES and LOH or genomic deletion, resulting in reduced transcriptional plasticity within these regions. It was recently reported that epigenetic suppression of gene expression can also extend to a whole region; this is known as long-range epigenetic silencing. Ikaros hypermethylation occurred in the context of a novel long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) region. Our results not only provide the first evidence that LRES can have functional specific effects in cancer but also identify several deregulated Ikaros targets that may contribute to progression in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Previously, we showed that gene suppression commonly occurs across chromosome 2q14.2 in colorectal cancer, through a process of long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES), involving a combination of DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. We now investigate whether LRES also occurs in prostate cancer across this 4-Mb region and whether differential DNA methylation of 2q14.2 genes could provide a regional panel of prostate cancer biomarkers. Consistent with LRES in colorectal cancer, we found regional epigenetic remodeling across 2q14.2 in prostate cancer.  We were able to gain a comprehensive view of promoters with various CpG densities, including CpG Islands (CGIs), transcript bodies, and various repeat classes. Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) is a mechanism of gene inactivation that affects multiple contiguous CpG islands and has been described in different human cancer types. The CpG island methylator phenotype correlates with long-range epigenetic silencing in colorectal cancer. We now know that tumour suppressor genes, with CpG island-associated promoters, are commonly hypermethylated and silenced in cancer, but we do not understood what triggers this process or when it occurs during carcinogenesis. Epigenetic gene silencing has always been envisaged as a local event silencing discrete genes, but recent data now indicates that large regions of chromosomes can be co-coordinately suppressed; a process termed long range epigenetic silencing (LRES).

The vibrational theory of olfaction assumes that electron transfer occurs across odorants at the active sites of odorant receptors (ORs), serving as a sensitive measure of odorant vibrational frequencies, ultimately leading to olfactory perception.

It differs from previous vibrational theories (Dyson, Wright) in providing a detailed and plausible mechanism for biological transduction of molecular vibrations: inelastic electron tunnelling. Elements of the tunnelling spectroscope are identified in putative olfactory receptors and their associated G-protein.

LB100 sensitized ovarian carcinoma lines to cisplatin-mediated cell death. Sensitization via LB100 was mediated by abrogation of cell-cycle arrest induced by cisplatin. Loss of the cisplatin-induced checkpoint correlated with decreased Wee1 expression, increased cdc2 activation, and increased mitotic entry (p-histone H3). LB100 also induced constitutive hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (BRCA1, Chk2, and γH2AX), altered the chronology and persistence of JNK activation, and modulated the expression of 14-3-3 binding sites.

Herein, we generated a first-in-class humanized antibody (PRL3-zumab) against PRL-3, an intracellular tumor-associated phosphatase upregulated in multiple human cancers, for unconventional cancer immunotherapies. We focused on gastric cancer (GC), wherein elevated PRL-3 mRNA levels significantly correlated with shortened overall survival of GC patients.  Using human GC cell lines, we demonstrated that PRL3-zumab specifically blocked PRL-3+, but not PRL-3-, orthotopic gastric tumors. In this setting, PRL3-zumab had better therapeutic efficacy as a monotherapy, rather than simultaneous combination with 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil alone. PRL3-zumab could also prevent PRL-3+ tumor recurrence. Mechanistically, we found that intracellular PRL-3 antigens could be externalized to become "extracellular oncotargets" that serve as bait for PRL3-zumab binding to potentially bridge and recruit immunocytes into tumor microenvironments for killing effects on cancer cells.

56c06ef5ef6e39474100001e	What is the application of the ASSET algorithm in C.elegans?	ASSET: a robust algorithm for the automated segmentation and standardization of early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. The early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is an attractive model to investigate evolutionarily conserved cellular mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of automated methods to gather quantitative information with subcellular precision in this system. We developed ASSET (Algorithm for the Segmentation and the Standardization of C. elegans Time-lapse recordings) to fill this need. ASSET automatically detects the eggshell and the cell cortex from DIC time-lapse recordings of live one-cell-stage embryos and can also track subcellular structures using fluorescent time-lapse microscopy. Importantly, ASSET standardizes the data into an absolute coordinate system to allow robust quantitative comparisons between embryos. We illustrate how ASSET can efficiently gather quantitative data on the motion of centrosomes and precisely track cortical invaginations, revealing hitherto unnoticed differences between wild-type and saps-1(RNAi) embryos. In summary, we establish ASSET as a novel tool for the efficient quantification and standardization of images from early C. elegans embryos.

571f356f0fd6f91b68000006	What are the skeletal muscle satellite cells?	Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are Pax7(+) myogenic stem cells that reside between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofiber. In mature muscles, SCs are typically quiescent, but can be activated in response to muscle injury. Depending on the magnitude of tissue trauma, SCs may divide minimally to repair subtle damage within individual myofibers or produce a larger progeny pool that forms new myofibers in cases of overt muscle injury Satellite cells (SC) are quiescent adult muscle stem cells critical for postnatal development Satellite cells are multipotential stem cells that mediate postnatal muscle growth and respond differently to temperature based upon aerobic versus anaerobic fiber-type origin Skeletal muscle mass, function, and repair capacity all progressively decline with aging, restricting mobility, voluntary function, and quality of life. Skeletal muscle repair is facilitated by a population of dedicated muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, that reside in anatomically defined niches within muscle tissues. In adult tissues, MuSCs are retained in a quiescent state until they are primed to regenerate damaged muscle through cycles of self-renewal divisions Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. Skeletal muscle satellite cells are quiescent mononucleated myogenic cells, located between the sarcolemma and basement membrane of terminally-differentiated muscle fibres. The acquisition of a proliferating-cell status from a quiescent state as well as the shift between proliferation and differentiation are key developmental steps in skeletal-muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to provide proper muscle regeneration Satellite cells are essential for skeletal muscle regeneration as they ultimately provide the myogenic precursors that rebuild damaged muscle tissue Skeletal muscle satellite cells are committed to myogenesis and do not spontaneously adopt nonmyogenic fates. These are normally quiescent in adult muscle, but act as a reserve population of cells, able to proliferate in response to injury and give rise to regenerated muscle and to more satellite cells. Satellite cell-derived muscle precursor cells may be used to repair and regenerate damaged or myopathic skeletal muscle, or to act as vectors for gene therapy. Research focusing on the canonical adult myogenic progenitor, the skeletal muscle satellite cell, is still an ever-growing field 46 years from their initial description.  Skeletal muscle satellite cells, located between the basal lamina and plasma membrane of myofibers, are required for skeletal muscle regeneration. The capacity of satellite cells as well as other cell lineages including mesoangioblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and side population (SP) cells to contribute to muscle regeneration has complicated the identification of a satellite stem cell.  Muscle satellite cells are a stem cell population required for postnatal skeletal muscle development and regeneration, accounting for 2-5% of sublaminal nuclei in muscle fibers. In adult muscle, satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent.  Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue composed of non-dividing, multi-nucleated muscle fibres that contract to generate force in a controlled and directed manner. Skeletal muscle is formed during embryogenesis from a subset of muscle precursor cells, which generate both differentiated muscle fibres and specialized muscle-forming stem cells known as satellite cells.  Skeletal muscle satellite cells are adult muscle-derived stem cells receiving increasing attention. Sheep satellite cells have a greater similarity to human satellite cells with regard to metabolism, life span, proliferation and differentiation, than satellite cells of the rat and mouse.

56c904745795f9a73e00001c	Describe the usefulness of Macrostomum lignano in ion channel and stem cell research	Bioelectrical signals generated by ion channels play crucial roles in many cellular processes in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Some ion channels are directly implemented in chemical signaling pathways, the others are involved in regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentrations, pH, cell volume, and membrane potentials. Together with ion transporters and gap junction complexes, ion channels form steady-state voltage gradients across the cell membranes in nonexcitable cells. These membrane potentials are involved in regulation of such processes as migration guidance, cell proliferation, and body axis patterning during development and regeneration. While the importance of membrane potential in stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation is evident, the mechanisms of this bioelectric control of stem cell activity are still not well understood, and the role of specific ion channels in these processes remains unclear. Here we introduce the flatworm Macrostomum lignano as a versatile model organism for addressing these topics. We discuss biological and experimental properties of M. lignano, provide an overview of the recently developed experimental tools for this animal model, and demonstrate how manipulation of membrane potential influences regeneration in M. lignano.

5319ac7fb166e2b806000033	What is the role of invadopodia in EMT?	FHOD1, a poorly studied formin, appeared to be markedly upregulated upon EMT. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that FHOD1 contributes to cell migration and invasion. Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix. Our results indicate that FHOD1 participates in cytoskeletal changes in EMT. Invadopodia are considered to be crucial structures that allow cancer cells to penetrate across the extracellular matrix (ECM) by using matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Previously, we isolated a highly invasive A431-III subline from parental A431 cells by Boyden chamber assay. The A431-III cells possess higher invasive and migratory abilities, elevated levels of MMP-9 and an enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. In this study, we discovered that A431-III cells had an increased potential to form invadopodia and an improved capacity to degrade ECM compared with the original A431 cells. Activated Twist upregulates N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin, which are the hallmarks of EMT. Moreover, Twist plays an important role in some physiological processes involved in metastasis, like angiogenesis, invadopodia, extravasation, and chromosomal instability. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important developmental process that has also been implicated in increased cell invasion and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Herein, we demonstrate that TGF-β-induced Hic-5 up-regulation or ectopic expression of Hic-5 in normal MCF10A cells promoted increased extracellular matrix degradation and invasion through the formation of invadopodia. These data identify Hic-5 as a critical mediator of TGF-β-stimulated invadopodia formation, cell migration, and invasion. Recently, invadopodia have been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis. Invadopodia are basally-localized, actin-rich structures that concentrate protease activity to areas of the cell in contact with the extracellular matrix. We recently found that the transcription factor Twist1, a central regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promotes invadopodia formation via upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression and activity. Twist1-induced invadopodia formation promotes tumor metastasis The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation. Twist1 induces PDGFRα expression, which in turn activates Src, to promote invadopodia formation. We show that Twist1 and PDGFRα are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals. Podosome-like structures of non-invasive carcinoma cells are replaced in epithelial-mesenchymal transition by actin comet-embedded invadopodia Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion. In conclusion, EMT affects the invasion machinery of oral squamous carcinoma cells. Non-invasive squamous carcinoma cells constitutively organize podosomes, whereas invasive cells form invadopodia. The club-ended cell extensions, or externalized invadopodia, are involved in ECM degradation and maintenance of contact to adhesion substrate and surrounding cells during invasion. In a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), besides changing their adhesive repertoire, cancer cells employ developmental processes to gain migratory and invasive properties that involve a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the concomitant formation of membrane protrusions required for invasive growth. The molecular processes underlying such cellular changes are still only poorly understood, and the various migratory organelles, including lamellipodia, filopodia, invadopodia and podosomes, still require a better functional and molecular characterization.

BRD4 is a newly characterized transcriptional regulator that represses autophagy and lysosomal function. As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators.

55152c0a46478f2f2c000004	What is the Barr body?	The Barr body is the inactive X chromosome in a female somatic cell. It is readily identified as plano-convex structure of 2-3 micron in diameter on the periphery of the nuclear membrane.  Human inactive X chromosome (Xi) forms a compact structure called the Barr body, which is enriched in repressive histone modifications such as trimethylation of histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me3) and Lys27 (H3K27me3).  In the late 1940s, a microanatomist from London Ontario, Murray Barr, discovered a mark of sex chromosome status in bodily tissues, what came to be known as the 'Barr body'. This discovery offered an important diagnostic technology to the burgeoning clinical science community engaged with the medical interpretation and management of sexual anomalies. Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome in the normal female somatic cell. Inactivation of these chromosomes is known as Lyonization. Lyonization has both genetic and clinical significance.

There is a marked difference between the frequencies of neutrophil nuclear drumsticks and mucosal cell Barr bodies in any given woman despite the fact that both represent an inactivated X chromosome.  Transcriptional inactivation of one X chromosome in mammalian female somatic cells leads to condensation of the inactive X chromosome into the heterochromatic sex chromatin, or Barr body.

Interest has recently reawakened in whether loss of the heterochromatic X chromosome (Barr body) is prevalent in certain breast and ovarian cancers, and new insights into the mechanisms involved have emerged. The centromeres of inactive X chromosomes (Barr bodies) were located closer to the nuclear periphery as compared with the centromeres of active X chromosomes. Long noncoding RNAs and polycomb repression act together to produce an inactive X chromosome, or Barr body.  Barr bodies of characteristic drumstick appearance bearing inactive X chromosome in interphase nuclei of mature granulocytes in fertile female patients exhibited a heterochromatin condensation state similar to nuclear segments.

589ae59c78275d0c4a000036	What is the function of Oseltamivir when administered during flu?	All patients were given specific antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Oseltamivir (has known by its brand name 'Tamiflu') is a prodrug, requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, Oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir was the first orally active neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed by US based Gilead Sciences and is currently marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche). Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein. US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B. Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu.  The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment.  Though therapeutic dose of oseltamivir was given as antiviral treatment for the early therapy, and other therapeutic measures such as energetic respiratory and circulatory support, and immunosuppressant therapy were given Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP; Tamiflu) is a prodrug of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and has been developed for the treatment and prevention of both A and B strains of influenza. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the most important antiviral drug available and a cornerstone in the defence against a future influenza pandemic. The country where oseltamivir is used most is Japan, where it is used to treat seasonal flu. Oseltamivir safety and tolerability were verified in patients with new variant infection A/H1N1. To investigate oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients who were receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study.Intensive care units of an academic medical center.Thirteen critically ill patients aged 13 years or older with suspected or confirmed H1N1 influenza who had a prescription for oseltamivir and were concurrently receiving CVVHD and/or ECMO between October 2009 and January 2010.Oseltamivir 150 mg was administered nasogastrically or nasoenterically every 12 hours The study included 3351 patients in whom influenza had been diagnosed by use of an antigen detection test kit.Oseltamivir was administered to 1818 patients with influenza A and 1485 patients with influenza B. No anti-influenza drugs were administered to 21 patients with influenza A or to 27 patients with influenza B. Patients receiving oseltamivir therapy were divided into 4 groups according to the time between the onset of fever (temperature, > or = 37.5 degrees C) and administration of the first dose of oseltamivir (0-12 h, 13-24 h, 25-36 h, and 37-48 h) To clarify the usefulness of oseltamivir in the elderly we administered oseltamivir to all residents when an influenza A outbreak occurred in a nursing home.Sixty-eight residents in the nursing home were investigated in which the influenza A outbreak occurred; 32 residents had fever and 28 residents were positive for influenza A with direct enzyme immunoassay.Oseltamivir was administered at 75 mg twice daily for 5 days to all residents.Oseltamivir almost inhibited symptom onset in the influenza A-positive afebrile group Oseltamivir was administered to patients with influenza like illness and confirmed influenza, while their close contacts were given oseltamivir prophylactically Insights from investigating the interaction of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) with neuraminidase of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus. Evaluation of treatment with Oseltamivir during the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic: the problem of incomplete clinical information. Immunological effects of the orally administered neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in influenza virus-infected and uninfected mice. Oral oseltamivir improves pulmonary function and reduces exacerbation frequency for influenza-infected children with asthma. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a potent and selective antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA), a flu protein responsible for the release and spread of the progeny virions. Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir) are presently used as an anti-flu drugs. US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B. Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu. Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have good number of interactions with H1N1 2009 virus and the scoring function also support to this result. The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions. However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus. Approximately 1.4% of tested isolates are oseltamivir resistant. We report a patient with an underlying hematological malignancy who was hospitalized with influenza A (H1N1) swine-origin and whose strain developed oseltamivir resistance during therapy. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza. Because abnormal behaviors have been observed in some Japanese teenagers following oseltamivir use, its safety has been questioned. Oseltamivir is known to alter neuronal function and behavior in animals, particularly when administered in combination with ethanol. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting. However, neuropsychiatric behaviors including jumping and falling from balconies by young patients being treated by oseltamivir have been reported from Japan; this has led to warnings against its prescribing by many authorities. However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus. We observed also 10 infections A/H1N1 influenza during pregnancy, with good oseltamivir tolerance and without recent perinathal complications.CONCLUSIONS: Among 109 individuals with swine flu influenza, 67% have not complicated clinical manifestation and they recovered during 3-4 days. The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009.. Most reported that oseltamivir was an effective treatment for the flu. It is needed to perform surveillance on oseltamivir resistance in swine flu. The neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus is the target of anti-flu drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. According to one trial, oseltamivir was moderately effective as a prophylactic for close contacts of 'flu cases (6.6% in absolute values). Oseltamivir: a first line defense against swine flu. Oseltamivir administered daily for six weeks by the oral route is safe and effective for the prevention of influenza..

54dcb29dc0bb8dce23000004	Which pathological condition of the heart is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)?	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disease of the cardiac muscle that occurs mainly due to mutations (>1,400 variants) in genes encoding for the cardiac sarcomere. HCM, the most common familial form of cardiomyopathy, affecting one in every 500 people in the general population, is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and presents variable expressivity and age-related penetrance. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), due to point mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins such as myosin, occurs in 1/500 people and is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals. n HCM, the modified protein function leads, over years to decades, to secondary remodeling with substantial morphological changes, such as hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and extensive fibrosis associated with severe functional deterioration. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young, particularly among athletes. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one the most common heart disorders, with gene mutations in the cardiac sarcomere. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been recently recognized as the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 adults worldwide. HCM is characterized by myocyte hypertrophy resulting in thickening of the ventricular wall, myocyte disarray, interstitial and/or replacement fibrosis, decreased ventricular cavity volume and diastolic dysfunction. HCM is also the most common cause of sudden death in the young. A large proportion of patients diagnosed with HCM have mutations in sarcomeric proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of phenotypic expression, in the absence of another systemic or cardiac disease causing increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, is estimated to be 1:500.  HCM is the most prevalent genetic disorder affecting the heart, it often goes undiagnosed until midlife after patients show symptoms of myocardial remodeling. Adults with cardiomyopathy suffer SCD or adverse events such as stroke and heart failure from HCM. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous autosomal dominant heart disease characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease that is capable of producing significant wall thickening. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited genetic disease characterized by compensatory pathological left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy due to sarcomere dysfunction. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a clinically heterogeneous genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another disease that could explain the wall thickening.

They are composed of three subunits, TcA, TcB and TcC. TcA forms the translocation channel and the TcB-TcC heterodimer functions as a cocoon that shields the toxic enzyme. The toxin complex (tc) genes of Photorhabdus encode insecticidal, high molecular weight Tc toxins. The toxin complex (tc) genes of bacteria comprise a large and growing family whose mode of action remains obscure.  Tc toxins are widely distributed among different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, where they act as pathogenicity factors. Tripartite Tc toxin complexes of bacterial pathogens perforate the host membrane and translocate toxic enzymes into the host cell, including in humans. The underlying mechanism is complex but poorly understood.  Tc toxins from pathogenic bacteria use a special syringe-like mechanism to perforate the host cell membrane and inject a deadly enzyme into the host cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this unusual injection system is poorly understood. Various bacterial toxins have potent insecticidal activity. Recently, the Toxin complexes (Tc's) of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus species have become an increased focus of current research.

Phylogenetic reconstruction using molecular data is often subject to homoplasy, leading to inaccurate conclusions about phylogenetic relationships among operational taxonomic units. Our use of nonhomoplastic whole-genome SNP characters allows branch points and clade membership to be estimated with great precision The control region proved to be a less useful molecular marker for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa in A. urticae than it has for other species. The extreme bias in adenine and thymine content (A+T=90.91%) probably renders this region highly susceptible to homoplasy, resulting in a less informative molecular marker. Minimal homoplasy (consistency index = 0.9591) was detected among parsimony-informative SNPs, allowing for the generation of a highly accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of the CC398 clonal lineage. These findings provide evidence for the occurrence of a high degree of homoplasy in the DR locus leading to convergent evolution to identical spoligotypes. The incongruence between Large Sequence Polymorphism and spoligotype polymorphism argues against the use of spoligotyping for establishing phylogenetic relationships within the Euro-American lineage. The species diversity of the phylum Rotifera has been largely studied on the basis of morphological characters. However, cladistic relationships within this group are poorly resolved due to extensive homoplasy in morphological traits Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic signal) and "false" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy). This added level of homoplasic "noise" can make DNA regions with repeats less reliable in phylogenetic reconstruction than those without repeats. Computational and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only some BH3 motifs arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (homology), whereas others arose by convergent evolution or random coincidence (homoplasy) The high frequency of morphological homoplasy in pennatulaceans has led to many misinterpretations in the systematics of the group. Conflict among data sources can be frequent in evolutionary biology, especially in cases where one character set poses limitations to resolution. Earthworm taxonomy, for example, remains a challenge because of the limited number of morphological characters taxonomically valuable. An explanation to this may be morphological convergence due to adaptation to a homogeneous habitat, resulting in high degrees of homoplasy. This sometimes impedes clear morphological diagnosis of species. We also report one of the first findings of homoplasy in mitochondrial gene order, namely a shared relative position of trnV in unrelated isopod lineages. This taxon therefore provides the opportunity to evaluate those neural characters common to these two clades likely to be results of shared ancestry (homology) versus convergence (homoplasy).  Taxa that experienced molecular homoplasy, recent selection, a spur of evolution, and so forth may disrupt the inference and cause incongruences in the estimated phylogeny. myrmecophagy in these mammalian lineages was more likely because of homoplasy (convergent evolution) than being an ancestral character. The four regions were equally affected by homoplasy and were, therefore, equally unreliable for phylogenetic reconstruction. Early hominid masticatory characters are widely considered to be more prone to homoplasy than characters from other regions of the early hominid skull and therefore less reliable for phylogenetic reconstruction. These findings are in clear contrast with the views that rapidly evolving regions and the 3rd codon position have inevitable negative impact on phylogenetic reconstruction at deep historic level due to accumulation of multiple hits and subsequent elevation in homoplasy and saturation. Phylogenetic reconstructions are often plagued by difficulties in distinguishing phylogenetic signal (due to shared ancestry) from phylogenetic noise or homoplasy (due to character-state convergences or reversals). Homoplasy, in particular, is a difficulty faced by all methods of phylogenetic inference. Homoplasy, in particular, is a difficulty faced by all methods of phylogenetic inference. Sequence-based methods for phylogenetic reconstruction from (nucleic acid) sequence data are notoriously plagued by two effects: homoplasies and alignment errors Early hominid masticatory characters are widely considered to be more prone to homoplasy than characters from other regions of the early hominid skull and therefore less reliable for phylogenetic reconstruction Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic signal) and "false" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy) The four regions were equally affected by homoplasy and were, therefore, equally unreliable for phylogenetic reconstruction mellifera that the detection of size homoplasy may alter phylogenetic reconstructions.	['Evolutionary processes create both newly derived characteristics shared by related descendant lineages (homology) and "false" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy). Homology arises by divergent evolution from a common ancestor and provides us with a phylogenetic signal, while homoplasy arises by convergent evolution or random coincidence. Homoplastic characters do not allows branch points and clade membership to be accurately estimated, as they may group unrelated taxa together. Such characters add "noise" in phylogenetic analysis and are not informative for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa. In phylogenetic reconstruction, homoplasy leads to inaccurate conclusions about phylogenetic relationships among operational taxonomic units, and characters with high degree of homoplasy result in incongruences of cladistic relationships.']
550331abe9bde69634000037	What is the role of venous angioplasty in multiple sclerosis?	Balloon angioplasty corrects blood pressure deviation in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing internal jugular vein dilation. PURPOSE: To investigate prevalence of extracranial abnormalities in azygos and internal jugular (IJ) veins using conventional venography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) being evaluated for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, a condition of vascular hemodynamic dysfunction Feasibility and safety of endovascular treatment for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment for CCSVI appears feasible and safe.  This report presents the case of a 45-year-old man with known MS and suspected CCSVI who had undergone previous internal jugular angioplasty and stenting. The patient reported dramatic improvement of symptoms after intervention.  Open venous reconstruction of the internal jugular vein was performed with a spiral graft from the saphenous vein. The patient's symptoms improved for several weeks until the venous reconstruction occluded. This case is the first reported open venous reconstruction for suspected CCSVI. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in people with multiple sclerosis: a summary of a Cochrane systematic review. BACKGROUND: It has been recently hypothesised that chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The proposed treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the 'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no high level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of CCSVI in people with MS. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that endovascular evaluation and management of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is safe, with low morbidity and no procedure-related mortality. There are clinical trials ongoing or planned to treat chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) through angioplasty.  Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in multiple sclerosis: dichotomy between subjective and objective outcome scores. Some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients reported an improvement after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), despite the lack of correspondence with objective outcome scores.   Spontaneously performed approach to CCSVI does not improve clinical and MRI parameters, despite frequent subjective perception of quality of life improvement. Percutaneous angioplasty of internal jugular and azygous veins in patients with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and multiple sclerosis: early and mid-term results. Purpose: To assess the safety of endovascular treatment of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). .Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of the IJV and azygous veins in patients with CCSVI and MS is a safe procedure with no post-procedural complications followed by significant improvement of IJV flow haemodynamic parameters and decrease in the EDSS score. Whether CCSVI percutaneous treatment might affect clinical improvement in patients suffering from MS is yet to be seen after completion of major multicentric clinical trials, still it seems like that this procedure is not negligible.  CONCLUSIONS: PTA in patients with MS with CCSVI increased CSF flow and decreased CSF velocity, which are indicative of improved venous parenchyma drainage. BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that Multiple sclerosis (MS) stems from a narrowing in the veins that drain blood from the brain, known medically as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI. It has been proposed that balloon angioplasty should alleviate the symptoms of MS.  The revival of this concept has generated major interest in media and patient groups, mainly driven by the hope that endovascular treatment of 'CCSVI' could alleviate MS.  The data obtained here do generally not support the 'CCSVI' concept. Moreover, there are no methodologically adequate studies to prove or disprove beneficial effects of endovascular treatment in MS.  RATIONALE: It is estimated that some hundreds of Canadian patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have journeyed abroad to avail themselves of 'liberation therapy' (venoplasty) following the initial report by Zamboni et al in 2009.  CONCLUSION: No objective improvement was found at one year in thirty MS subjects who had undergone venoplasty, although many reported a degree of subjective benefit. Zamboni et al. reported significant improvement in neurological outcomes in MS patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that PTA in relapsing remitting MS patients was not associated with any neurological improvement. However, there was an increase in disease activity irrespective of the adherence to DMTs. Serious complication of percutaneous angioplasty with stent implantation in so called "chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency" in multiple sclerosis patient. We           strongly ask for restriction of PTA procedure in so called CCSVI, which concept           was not proven to be relevant to MS. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in multiple sclerosis patients. The proposed treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the 'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no high level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for treatment of CCSVI in people with MS.  Significant improvement of clinical disability in relapsing-remitting patients was (P < 0.001) achieved. Data from a few small case series suggest possible improvement of the clinical course and quality of life by performing percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) of the stenotic veins.  CONCLUSION: In the case presented, PTA of the IJV confluence resulted in haemodynamic improvement despite the presence of IJV external compression. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of CCSVI in patients with MS appears to be a safe procedure resulting in significant clinical improvement. Endovascular treatment of concurrent CCSVI seems to be safe and repeatable and may reduce annual relapse rates and cumulative disability in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Therefore, any potentially harmful interventional treatment such as transluminal angioplasty and/or stenting should be strongly discouraged. The work of Dr. Zamboni, et al, who reported that treating the venous stenoses causing CCSVI with angioplasty resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms and quality of life of patients with MS (2) has led to further interest in this theory and potential treatment.  Regardless of this continued uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of this therapy, MS patients from Canada, and other jurisdictions, are traveling abroad to receive central venous angioplasty and, unfortunately, some also receive venous stents.  Finally, no proven (i.e., based on strict scientific methodology and on the rules of evidence-based medicine) therapeutic effect of the "liberation" procedure (unblocking the extracranial venous obstruction using angioplasty) has been shown up to date. The angiographic and hemodynamic improvement was associated with improvement in symptomatology, most particularly in cognitive and constitutional symptoms that may be related to cerebrovenous flow.   In conclusion, in this series, endovascular intervention to correct venous stenosis associated with multiple sclerosis was associated with improvement in symptoms possibly related to disturbed venous hemodynamics.  Some investigators have proceeded to unblinded nonrandomized angioplasty and stenting procedures in patients with CCSVI, with anecdotal reports of symptom improvement. Because of conflicting data on the presence of CCSVI and the absence of controlled trials of CCSVI intervention, the current standard of clinical care is neither to evaluate multiple sclerosis (MS) patients for CCSVI anomalies, nor to intervene with procedures to alter such anomalies. Endovascular treatment (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without stenting) of CCSVI was reported to be feasible with a minor complication rate. PTA seems to be an effective treatment for patients with CCVI and multiple sclerosis, However, randomized studies are warranted to establish the efficacy of this new treatment for MS. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of CCSVI is a safe procedure; there is a 1.6% risk of major complications. CONCLUSIONS: The endovascular treatment in patients with MS and concomitant CCSVI did not have an influence on the patient's neurological condition; however, in the mid-term follow-up, an improvement in some quality-of-life parameters was observed. Although there is no methodologically rigorous evidence to support this hypothesis presently, a considerable number of MS patients have undergone endovascular CCSVI procedures. Such procedures include angioplasty or stent placement in jugular and azygous veins. The safety and efficacy of these procedures is unknown, but not without risk.  CONCLUSIONS: As the debate about CCSVI and its relationship to MS continues, the complications and risks associated with venous stenting and angioplasty in jugular and azygous veins are becoming clearer.  CONCLUSIONS: This study further confirms the safety of PTA treatment in patients with CCSVI associated with MS.  This review aims to describe the proposed association between CCSVI and MS, summarize the current data, and discuss the role of endovascular therapy and the need for rigorous randomized clinical trials to evaluate this association and treatment. CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI. In particular, the potential shift in treatment concepts possibly leading to an interventional treatment approach including balloon angioplasty and venous stent placement is currently being debated.  In conclusion, the present conclusive data confuting the theory of CCSVI in MS should lead to reluctance with respect to the interventional treatment of possible venous anomalies in MS patients. Although balloon angioplasty and stenting seem to be safe procedures, there are currently no data on the treatment of a large group of patients with this vascular pathology.  CONCLUSIONS: The procedures appeared to be safe and well tolerated by the patients, regardless of the actual impact of the endovascular treatments for venous pathology on the clinical course of multiple sclerosis, which warrants long-term follow-up. Two pilot studies demonstrated the safety and feasibility in Day Surgery of the endovascular treatment of CCSVI by means of balloon angioplasty (PTA). It determines a significant reduction of postoperative venous pressure.  However, PTA seems to positively influence clinical and QoL parameters of the associated MS and warrants further randomized control trials. Furthermore, they have obtained apparent clinical improvement or stabilization by endovascular ballooning of points of obstruction in the great veins in some, at least temporarily. A potential shift in the treatment paradigm of MS involving endovascular balloon angioplasty or venous stent placement has been proposed as well as conducted in small patient series. In some cases, it may have resulted in serious injury.   At present, invasive and potentially dangerous endovascular procedures as therapy for patients with MS should be discouraged until such studies have been completed, analyzed, and debated in the scientific arena. She underwent percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the associated chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), due to membranous obstruction of the proximal azygous vein, with severe stenosis of the left internal jugular vein. Treatment of the associated CCSVI made a parallel improvement in both clinical and neurophysiological parameters, allowing us to avoid high dose steroid therapy.  CONCLUSIONS: PTA of venous strictures in patients with CCSVI is safe, and especially in patients with RR, the clinical course positively influenced clinical and QOL parameters of the associated MS compared with the preoperative assessment. In particular, the potential shift in treatment concepts possibly leading to an interventional treatment approach including balloon angioplasty and venous stent placement is currently being debated	["Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

5319a73cb166e2b806000026	What is the mechanism of action of geldanamycin?	Geldanamycin (HSP90 inhibitor) Geldanamycin is an antibiotic originally discovered based on its ability to bind heat-shock protein 90. This interaction can lead to the disruption of heat-shock protein 90-containing multimolecular complexes. It can also induce the inhibition or even degradation of partner proteins dissociated from the 90 kDa chaperone and, eventually, can cause apoptosis, for instance, in PC12 cells. An Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, geldanamycin, inhibits luciferase reactivation demonstrating the importance of the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of E. coli Hsp90 during client protein remodeling. Unique proteome patterns were observed in HeLa cells treated with the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and were similar to the patterns induced by radicicol, a structurally different HSP90 inhibitor. the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90 is an important anticancer drug target because it maintains the conformation, stability, and function of many important oncogenic client proteins, including those involved with signal transduction, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, motility angiogenesis, and metastasis. Using the standard inhibitors of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of Hsp90, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), novel solid-phase immunoassays have been validated using a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) end point. Their utility for confirming the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibition in secondary cell-based assays has been shown and applied to the novel Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159. A recent crystal structure of the NH2-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 established the presence of a conserved nucleotide binding site that is identical with the binding site of geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90. The functional significance of nucleotide binding by Hsp90 has remained unclear. Here we present evidence for a slow but clearly detectable ATPase activity in purified Hsp90.

This protein functions in DNA repair by direct dealkylation of mutagenic O6-alkylguanine. The protein methylated at Cys-69 becomes a transcriptional activator of the genes in the ada regulon, including its own.  O6-Alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) repairs toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic O6-alkylguanine (O6-alkG) lesions in DNA O6-Methylguanine is removed from DNA via the transfer of the methyl group to a cysteine acceptor site present in the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.

The Escherichia coli Ada and Ogt DNA methyltransferases (MTases) are known to transfer simple alkyl groups from O6-alkylguanine and O4-alkylthymine, directly restoring these alkylated DNA lesions to guanine and thymine. During exponential growth, the spontaneous rate of G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to C:G transversions was elevated about fourfold in ada ogt double mutant versus wild-type E. coli. compared with the wild type, stationary populations of the MTase-deficient E. coli (under lactose selection) displayed increased G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions (10- and 3-fold, respectively) and increased G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions (10-, 2.5-, and 1.7-fold, respectively). ATases are able to repair O6-alkylguanine (O6-AlkG) and O4-alkylthymine (O4-AlkT)  The inducible resistance to alkylation mutagenesis and killing in Escherichia coli (the adaptive response) is controlled by the ada gene. The Ada protein acts both as a positive regulator of the response and as a DNA repair enzyme, correcting premutagenic O6-alkylguanine in DNA by suicidal transfer of the alkyl group to one of its own cysteine residues. Forward mutations induced by 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) in the lacl gene of Escherichia coli were recovered from bacteria proficient (Ogt+ Ada+) and deficient (Ogt- Ada-) in O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity. Spontaneous mutagenesis in O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase-proficient and -deficient (ada ogt mutants) Escherichia coli was studied in two ways: in bacteria growing in nonselective liquid medium and in bacteria resting on selective agar plates. We now show by Southern analysis that the mutation involves a gross deletion covering at least the ogt and fnr genes and that no O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase activity is present in cell-free extracts of an ada::Tn10 derivative of these bacteria. O6-Alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase) repairs toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic O6-alkylguanine (O6-alkG) lesions in DNA by a highly conserved reaction involving the stoichiometric transfer of the alkyl group to the active centre cysteine residue of the ATase protein. Although the human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is very sensitive to inactivation by O6-benzylguanine (BG) or 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (5-nitroso-BP), the equivalent protein formed by the carboxyl terminal domain of the product of the Escherichia coli ada gene (Ada-C) is unaffected by these inhibitors. A mutant of Bacillus subtilis defective in the constitutive activity of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase was isolated from a strain (ada-1) deficient in the adaptive response to DNA alkylation.

The protein O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase(alkyltransferase) is involved in the repair of O 6-alkylguanine and O 4-alkylthymine in DNA and plays an important role in most organisms in attenuating the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of certain classes of alkylating agents. O6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63) repairs O6-alkylguanine lesions in DNA.

571e469bbb137a4b0c00000d	What are the characteristics of Christianson syndrome?	Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6).  We also report prominent neurological, medical, and behavioral symptoms. All CS participants were nonverbal and had intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ataxia. Many had prior diagnoses of autism and/or Angelman syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms included eye movement abnormalities (79%), postnatal microcephaly (92%), and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebellar atrophy (33%). Regression was noted in 50%, with recurrent presentations involving loss of words and/or the ability to walk. Medical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, were common. Height and body mass index measures were below normal ranges in most participants. Behavioral symptoms included hyperkinetic behavior (100%), and a majority exhibited high pain threshold. The single-gene disorders include Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (TCF4), Christianson syndrome (SLC9A6), Mowat–Wilson syndrome (ZEB2), Kleefstra syndrome (EHMT1), and Rett (MECP2) syndrome. Among these are classic disorders such as Angelman syndrome and MECP2-related disorder (formerly Rett syndrome), as well as more recently described clinical entities associated with mutations in CASK, CDKL5, CREBBP, and EP300 (Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome), FOXG1, SLC9A6 (Christianson syndrome), and TCF4 (Pitt-Hopkins syndrome).

Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deleterious mutations in SLC9A6. This X-linked syndrome is characterized by profound mental retardation with autistic behavior, microcephaly, epilepsy, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Mutations in the solute carrier family 9, subfamily A member 6 (SLC9A6) gene, encoding the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) are associated with Christianson syndrome, a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, autistic behavior, early onset seizures and ataxia. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6. The microdeletion/microduplication syndromes are now easily identified by chromosomal microarray analysis and include Phelan–McDermid syndrome (chromosome 22q13.3 deletion), MBD5 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 2q23.1 deletion), and KANSL1 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 17q21.31 deletion).

Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deleterious mutations in SLC9A6. Affected families organized the inaugural Christianson Syndrome Association conference to advance CS knowledge and develop questions that may be prioritized in future research. Among these are classic disorders such as Angelman syndrome and MECP2-related disorder (formerly Rett syndrome), as well as more recently described clinical entities associated with mutations in CASK, CDKL5, CREBBP, and EP300 (Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome), FOXG1, SLC9A6 (Christianson syndrome), and TCF4 (Pitt-Hopkins syndrome).

5a7345792dc08e987e000019	Describe mechanism of action of Napabucasin.	Napabucasin (BBI608) is an orally administered small molecule that blocks stem cell activity in cancer cells by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway.   The STAT3 transcription factor inhibitor, BBI608 (Napabucasin), strongly inhibited growth in almost all PDO cultures, suggesting that stemness programing is involved in organoid formation and/or growth.  Diallyl trisulfide and napabucasin inhibit the signaling by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), potentially enhancing immune function by effects on T helper lymphocytes and promotion of apoptosis.  A small molecule, napabucasin (BBI608), recently have been identified with suppression of stemness-high cancer cells in a variety of cancers.

Mondor's disease is a rare benign and self-limiting condition characterized by thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the anterolateral thoracoabdominal wall. Mondor's disease is a rare condition characterized by a superficial thrombophlebitis that can occur in the thoracoabdominal and genital areas.  CONCLUSION: Penile Mondor disease is a rare complication that can be successfully treated with medical therapy and conservative approach. Our series showed that penile Mondor's disease does not lead to permanent deformation of the penis or erectile dysfunction. Thrombophlebitis of the thoracoepigastric system of veins is a benign disease and, despite its localized involvement and presentation, the condition is known as Mondor disease (MD). Though penile Mondor's disease involving the dorsal vein of the penis has been reported by many authors, we report a peculiar case of penile Mondor's disease in a 26-year-old sexually active man with thrombophlebitis of the circumflex vein of the penis with sparing of the dorsal vein. Mondor's disease of the penis is an uncommon condition, which usually involves the superficial dorsal veins, it was first described by Braun-Falco in 1955. Penile Mondor's disease is rare disease that's characterized by thrombosis in the dorsal vein of the penis.

Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a disease of the central nervous system causing hemorrhage-prone multiple lumen vascular malformations and very severe neurological consequences Cerebral cavernous malformations (CMs) are vascular malformations of the central nervous system, which can be detected in the absence of any clinical symptoms. Nodules and cysts with mixed signal intensity and a peripheral hemosiderin rim are considered brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings typical of CMs Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are enlarged vascular lesions affecting 0.1-0.5% of the population worldwide and causing hemorrhagic strokes, seizures, and neurological deficits Although most cerebral cavernous malformations showed evolution of hemorrhage or no change in size or shape on follow-up MR images, cerebral cavernous malformations represented as mixture of subacute and chronic hemorrhage with hemosiderin rim (type II) have a higher frequency to rebleed than other types of cerebral cavernous malformations. Mutations in Krev1 interaction trapped gene 1 (KRIT1) cause cerebral cavernous malformation, an autosomal dominant disease featuring malformation of cerebral capillaries resulting in cerebral hemorrhage, strokes, and seizures. Cerebral cavernous malformation is a vascular disease of the brain causing headaches, seizures, and cerebral hemorrhage.

Cerebral cavernous malformations represented as hemosiderin deposition without central core (type IV) have a lower tendency to rebleed than other types and do not need any treatment. Adverse reaction of irradiation was observed in five of 22 patients treated with gamma knife surgery. Although most cerebral cavernous malformations showed evolution of hemorrhage or no change in size or shape on follow-up MR images, cerebral cavernous malformations represented as mixture of subacute and chronic hemorrhage with hemosiderin rim (type II) have a higher frequency to rebleed than other types of cerebral cavernous malformations. Cerebral cavernous malformations often remain clinically silent until a mutation carrier suffers a stroke or seizure. Presymptomatic genetic testing has been valuable to follow and manage cerebral cavernous malformation mutation carriers.

54e1c5d5ae9738404b00000b	What is the association between proBNP serum concentrations and stroke outcomes?	N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide levels as a predictor of functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. There was a strong positive correlation between the plasma level of NT-proBNP and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (r=0.415, P=0.000). Plasma levels of NT-proBNP in patients with an unfavorable outcome were significantly higher than those in patients with a favorable outcome [3432 (interquartile range, 1100-54991) vs. 978 (interquartile range, 123-1705) pg/ml; P=0.000]. In multivariate analyses, after adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, the NT-proBNP level that remained can be seen as an independent unfavorable outcome predictor, with an adjusted odds ratios of 4.14 (95% confidence interval, 2.72-7.99; P=0.000). Our results show that plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome and might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for the assessment of functional outcomes in patients with AIS. Plasma levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin were associated with stroke severity, as well as short-term functional outcomes. After adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin remained as independent outcome predictors. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the biomarker panel (including BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin) predicted functional outcome and death within 90 days significantly more efficiently than the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the biomarker alone. The NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher at 4 intervals after ischemic stroke than in healthy and at-risk control subjects (all p<0.001).  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and NIH Stroke Scale were the 2 strongest independent predictors of increased NT-proBNP levels (all p<0.01). Furthermore, increased NT-proBNP (> or = 150 pg/ml) was the strongest independent predictor of long-term (mean follow-up: 24 months) UFCO (26 patients) (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The NT-proBNP level was markedly elevated after acute ischemic stroke and declined substantially thereafter. An increased NT-proBNP level was strongly and independently correlated with UFCO in patients after ischemic stroke.	['ProBNP serum concentrations are elevated in stroke patients relative to healthy controls. Greater proBNP serum concentrations are associated with greater stroke severity and with increased risk for unfvorable functional outcomes.']

58ea521d3e8b6dc87c00000f	What is the link between TB (Turbeculosis) infection and TNFa inhibition?	The use of TNFalpha blockers is associated with reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) We present two patients with inflammatory bowel disease who, despite negative tuberculosis screening, developed a de novo tuberculosis infection after the start of anti tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment. To compare the performance of two interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and conventional screening tests in patients with inflammatory arthritis undergoing screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) compounds. The occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs (ISD) is an old problem that has been highlighted by cases occurring in patients using anti-TNFalpha drugs. TNFalpha plays a pivotal role not only in the inflammatory process but also in the normal response against pathogens and therefore, interfering with this cytokine may increase the risk of infection.

First, forced expression of full-length SUV39H1 (412 amino acids) redistributes endogenous M31 (HP1beta) and induces abundant associations with inter- and metaphase chromatin Together, our data reveal a dominant role(s) for the SET domain of SUV39H1 in the distribution of prominent heterochromatic proteins and suggest a possible link between a chromosomal SU(VAR) protein and histone H3 Using this motif, termed chromo box, we have cloned a mouse candidate modifier gene, M31, that also shows considerable sequence homology to Drosophila HP1 Here we report evidence of at least four independently segregating loci in the mouse homologous to the M31 cDNA. One of these loci--Cbx-rs1--maps to the X Chromosome (Chr), 1 cM proximal to Amg and outside the X-inactivation center region Although there is significant heterochromatic overlap between SUV39H1 and M31 (HP1(beta)) during interphase, mitotic SUV39H1 displays a more restricted spatial and temporal association pattern with metaphase chromosomes than M31 (HP1(beta)), or the related HP1(&agr;) gene product which complex with the heterochromatin component M31. In addition, Suv39h1/SUV39H1 proteins associate with M31, currently the only other characterized mammalian SU(VAR) homologue M31, a murine homolog of Drosophila HP1, is concentrated in the XY body during spermatogenesis The HP1 class of chromobox genes are thought to encode proteins involved in the packaging of chromosomal DNA into repressive heterochromatin domains, as seen, for example, in position-effect variegation Study of the distribution of a murine HP1-like chromodomain protein, M31, during spermatogenesis revealed spreading from the tip of the XY body in mid-stage pachytene spermatocytes to include the whole of the XY body in late-pachytene spermatocytes We also demonstrate that the formation of the XY body during spermatogenic progression in neonatal mice coincides with the expression of a novel nuclear isoform of M31, M31(p21 Furthermore, by overexpressing a mammalian homologue (M31) of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1; refs 7,8) in transgenic mouse lines that exhibit PEV, it is possible to modify the proportion of cells that silence the transgene in a dose-dependent manner Thus, we show M31 overexpression to have two contrasting effects which are dependent on chromosomal context: (i) it enhanced PEV in those lines with centromeric or pericentromeric transgene locations; and (ii) it suppressed PEV when the transgene was non-centromeric	['M31 is a heterochromatin component, that is concentrated in the XY body during spermatogenesis.

This resource includes deletions of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and other annotated ncRNAs as well as the more recently identified stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) whose functions are largely unknown There is extensive transcription throughout the eukaryotic genome resulting in both antisense transcripts from coding regions and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) from intergenic regions These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome.  It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts. These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs) One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters  The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters.  Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). CUTs are often considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression Regulatory mechanisms involving expression of a CUT are diverse and include attenuation, transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice It is well established that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed producing cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are a largely unexplored class of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding RNAs in budding yeast. It is highly debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome.  By identifying configurations of gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3' nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT expression.  Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based regulation of gene expression. Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.

5a75eb6483b0d9ea66000004	What is Blount's disease?	Guided growth for tibia vara (Blount's disease). Blount's disease is commonly attributed to an intrinsic, idiopathic defect in the posteromedial proximal tibial physis resulting in progressive bowing of the leg, intoeing, and lateral knee thrust. Blount's disease is an uncommon disorder of postero-medial proximal tibial physis. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis.  Infantile Blount's disease is a condition that causes genu varum and internal tibial torsion. Blount's disease, or tibia vara, is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents.  In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount's Disease).  Late-onset tibia vara or Blount's disease is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents. PURPOSE: Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy is a useful option for correcting deformity associated with Blount's disease (tibia vara). INTRODUCTION: In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease. BACKGROUND: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities.  In 1937 Blount described a series of 28 patients with 'Tibia vara'. Since then, a number of deformities in the tibia and the femur have been described in association with this condition.  A LSG was done in a 10-year-old boy, body mass index (BMI) 42, who has Blount's disease (tibia vara) with severe pain at the knee joints that made him a wheelchair-bound person.  A review of the English literature on Blount disease (osteochondrosis deformans tibiae; tibia vara) revealed that two forms of the disease, infantile and adolescent, are recognized. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount disease can be defined as idiopathic proximal tibial vara. BACKGROUND Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount's disease or congenital tibia vara is a clinical entity characterized by tibia bowing, tibia torsion, and beaking of the medial tibia metaphysis on plain radiograph. In view of the spontaneous recovery of all investigated patients, it must be doubted whether a diagnosis of infantile tibia vara can be made in early infancy, and whether infantile Blount's disease is a diagnosis in its own right. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis. INTRODUCTION In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease. A family is described with infantile Blount's disease (tibia vara) following an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Biochemical observations in Blount's disease (infantile tibia vara).

5c978924ecadf2e73f000023	What is Quorum Sensing in bacteria?	Many Proteobacteria synthesize acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules for use as signals in cell density-dependent gene regulation known as quorum sensing (QS) and response. In most bacteria, a global level of regulation, termed quorum sensing (QS), exists involving intercellular communication via the production and response to cell density-dependent signal molecules.   In many pathogenic microorganisms, communication systems, collectively termed quorum sensing (QS), have been observed to control a number of bacterial behaviours including expression of virulence factors and the development of biofilms.  Bacteria can communicate within their own species (intra-species) but also between species (inter-species), for which they employ an autoinducer-2 quorum sensing system which is called the universal language of the bacteria. Quorum sensing is a signaling mechanism through which bacteria modulate a number of cellular functions (genes), including sporulation, biofilm formation, bacteriocin production, virulence responses, as well as others. Quorum sensing is a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication and is mediated by extracellular chemical signals generated by the bacteria when specific cell densities are reached. Quorum sensing is used by a large variety of bacteria to regulate gene expression in a cell-density-dependent manner. BACKGROUND Quorum sensing or the bacterial information flow in an orchestrated manner is an essential feature of many pathogenic bacteria. Quorum sensing is the means of communication between these bacteria to regulate a wide range of behavior patterns among them. Quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to share information about cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. Quorum sensing is the phenomenon, whereby bacteria use signal molecules to communicate with each other. The term 'quorum sensing' describes intercellular bacterial communication which regulates bacterial gene expression according to population cell density.

XDG activity is attributable to MUG xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity in E. coli The wild type MUG possesses more robust activity against xanthine than uracil and is active against all xanthine-containing DNA The gene for the mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) was identified in the Escherichia coli genome as a sequence homolog of the human thymine DNA glycosylase with activity against mismatched uracil base pairs.

One member of the uracil-DNA glycosylase family of repair enzymes, Escherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (Mug), is reported to distinguish U:G mispairs from U:A base pairs based upon specific contacts with the mispaired guanine after flipping the target uracil out of the duplex. T transition in the ung mug double mutant as compared to the single ung mutant suggest that MUG may be a back-up repair enzyme to the classic uracil-DNA glycosylase. The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U.G mismatches (Gallinari, P., and Jiricny, J. (1996) Nature 383, 735-738) and is named mismatched uracil glycosylase (Mug). Because uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) and Vsr are known to repair U.G and T.G mismatches, respectively, we conclude that Mug does not repair U.G or T.G mismatches in vivo.

60266cf31cb411341a0000c4	What is the mechanism of action of satralizumab?	Satralizumab (Enspryng®), a humanized anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal recycling antibody, has been developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical and Roche for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).  Monoclonal antibodies targeting terminal complement (eculizumab), CD19 (inebilizumab), and the interleukin-6 receptor (satralizumab) have demonstrated efficacy in NMOSD attack prevention in recent phase 3 trials and have gained subsequent regulatory approval in the USA and other countries.  Two of these, the antiinterleukin 6 (IL-6) agents tocilizumab and satralizumab, have been studied in active NMOSD.O The interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor satralizumab and anti-CD19 antibody inebilizumab have published positive phase III trial results and await approval in the near future. Clinical trials of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients showed success with eculizumab (preventing cleavage of complement factor C5, thereby blocking formation of chemotactic C5a and membrane attack complex C9neo), inebilizumab (depleting CD19 + B cells), and satralizumab (anti-IL-6R blocking IL-6 actions). Introduction: Recent research has shown that IL-6 receptor (IL-6 R) inhibitors like tocilizumab and satralizumab are effective in reducing the relapse rate in patients with NMOSD. SION: In NMOSD patients with antibodies against aquaporin 4, monoclonal antibodies that deplete B cells (rituximab and inebilizumab) or interfere with interleukin 6 signaling (tocilizumab and satralizumab) or complement activation (eculizumab) have superior efficacy compared to placebo. Tocil  now have three agents indicated for the treatment of NMO including (eculizumab [Soliris®]), an anti-C5 complement inhibitor, satralizumab (ENSRYNG®), a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) that blocks B cell antibody production and inebilizumab (Uplinza®), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the B-cell surface antigen CD19 with subsequent B and plasmablast cell lymphocytolysis with decreasing antibody production.

54fc97b86ad7dcbc12000002	What is known about clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?	Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Ceftriaxone delays loss of neurons in genetic animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through upregulation of astrocytic glutamate transporter expression (GLT-1). OBJECTIVES: Ceftriaxone increases expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, EAAT2, which might protect from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.  Thirty-four compounds (including riluzole, ceftriaxone, minocyclin, PBA, lithium, acetylcysteine) in human and mouse ALS trials and an additional set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds also showed no effect on SOD1 promoter activity.  Two of these patients received ceftriaxone for 1 month without clinical improvement. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, down-regulation of the astrocyte-specific glutamate excitatory amino acid transporter 2 is hypothesized to increase extracellular glutamate, thereby leading to excitotoxic motor neuron death. The antibiotic ceftriaxone was recently reported to induce excitatory amino acid transporter 2 and to prolong the survival of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 transgenic mice. OBJECTIVE: Ceftriaxone has been reported to reduce neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in an in-vitro model of neuronal ischaemia through increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter, GLT1.  Dysfunction of EAAT2 is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated dementia, and growth of malignant gliomas. Ceftriaxone, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is a stimulator of EAAT2 expression with neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models based in part on its ability to inhibit neuronal cell death by glutamate excitotoxicity.  Motor neuron disease recovery associated with IV ceftriaxone and anti-Babesia therapy. This report summarizes what we believe to be the first verifiable case of a significant and progressive motor neuron disease (MND) consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that resolved during treatment with i.v. ceftriaxone plus oral atovaquone and mefloquine. Other agents (ceftriaxone, minocycline, ONO-2506, and IGF-1 polypeptide) are already in phase III trials involving large numbers of patients with ALS. Ongoing trials are exploring the value of antiglutamatergic agents, including the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone, as well as antioxidants, mitochondrial enhancers and anti-apoptotic drugs.  Recently, Rothstein et al. reported that beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and ceftriaxone, are potential therapeutic drugs to treat some neurological disorders, e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by modulating the expression of glutamate transporter GLT1 via gene activation.  Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity. When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival.  We describe two patients with lateral amyotrophic sclerosis who, after informed consent, received empirical treatment with intravenous cephtriaxone at a dose of 2 g/24 hours for three weeks, with no positive results. Despite promising stage 2 data, stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy.  Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone was evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	['There have been a few case reports to suggest that ceftriaxone can be effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, other case reports did not report clinical benefit of ceftriaxone therapy for ALS.

Clinical trials investigating potential clinical benefits of ceftriaxone in ALS are ongoing.']
5a89528dfcd1d6a10c000001	Where do centromeres locate according to the Rabl orientation of eukaryotic nuclei?	This was taken as good evidence for the maintenance of the chromosome arrangement - the Rabl orientation - and of the peripheral location of the centromere and its association with the nuclear membrane. Within this general arrangement homologous telocentric chromosomes were frequently seen to have their centromeres associated or directed towards each other. The role of the centromere in somatic association as a spindle fibre attachment and chromosome binder is discussed. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear membrane  telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. We suggest that centromeric and other highly repeated non-transcribed sequence domains may act as general organizing centers for cell type specific interphase patterns that are conserved in mammalian evolution.  Centromere clustering is a major determinant of yeast interphase nuclear organization During interphase in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are clustered near one pole of the nucleus as a rosette with the spindle pole body at its hub. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres.  We show that most of this preferential association is not due to vegetative (also known as somatic) pairing but is caused by the polar orientation of interphase chromosomes (Rabl orientation) These developments are discussed in this contribution, with particular reference to the centromere and the nucleolus organizer. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres. chromosomes are not packed randomly in the nucleus the rabl orientation is an example of the non random arrangement of chromosomes centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres this orientation is established during mitosis and maintained through subsequent interphase in a range of species we report that a rabl like configuration can be formed de novo without a preceding mitosis during the transition from the sexual phase to the vegetative phase of the life cycle in fission yeast in this process each of the dispersed centromeres is often associated with a novel sad1 containing body that is contacting a cytoplasmic microtubule laterally sad1 is a component of the spindle pole body spb the sad1 containing body was colocalized with other known spb components kms1 and spo15 but not with cut12 indicating that it represents a novel spb related complex the existence of the triplex structure centromere microtubule sad1 body suggests that the clustering of centromeres is controlled by a cytoplasmic microtubular system accordingly when microtubules are destabilized clustering is markedly reduced.

However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.

52f385052059c6d71c000011	what is the role of IGF-1 in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?	In conclusion, ischemia-reperfusion injury was the strongest stimulus with both global and focal cardiomyocyte progenitor cell marker up-regulations, correlating to the endogenous up-regulation of the growth factors IGF-1 and HGF. Also pregnancy induced a general up-regulation of c-Kit and early Nkx2.5+ cardiomyocytes throughout the heart. Utilization of these pathways could provide new strategies for the treatment of cardiac disease. Together, our data demonstrate that the paracrine regulation of cardiac miRNAs by transplanted BMCs contributes to the protective effects of cell therapy. BMCs release IGF-1, which inhibits the processing of miR-34a, thereby blocking cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In an animal model of AMI relevant to the human disease, intracoronary administration of IGF-1/HGF is a practical and effective strategy to reduce pathological cardiac remodeling, induce myocardial regeneration, and improve ventricular function. hCSCs expressing only IGF-1R synthesize both IGF-1 and IGF-2, which are potent modulators of stem cell replication, commitment to the myocyte lineage, and myocyte differentiation, which points to this hCSC subset as the ideal candidate cell for the management of human heart failure. In physiologic conditions, cardiac overexpression of the IGF-1Ea propeptide is associated with an enrichment of c-Kit/Sca-1 positive side population cells in the bone marrow and the occurrence of an endothelial-primed CD34 positive side population in the heart. This cellular profile is shown here to correlate with the expression of cytokines involved in stem cell mobilization and vessel formation. This molecular and cellular interplay favored IGF-1Ea-mediated vessel formation in injured hearts.  Furthermore, this treatment prevented cell apoptosis, induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and increased the incidence of GATA-4-positive cell clusters. The dual delivery of IGF-1 and HGF from affinity-binding alginate biomaterial represents a useful strategy to treat MI. It showed a marked therapeutic efficacy at various tissue levels, as well as potential to induce endogenous regeneration of cardiac muscle. Finally, neuregulins and periostin are proteins that induce cell-cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes, and growth factors like IGF-1 can induce growth and differentiation of stem cells.  The addition of nanofiber-mediated IGF-1 delivery to CPC therapy improved in part the recovery of myocardial structure and function after infarction. In conclusion, the strategy of IGF-1 transgene expression induced massive stem cell mobilization via SDF-1alpha signaling and culminated in extensive angiomyogenesis in the infarcted heart. We tested whether cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) implanted in proximity of healed infarcts or resident CPCs stimulated locally by hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 invade the scarred myocardium and generate myocytes and coronary vessels improving the hemodynamics of the infarcted heart. Hepatocyte growth factor is a powerful chemoattractant of CPCs, and insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes their proliferation and survival.  Alternatively, growth factors may be delivered locally to stimulate resident CPCs and promote myocardial regeneration.  supplemental mIGF-1 expression did not perturb normal cardiac growth and physiology. Restoration of cardiac function in post-infarct mIGF-1 transgenic mice was facilitated by modulation of the inflammatory response and increased antiapoptotic signaling. mIGF-1 ventricular tissue exhibited increased proliferative activity several weeks after injury.  Cardiac stem cells and early committed cells (CSCs-ECCs) express c-Met and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors and synthesize and secrete the corresponding ligands, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and IGF-1. HGF mobilizes CSCs-ECCs and IGF-1 promotes their survival and proliferation.  After infarction, HGF and IGF-1 were injected intramyocardially to stimulate resident cardiac progenitor cells.  These results suggest that strategies capable of activating the growth reserve of the myocardium may be important in cardiac repair after ischemic injury. In conclusion, constitutive overexpression of IGF-1 prevented activation of cell death in the viable myocardium after infarction, limiting ventricular dilation, myocardial loading, and cardiac hypertrophy.

5148a2f6d24251bc05000035	What pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can be considered as prophylactic therapies in Cluster Headache patients?	The calcium channel blocker verapamil is the drug of choice for CH prevention. Other drugs that may be used for this purpose include lithium carbonate, topiramate, valproic acid, gabapentin, and baclofen. Recently, the therapeutic options for refractory CH patients have expanded with the emergence of both peripheral (mostly occipital nerve) and central (hypothalamic) neurostimulation. With the emergence of these novel treatments, the role of ablative surgery in CH has declined. The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil. Yet, other medications, including lithium, divalproex sodium, topiramate, methysergide, gabapentin, and even indomethacin, may be useful when the headache fails to respond to verapamil. For medically refractory patients, surgical interventions, occipital nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain an option. The objective of this open single-centre study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) as add-on in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache (CH). These findings provide evidence that BTX-A may be beneficial as an add-on prophylactic therapy for a limited number of patients with chronic CH. There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine. Most procedures are directed against the sensory trigeminal nerve and associated ganglia, eg, anesthetizing the sphenopalatine ganglion. The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil. Lithium, divalproex sodium, or topiramate may also be useful. Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis. Topiramate also appears to be well tolerated and useful in the adjunctive treatment of cluster headache. The cornerstone of maintenance prophylaxis is verapamil, yet methysergide, lithium, and divalproex sodium may also be employed. In some patients, melatonin or topiramate may be useful adjunctive therapies. Prophylactic therapy in most cases consisted of verapamil, also with a good response. Patients with chronic cluster headache may achieve good results from long-term treatment with other therapies, including lithium carbonate, verapamil, and ketoprofen.

55031181e9bde69634000014	Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes In this study, we review the identification of genes and loci involved in the non-syndromic common form and syndromic Mendelian forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model Coding sequence mutations in e.g. RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) as well as syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR). Furthermore, mutations in the RET gene are responsible for approximately half of the familial and some sporadic cases, strongly suggesting, on the one hand, the importance of non-coding variations and, on the other hand, that additional genes involved in the development of the enteric nervous system still await their discovery For almost all of the identified HSCR genes incomplete penetrance of the HSCR phenotype has been reported, probably due to modifier loci. Therefore, HSCR has become a model for a complex oligo-/polygenic disorder in which the relationship between different genes creating a non-mendelian inheritance pattern still remains to be elucidated  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes.  The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes. Differential contributions of rare and common, coding and noncoding Ret mutations to multifactorial Hirschsprung disease liability. BACKGROUND: RET is the major gene associated to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology. In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance. Chromosomal and related Mendelian syndromes associated with Hirschsprung's disease. The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model	["Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease.

Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, ameliorates motor deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors, we have conducted preclinical trials with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, in the R6/2 HD mouse model. We show that SAHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases histone acetylation in the brain SAHA dramatically improved the motor impairment in R6/2 mice, clearly validating the pursuit of this class of compounds as HD therapeutics.

5319a83bb166e2b80600002c	What is the use of emulsion PCR in Next Generation Sequencing?	Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing. The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors. Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. In our NGS approach, the 16,569-bp mtDNA is enriched by long-range PCR and the 108 nuclear genes (which represent 1301 amplicons and 680 kb) are enriched by RainDance emulsion PCR. Sequencing is performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or MiSeq platforms, and bioinformatics analysis is performed using commercial and in-house developed bioinformatics pipelines. However, pyrosequencing of emulsion PCR reactions, amplifying from only one molecule at a time, can generate megabases of clonally amplified loci at high coverage, thereby greatly simplifying allelic sequence determination. During genomic PCR, in this 4-primer system, the outer set of primers containing the MID and the 454 adaptor sequences are incorporated into an amplicon generated by the inner HLA target-specific primers each containing a common sequence tag at the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Pools of the resulting amplicons are used for emulsion PCR and clonal sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX System, followed by genotyping with Conexio software. The purpose of our study was to compare NGS enrichment methods for a clinical assay targeting the nine genes known to be associated with aortopathy. RainDance emulsion PCR and SureSelect RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment methods were directly compared by enriching DNA from eight samples. We show the efficacy by comparing the method to a commercial kit and further demonstrate that emulsion PCR can be used for bias free amplification and virtual immortalization of DNA template libraries. Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR. Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads. The protocol is simple and provides an even sequence distribution of multiplex libraries when sequencing the flow-sorted beads. Moreover, since many empty and mixed emulsion PCR beads are removed, the approach gives rise to a substantial increase in sequence quality and mean read length, as compared to that obtained by standard enrichment protocols. Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX. Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads. The library samples were loaded to sequencing Chip for Work Flow Analysis (WFA) or sequencing running with default parameters.

55074fa8bde8548216000003	What is the definition and the biological role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process known to contribute to metastasis in cancer and it is mainly characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression. The TGF-β signaling pathway has an established role in promoting EMT by down-regulating E-cadherin via a number of transcription factors, such as Twist, Snail and Slug. EMT has also been reported to produce cells with stem cell-like properties.  Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which cells change phenotype during carcinogenesis, as well as tumor metastasis.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process in which epithelial cells acquire the characteristics of invasive mesenchymal cells. EMT has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis as well as the formation of many tissues and organs during development. Epithelial cells undergoing EMT lose cell-cell adhesion structures and polarity, and rearrange their cytoskeletons. Several oncogenic pathways such as transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways, have been shown to induce EMT. These pathways have activated transcription factors including Snail, Slug, and the ZEB family which work as transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, thereby making epithelial cells motile and resistant to apoptosis.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is suggested to be crucial for the development of an invasive and metastatic carcinoma cell phenotype. Therefore, the definition of this phenotype is of great clinical interest.  Recent work has suggested that there may be a linkage between the stem cell phenotype and that induced by the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT plays an important role in cell movement and organ formation during embryogenesis, and it is currently hypothesized to be a major mechanism by which epithelial cancers may generate cells that can form metastases.  The term EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) is used in many settings. This term is used to describe the mechanisms facilitating cellular repositioning and redeployment during embryonic development and tissue reconstruction after injury. Recently, EMT has also been applied to potential mechanisms for malignant progression and has appeared as a specific diagnostic category of tumors. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. This process is also reactivated in a variety of diseases including fibrosis and in the progression of carcinoma. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in many biological processes. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process that drives polarized, immotile epithelial cells to undergo multiple biochemical changes to acquire a mesenchymal cell phenotype.

Long-term survival of participants in the CENTAUR trial of sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An orally administered, fixed-dose coformulation of sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (PB-TURSO) significantly slowed functional decline in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in ALS (CENTAUR).  Initiation of PB-TURSO treatment at baseline resulted in a 6.5-month longer median survival as compared with placebo. Combined with results from CENTAUR, these results suggest that PB-TURSO has both functional and survival benefits in ALS. Trial of Sodium Phenylbutyrate-Taurursodiol for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we enrolled participants with definite ALS who had had an onset of symptoms within the previous 18 months. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (3 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and 1 g of taurursodiol, administered once a day for 3 weeks and then twice a day) or placebo.  CONCLUSIONS: Sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol resulted in slower functional decline than placebo as measured by the ALSFRS-R score over a period of 24 weeks.

56c2fbd91e69116444000001	What is the role of ELMO1 gene in cell migration?	Elmo1 helps dock180 to regulate Rac1 activity and cell migration of ovarian cancer Engulfment and cell motility 1 (Elmo1) has been reported to cooperate with dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180) and to be linked to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells through activating small G-protein Rac Engulfment and cell motility 1 presents with synergetic action in helping Dock180 to activate Rac1 and promote cell motility, and thus promote untoward expansion and aggressiveness of SOC. Elmo1 and Elmo2 are highly homologous cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that interact with Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors to promote activation of the small GTPase Rac This work provides valuable insights into the molecular regulation of Dock2 by Elmo1 that can be used to design improved inhibitors that target the Elmo-Dock-Rac signaling complex Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes Here we show that CXCL12 stimulation promotes interaction between Gαi2 and ELMO1. Gi signalling and ELMO1 are both required for CXCL12-mediated actin polymerization, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. CXCL12 triggers a Gαi2-dependent membrane translocation of ELMO1, which associates with Dock180 to activate small G-proteins Rac1 and Rac2. Our findings indicate that a chemokine-controlled pathway, consisting of Gαi2, ELMO1/Dock180, Rac1 and Rac2, regulates the actin cytoskeleton during breast cancer metastasis. These findings suggest that clearance of apoptotic cells in living vertebrates is accomplished by the combined actions of apoptotic cell migration and elmo1-dependent macrophage engulfment. Mechanistically, we identified Netrin-1 and its receptor Unc5B as upstream activators of the ELMO1/DOCK180 complex, regulating its functional interaction and leading to Rac1 activation in endothelial cells and vessel formation in zebrafish The ELMO1/DOCK180 complex forms a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, regulating its activation during cell migration in different biological systems. ELMO proteins are also known to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization through activation of the small GTPbinding protein Rac via the ELMO-Dock180 complex. Finally, in contrast to most other ERM-binding proteins, ELMO1 binding occurred independently of the state of radixin C-terminal phosphorylation, suggesting an ELMO1 interaction with both the active and inactive forms of ERM proteins and implying a possible role of ELMO in localizing or retaining ERM proteins in certain cellular sites. Together these data suggest that ELMO1-mediated cytoskeletal changes may be coordinated with ERM protein crosslinking activity during dynamic cellular functions. In mammalian fibroblasts, ELMO1 binds to Dock180, and functions upstream of Rac during phagocytosis and cell migration. We previously showed that ELMO1 binds directly to the Hck SH3 domain and is phosphorylated by Hck. The data suggest that Src family kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 might represent an important regulatory mechanism that controls signaling through the ELMO1/Crk/Dock180 pathway. We also found that ELMO1 regulated multiple Dock180 superfamily members to promote migration. This finding suggests that Rac activation by the ELMO.Dock180 complex at discrete intracellular locations mediated by the N-terminal 330 amino acids of ELMO1 rather than generalized Rac activation plays a role in cell migration In mammalian cells, ELMO1 interacts with Dock180 as a component of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac pathway responsible for phagocytosis and cell migration. The binding of ELMO1 to Hck is specifically dependent on the interaction of a polyproline motif with the SH3 domain of Hck. Our results suggest that these proteins may be novel activators/effectors of Hck. We also show that Hck and ELMO1 interact in intact cells and that ELMO1 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells that co-express Hck, suggesting that it is a substrate of Hck these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes Essential role of Elmo1 in Dock2-dependent lymphocyte migration.

The diagnosis of idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion used for children with persistent toe walking and no associated medical condition .  Idiopathic toe-walking is a diagnosis of exclusion when a child presents with bilateral toe-to-toe gait. BACKGROUND: Idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by a persistent toe-toe gait pattern after three years of age. Idiopathic toe walking (ITW), considered abnormal after the age of 3 years, is a common complaint seen by medical professionals, especially orthopaedic surgeons and physiotherapists. Idiopathic toe-walking is defined as persistent toe-walking in a normal child in the absence of developmental, neurological or neuromuscular conditions.	['Idiopathic toe walking is a pathological gait pattern in which children older than 3 years walk on their tip toes with no contact between the heels and the ground.']

We also show that the deletion of Histone-Acetyltransferase genes reduce the silencing activity of an ACS proto-silencer, but also reduce the anti-silencing activity of a STAR.  The telomere-proximal portion of either X or Y' dampened silencing when located between the telomere and the reporter gene. These elements were named STARs, for subtelomeric anti-silencing regions. STARs can also counteract silencer-driven repression at the mating-type HML locus. When two STARs bracket a reporter gene, its expression is no longer influenced by surrounding silencing elements, although these are still active on a second reporter gene. In addition, an intervening STAR uncouples the silencing of neighboring genes. STARs thus display the hallmarks of insulators. Thus the STAR and TEF2-UASrpg boundary elements inhibit chromatin silencing through an antisilencing activity independently of their position or orientation in S. cerevisiae minichromosomes rather than by creating a position-specific barrier as seen in the genome.

Antidepressants were prescribed by the psychiatrist that not only cured the depression with time but also the bleeding episodes which were actually related to child's depression (Gardner-Diamond syndrome or psychogenic purpura).  Psychogenic Purpura (Gardner-Diamond Syndrome). Psychogenic purpura, also known as Gardner-Diamond syndrome or autoerythrocyte sensitization syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by spontaneous development of painful edematous skin lesions progressing to ecchymosis over the next 24 hours. Severe stress and emotional trauma always precede the skin lesions.  Gardner Diamond syndrome is a rare condition characterized with painful ecchymoses in different parts of the body and cutaneous and mucosal hemorrhages. The etiology is not known fully and psychogenic factors are thought to be involved.  Psychogenic purpura, also known as Gardner-Diamond syndrome, is a rare, distinctive, localized cutaneous reaction pattern mostly affecting psychologically disturbed adult women. Repeated crops of tender, ill-defined ecchymotic lesions on the extremities and external bleeding from other sites characterize the condition.  PPDDM includes impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, factitious disorder, factitious disorder by proxy, self-mutilation, delusions of parasitosis, psychogenic purpura/Gardner-Diamond syndrome, and cutaneous sensory disorders. Psychogenic purpura (Gardner-Diamond syndrome) is the occurrence and spontaneous recurrence of painful ecchymosis following emotional stress and minor trauma.

56f82f9acf1c325851000002	What is the minimal genome build?	As a key focus of synthetic biology, building a minimal artificial cell has given rise to many discussions. A synthetic minimal cell will provide an appropriate chassis to integrate functional synthetic parts, devices and systems with functions that cannot generally be found in nature. The design and construction of a functional minimal genome is a key step while building such a cell/chassis since all the cell functions can be traced back to the genome.  The field of Synthetic Biology seeks to apply engineering principles to biology in order to produce novel biological systems. One approach to accomplish this goal is the genome-driven cell engineering approach, which searches for functioning minimal genomes in naturally occurring microorganisms, which can then be used as a template for future systems. Currently a prototypical minimal genome has not been discovered.  The identification of the essential genes of bacteria and the minimal genome for the free-living cellular life could provide insights into the origin, evolution, and essence of life forms.  Minimal bacterial gene set comprises the genetic elements needed for survival of engineered bacterium on a rich medium. This set is estimated to include 300-350 protein-coding genes. One way of simplifying an organism with such a minimal genome even further is to constrain the amino acid content of its proteins.  A central undertaking in synthetic biology (SB) is the quest for the 'minimal genome'. However, 'minimal sets' of essential genes are strongly context-dependent and, in all prokaryotic genomes sequenced to date, not a single protein-coding gene is entirely conserved. Furthermore, a lack of consensus in the field as to what attributes make a gene truly essential adds another aspect of variation. Thus, a universal minimal genome remains elusive. The minimal cell concept represents a pragmatic approach to the question of how few genes are required to run a cell. This is a helpful way to build a parts-list, and has been more successful than attempts to deduce a minimal gene set for life by inferring the gene repertoire of the last universal common ancestor, as few genes trace back to this hypothetical ancestral state.

5c66329e7c78d6947100000f	What is the mechanism of action of durvalumab?	In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the godfather of checkpoint inhibitors, whereas several blocking monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and BMS-946559) have been developed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicities in patients with metastatic UC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies may provide overall survival advantage; these are currently being evaluated in ongoing phase 3 studies.  METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.2). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a key component of treating advanced cancer patients, principally antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a selective, high-affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 and CD80, but not to PD-L2. However, it is still unknown how atezolizumab and durvalumab specifically recognize PD-L1, although this is important for investigating novel binding sites on PD-L1 targeted by other therapeutic antibodies for the design and improvement of anti-PD-L1 agents. Here, we report the crystal structures of PD-L1 in complex with atezolizumab and durvalumab to elucidate the precise epitopes involved and the structural basis for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade by these antibodies. In 2016 and 2017, monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-L1, including atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab, were approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple advanced cancers. We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers. Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab might provide greater antitumour activity than either drug alone. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and CD80, blocking PD-L1, but not PD-L2. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab. Durvalumab is a human IgG1-K monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and locally advanced, unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. Other notable PD-L1 inhibitors under development include avelumab and durvalumab. Combining the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody tremelimumab offers the potential for antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor status. Five antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1--programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1--PD-L1) pathway have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of various malignancies: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab. Currently, the only FDA-approved indication for the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab (MEDI-4736) is locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed during or following platinum-based chemotherapy within 12 months of treatment. Intravenous durvalumab (Imfinzi™; AstraZeneca) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed cell death ligand-1 binding to its receptors (PD-1 and CD80), resulting in enhanced T-cell responses against cancer cells. Here, we report a meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736), an inhibitor of PD-L1, in various solid tumors.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin® [H]) is the standard of care for HER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer and gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.  Breast cancer (BCa) is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) occurs in ~20-25% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas and is associated with the more aggressive phenotype. Herceptin, a humanized antibody against HER2, is a standard therapy in HER2-overexpressing cases. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®), a monoclonal antibody against the ErbB2 (HER2) receptor, has significantly improved clinical outcomes for HER2+ breast cancer patients.

5318a6b2b166e2b80600001f	What clinical use aptamers may have?	In murine tumor models, the aptamer-targeted siRNA-mediated NMD inhibition in tumor cells led to significant inhibition of tumor growth, which was superior to best-in-class "conventional" cancer vaccination protocols. Tumor-targeted NMD inhibition forms the basis of a simple, broadly useful, and clinically feasible approach to enhance the antigenicity of disseminated tumors leading to their immune recognition and rejection. This study is focused on one aptamer (termed A2). Transfection of this molecule into HPV16-transformed cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation (shown using real-time cell electronic sensing and MTT assays) due to the induction of apoptosis (as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining). Transfection of cells with A2 was correlated with the loss of E7 and the induction of apoptosis. Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer (Macugen) is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials. The high binding affinity and specificity of aptamers allows for isolation of an artificial ligand for theoretically any therapeutic target of interest. Aptamers are a special class of nucleic acid molecules that are beginning to be investigated for clinical use. These small RNA/DNA molecules can form secondary and tertiary structures capable of specifically binding proteins or other cellular targets; they are essentially a chemical equivalent of antibodies. Aptamers have the advantage of being highly specific, relatively small in size, and non-immunogenic. In the last two decades, many aptamers have been clinically developed as inhibitors for targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombin. The first aptamer based therapeutic was FDA approved in 2004 for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and several other aptamers are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Preclinical studies using aptamer-siRNA chimeras and aptamer targeted nanoparticle therapeutics have been very successful in mouse models of cancer and HIV. In summary aptamers are in several stages of development, from pre-clinical studies to clinical trials and even as FDA approved therapeutics. In subcutaneous and metastatic tumour models, tumour-targeted delivery of NMD factor-specific siRNAs conjugated to oligonucleotide aptamer ligands led to significant inhibition of tumour growth that was superior to that of vaccination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing irradiated tumour cells, and could be further enhanced by co-stimulation. An assortment of non-viral carriers including liposomes, peptides, polymers, and aptamers are being evaluated for their ability to shepherd siRNA to the target tissue and cross the plasma membrane barrier into the cell. In addition, a new thromboxane receptor antagonist, NCX-4016, a newly discovered protease-activated receptor antagonist that targets thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and anti-von Willebrand factor aptamers show tremendous promise in refining antiplatelet therapy by targeting different receptors and molecules. First-in-human evaluation of anti von Willebrand factor therapeutic aptamer ARC1779 in healthy volunteers ARC1779 is a therapeutic aptamer antagonist of the A1 domain of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), the ligand for receptor glycoprotein 1b on platelets. ARC1779 is being developed as a novel antithrombotic agent for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes. This is the first-in-human evaluation of a novel aptamer antagonist of vWF. ARC1779 produced dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of vWF activity and platelet function with duration of effect suitable for the intended clinical use in acute coronary syndromes. Wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy are pathological consequences of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release as a reaction to deficiency of oxygen and nutrients in the macular cells. FDA recently approved two drugs specifically aimed at VEGF, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and pegaptinib, a pegylated aptamer with application in ophthalmic pathologies. Delivery of double-stranded DNA thioaptamers into HIV-1 infected cells for antiviral activity Our lead thioaptamer, R12-2, targets the RNase H domain of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and inhibits viral infection in U373-MAGI-CCR5 cells. In this report, we demonstrate that monothioate-modified DNA duplex oligonucleotides can be efficiently delivered into cells by liposome-based transfection agents to inhibit HIV replication. Nucleic acid aptamers in therapeutic anticoagulation Pegaptanib sodium for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration Pegaptanib sodium is one of the first therapeutics belonging to the class of compounds known as aptamers.

Regulatable aptamers in medicine: focus on antithrombotic strategies After a decade of intensive research, technology development and initial clinical evaluation, aptamers have now demonstrated broad potential as direct protein ligands and inhibitors, and thus represent an exciting class of compounds for the development of new therapeutic and diagnostic agents.  Two R-aptamers (R10-60 and D-R15-8) with the predominant shared characteristics were selected for further study on primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, which are well known to be difficult to transfect and activate. Together, these findings suggest that the sequence compositions in R-aptamers that promote multimerization and contain optimal ISS CpG motifs facilitate the delivery of ISS-ODN to CLL cells and enhance the activation of these cells. In particular, the use of aptamers for the alleviation of blood clotting and the treatment of AIDS are considered. We synthesized an RNA aptamer probe specific for human CD4 using a reported sequence and investigated the potential use of this probe in cell phenotyping. Studies in cultured cells demonstrated that the synthetic CD4 aptamer had a nearly identical cell-binding specificity as the standard CD4 antibody. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed that the aptamer and antibody generated the same CD4 staining pattern in cells without competing with one another. transfection of HPV16-transformed cells with A2 appeared to result in the loss of E7 and rise in pRb levels	['In the clinic, aptamers may be used to enhance the antigenicity of disseminated tumors, leading to their immune recognition and rejection; to target HPV16 E7 oncoprotein, inhibiting cell proliferation and activating apoptosis of infected cells; to act as inhibitors for targets such as VEGF, in age-related macular degeneration, and thrombin, or von Willebrand factor, in patients with acute coronary syndromes; to target the RNase H domain of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and inhibit viral replication; to transfect and activate B cells in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); or finally, to be used as probes in CD4-cell phenotyping.']

RESULTS: The DA was acceptable to subjects, but 17 % of the patients in the decision aid arm incorrectly entered their T-scores into FRAX-based risk calculator.  Comparing self-perceived and estimated fracture risk by FRAX® of women with osteoporosis. In this study, we compared subjective fracture risks of Hungarian women with osteoporosis to FRAX®-based estimates.  PURPOSE: The main objectives were to explore associations between self-perceived 10-year fracture risks of women with osteoporosis (OP) and their risks calculated by the FRAX® algorithm and to identify determinants of the underestimation of risk. The development of absolute fracture risk (AFR) algorithms, such as FRAX® and the Garvan absolute fracture risk calculator, to predict risk of fracture over a given time (usually 10 years) aims to incorporate non-BMD risk factors into the clinical assessment. FRAX® has been shown to be useful to assess fracture risk in CKD but may underestimate fracture risk in advanced CKD. THE GOAL: was an evaluation of the correlation between 10-year risk of death from CVD and 10-year bone fracture risk (FRAX). OBJECTIVE: To verify the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to estimate the probability of osteoporotic fracture in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with or without bone mineral density (BMD), and identify associated risk factors of osteoporosis. Can paramedics use FRAX (the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) to help GPs improve future fracture risk in patients who fall? Paramedics who attend to patients who have fallen may be well placed to assess future fracture risk, using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and communicate that information directly to general practitioners (GPs). Key changes are revision of the criteria for initiation of pharmaceutical treatment, along with an introduction of the fracture risk factors used in FRAX®, inclusion of newly developed drugs, and revision of the recommendation grades for pharmaceutical treatment of osteoporosis. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) was developed to estimate the risk of fracture in the general population.  FRAX provides 10-year probability of major fractures. The WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX; http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) estimates the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture.  One of the key changes is revision of the criteria for initiation of pharmacological treatment, along with an introduction of the fracture risk factors used in FRAX®.  The principal variable was the likelihood of fracture evaluated with the FRAX® tool for the Spanish population. Application of the WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to predict need for DEXA scanning and treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease at risk of osteoporosis. he FRAX score, developed by the WHO, is a free web-based clinical scale assessing the 10-year fracture risk and need for lifestyle advice/reassurance, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning or preventive treatment. PURPOSE: The WHO fracture risk prediction tool (FRAX®) utilises clinical risk factors to estimate the probability of fracture over a 10-year period.

589afa6978275d0c4a000039	What is Neisseria adhesin A?	Exploiting chimeric human antibodies to characterize a protective epitope of Neisseria adhesin A, one of the Bexsero vaccine components. Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is one of the antigens of Bexsero, the recently licensed multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB). NadA belongs to the class of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and is able to mediate adhesion and invasion of human epithelial cells. As a vaccine antigen, NadA has been shown to induce high levels of bactericidal antibodies A new vaccine (the 4CMenB 4-component protein vaccine [Bexsero], which includes PorA, factor H-binding protein [fHbp], neisserial heparin-binding antigen [NHBA], and Neisseria adhesin A [NadA]) against serogroup B meningococci has recently been approved for use in people older than age 2 months in Europe, Australia, and Canada.  Serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA) was measured against three reference strains 44/76-SL, 5/99 and NZ98/254, selected to express one of the vaccine antigens; Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), factor H binding protein (fHbp) and porin A (PorA) containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV), respectively. Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA). Vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA).  Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada. NadA has been identified in approximately 30% of clinical isolates and in a much lower proportion of carrier isolates. Three protein variants were originally identified in invasive meningococci and named NadA-1, NadA-2, and NadA-3, whereas most carrier isolates either lacked the gene or harbored a different variant, NadA-4. Further analysis of isolates belonging to the sequence type 213 (ST-213) clonal complex identified NadA-5, which was structurally similar to NadA-4, but more distantly related to NadA-1, -2, and -3. At the time of this writing, more than 89 distinct nadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described.  The main features of this new scheme include (i) the grouping of the previously named NadA-2 and NadA-3 variants into a single NadA-2/3 variant, (ii) the grouping of the previously assigned NadA-4 and NadA-5 variants into a single NadA-4/5 variant, (iii) the introduction of an additional variant (NadA-6), and (iv) the classification of the variants into two main groups, named groups I and II.  To broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA).  Nine N. meningitidis isolates (eight MenB and one MenY) were found to possess at least one gene that encoded for an antigen that matched exactly with protein variants in the 4CMenB vaccine. Two MenB expressed PorA antigen P1.4 and possessed the nhba gene for peptide 2; four other MenB were predicted to have NHBA peptide 2; another two MenB were predicted to encode fHbp peptide 1.1; and a single MenY was found to have nadA gene for NadA peptide 8. Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).Of the 263 IMD isolates analysed, 229, 16, 10, 7, and 1 belonged to MenB, MenY, MenW, MenC, and MenX, respectively We analyzed the sequence variability of factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin-Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), three major antigens in the multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 4CMenB To broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) Novartis Vaccines has developed a vaccine for the prevention of MenB disease that contains four antigenic components: factor H binding protein (fHbp), neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisseria heparin binding antigen (NHBA) and outer membrane vesicles from a New Zealand epidemic strain (which provides PorA) The Oca (Oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin) family is a subgroup of the bacterial trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which includes structurally related proteins, such as YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica and NadA of Neisseria meningitidis Here we elucidate a novel phase variable mechanism for NadA, an adhesin and invasin of Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria meningitidis adhesin NadA targets beta1 integrins: functional similarity to Yersinia invasin. Human monocytes/macrophages are a target of Neisseria meningitidis Adhesin A (NadA). We have previously shown that NadA also promotes bacterial internalization in a heterologous expression system.  Its recombinant form NadA(Δ351-405,) devoid of the outer membrane domain, is an immunogenic candidate for an anti-MenB vaccine able to stimulate monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells.  Role of ARF6, Rab11 and external Hsp90 in the trafficking and recycling of recombinant-soluble Neisseria meningitidis adhesin A (rNadA) in human epithelial cells. A new vaccine (the 4CMenB 4-component protein vaccine [Bexsero], which includes PorA, factor H-binding protein [fHbp], neisserial heparin-binding antigen [NHBA], and Neisseria adhesin A [NadA]) against serogroup B meningococci has recently been approved for use in people older than age 2 months in Europe, Australia, and Canada. Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada. With the aim of studying the molecular diversity of the antigens of a new recombinant vaccine against meningococcus serogroup B, the three genes coding for the main vaccine components GNA (Genome-derived Neisseria Antigen) 1870 (fHbp, factor H Binding Protein), GNA1994 (NadA, Neisseria adhesin A) and GNA2132 were sequenced in a panel of 85 strains collected worldwide and selected as representative of the serogroup B meningococcal diversity. To broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA). 4CMenB vaccine antigens, PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisserial adhesin A (NadA) were molecularly typed by sequencing. Vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA). Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).Of the 263 IMD isolates analysed, 229, 16, 10, 7, and 1 belonged to MenB, MenY, MenW, MenC, and MenX, respectively. Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is one of the antigens of Bexsero, the recently licensed multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB). Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is present on the meningococcal surface and contributes to adhesion to and invasion of human cells. Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).

5fdb2f03a43ad31278000010	What is particular about the 3D structure of the inactive X chromosome?	How Xist RNA attaches to and propagates across a chromosome and its influence over the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the inactive X are aspects of XCI that have remained largely unclear.  The Xist long noncoding RNA orchestrates X chromosome inactivation, a process that entails chromosome-wide silencing and remodeling of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the X chromosome. Our results demonstrate that lamina recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription. The inactive X has two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal contacts separated by a boundary region. Comparison with the recently reported two-superdomain structure of the human inactive X shows that the genomic content of the superdomains differs between species, but part of the boundary region is conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but are located near the periphery of the 3D structure, as are regions enriched in CTCF or RNA polymerase. a specific bipartite organization of the mouse inactive X chromosome that probably plays an important role in maintenance of gene silencing. e have applied these approaches to analyze 3D microscopy images of the X-chromosome where four consecutive genomic regions (BACs) have been simultaneously labeled by multicolor FISH.

Characterization of the Neurochemical and Behavioral Effects of Solriamfetol (JZP-110), a Selective Dopamine and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor. The dual activity of solriamfetol at DA and NE transporters and the lack of significant monoamine-releasing properties of solriamfetol might explain the differences in the in vivo effects of solriamfetol compared with modafinil or amphetamine. BACKGROUND:: This study evaluated the human abuse potential of solriamfetol (formerly JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.  A new drug, solriamfetol, a selective norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is the first drug of its class that is being considered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat excessive sleepiness in OSA and narcolepsy patients.  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea with current or prior sleep apnea treatment. Moreover, the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol are probably owing to activity at DA and NE transporters rather than other neurotransmitter systems, such as histamine or orexin. Results indicate that solriamfetol has dual reuptake inhibition activity at dopamine (DA; IC50 = 2.9 μM) and norepinephrine (NE; IC50 = 4.4 μM) transporters, and this activity is associated in vivo with increased extracellular concentration of DA and NE as measured by microdialysis.

54e221f6ae9738404b000010	Describe the mechanism of action of aliskiren. 	Preliminary assignment a direct renin inhibitor aliskiren enhances the diuretic, natriuretic and kaliyuretic effects of the drug.  Aliskiren: An orally active renin inhibitor. Optimization of this compound by Novartis led to the development of aliskiren - the only direct renin inhibitor which is clinically used as an antihypertensive drug. Aliskiren is a new renin inhibitor of a novel structural class that has recently been shown to be efficacious in hypertensive patients after once-daily oral dosing. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that interrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at its rate-limiting step. THE READER WILL GAIN: Aliskiren, the first approved renin inhibitor to reach the market, is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic non-peptide molecule that blocks angiotensin I generation.  TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The DRI aliskiren is an effective antihypertensive agent that preliminary data suggests has a beneficial effect in CVD and CKD.  Aliskiren is a novel molecule which blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in its rate limiting step by renin inhibition. After discovery of the first direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, which blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the first rate limiting step, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), renin has become an important target nowadays.  Aliskiren, the first orally effective direct renin inhibitor, is an effective antihypertensive agent with distinctive properties including placebo-like tolerability, pharmacologic effects that persist after drug discontinuation, and a unique mechanism of action. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor to reach the market, is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic nonpeptide. Aliskiren blocks Ang I generation, while plasma renin concentration increases because the drugs blocks the negative feed-back exerted by Ang II on renin synthesis. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor. One drug that emerged from this effort is aliskiren, a direct human renin inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). With its unique mechanism of action, combining aliskiren with another RAAS-blocking agent that has a different mechanism of action may provide more comprehensive blockade of the RAAS, potentially conferring additional clinical benefits. In the ALTITUDE trial the use of the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, was associated with hypotensive episodes and an excess of ischaemic stroke Renin is the rate limiting enzyme of the RAAS and aliskiren is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the human renin Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of hypertension, blocks the RAAS at its point of activation With its unique mechanism of action, combining aliskiren with another RAAS-blocking agent that has a different mechanism of action may provide more comprehensive blockade of the RAAS, potentially conferring additional clinical benefits	['Aliskiren is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic non-peptide molecule that blocks renin and consequential angiotensin I generation.

5c6636c57c78d69471000011	What is the mechanism of action of arimoclomol?	Low dose co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, which induces Hsps, enhanced the ability of differentiated neurons to survive heat shock. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability as well as the preliminary efficacy of arimoclomol, a heat shock protein co-inducer that promotes nascent protein folding, in patients with rapidly progressive SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The heat shock protein amplifier arimoclomol improves refolding, maturation and lysosomal activity of glucocerebrosidase. The investigational drug arimoclomol, which is in phase II/III clinical trials, is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested.  Regioselective and enantiospecific synthesis of the HSP co-inducer arimoclomol from chiral glycidyl derivatives. Oral administration of arimoclomol, a small-molecule coinducer of HSPs that is currently in clinical trials for Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), recapitulated the effects of recombinant human HSP70, suggesting that heat shock protein-based therapies merit clinical evaluation for treating LSDs. Using rat myoblast cultures, we found that up-regulation of the heat shock response with arimoclomol reduced key pathological markers of sIBM in vitro.  The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression. We have previously shown that treatment with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. Arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress. Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. Arimoclomol is a co-activator that prolongs the binding of activated HSF1 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of inducible Hsp genes. The investigational drug arimoclomol, which is in phase II/III clinical trials, is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested. Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. OBJECTIVE To examine the safety and tolerability as well as the preliminary efficacy of arimoclomol, a heat shock protein co-inducer that promotes nascent protein folding, in patients with rapidly progressive SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have previously shown that treatment with arimoclomol, a co-inducer of the heat shock stress response, delays disease progression in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal motor neuron disease. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression.  The objectives of the present study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of arimoclomol in ALS.  In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by Arimoclomol and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response.

5a86bf2efaa1ab7d2e000033	What is the mechanism of the auxin-inducible degron system?	Fusion of inducible degradation signals, so-called degrons, to cellular proteins is an elegant method of controlling protein levels in vivo.  The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system allows the rapid and reversible proteolysis of proteins of interest, and enables the generation of conditional mutants of budding yeast. Strategies that use ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest, such as heat-inducible degron (td) and auxin-inducible degron (AID), are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants. Auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology allows rapid depletion of proteins in animal cells and fungi, but its application to human cells has been limited by the difficulties of tagging endogenous proteins. The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast. Here, we thoroughly and quantitatively characterize the auxin-inducible degron in single yeast cells. We show that an auxin concentration of 0.25 mM is necessary for fast and uniform protein depletion between single cells, and that in mother cells proteins are depleted faster than their daughters. we introduce an easy and efficient method to generate conditional knockout cell lines based on combining auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.  Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. Other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the SCF degradation pathway, allowing us to transplant the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system into nonplant cells and use a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability. We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1 in plants, in fission yeast. RESULTS We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1 in plants, in fission yeast. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. inducible inactivation of a protein is a powerful approach for analysis of its function within cells fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle however previously published strategies for protein depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest the aim of this work was to construct a useful and powerful protein depletion system in shizosaccaromyces pombe we constructed an auxin inducible degron aid system which utilizes auxin dependent poly ubiquitination of aux iaa proteins by scftir1 in plants in fission yeast although expression of a plant f box protein tir1 decreased mcm4 aid a component of the mcm complex essential for dna replication tagged with aux iaa peptide depletion did not result in an evident growth defect we successfully improved degradation efficiency of mcm4 aid by fusion of tir1 with fission yeast skp1 a conserved f box interacting component of scf improved aid system i aid and the cells showed severe defect in growth the i aid system induced degradation of mcm4 aid in the chromatin bound mcm complex as well as those in soluble fractions the i aid system in conjunction with transcription repression off aid system we achieved more efficient depletion of other proteins including pol1 and cdc45 causing early s phase arrest improvement of the aid system allowed us to construct conditional null mutants of s pombe we propose that the off aid system is the powerful method for in vivo protein depletion in fission yeast. plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the aux iaa

response to auxin and enabled us to generate efficient conditional mutants of essential proteins in yeast as well as cell lines derived from chicken mouse hamster monkey and human cells thus offering a powerful tool to control protein expression and study protein function. the analysis of consequences resulting after experimental elimination of gene function has been and will continue to be an extremely successful strategy in biological research mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly drosophila melanogaster rna interference is used extensively as well in the fly exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses however the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or rna interference is started targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function to this end a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting tir1 a plant f box protein which can recruit proteins with an auxin inducible degron to an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin here we demonstrate that the auxin inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in drosophila melanogaster neither auxin nor tir1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin inducible degron. isolation of a tight conditional mutant of a gene of interest is an effective way of studying the functions of essential genes strategies that use ubiquitin mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest such as heat inducible degron td and auxin inducible degron aid are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants however these methods do not work with some genes here we describe an improved aid system iaid for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in this method transcriptional repression by the tet off promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target protein by the aid system to provide examples we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors dpb11 and mcm10 dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid because dpb11 and mcm10 are required for the initiation of dna replication their tight mutants are unable to enter s phase this is the case for dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin both the tet off promoter and the aid system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast therefore the iaid system is not only useful in budding yeast but also can be applied to other model systems to isolate tight conditional mutants.	['Fusion of inducible degradation signals, so-called degrons, to cellular proteins is an elegant method of controlling protein levels in vivo.  The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system allows the rapid and reversible proteolysis of proteins of interest, and enables the generation of conditional mutants of budding yeast. Strategies that use ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest, such as heat-inducible degron (td) and auxin-inducible degron (AID), are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants. Auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology allows rapid depletion of proteins in animal cells and fungi, but its application to human cells has been limited by the difficulties of tagging endogenous proteins. The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast. Here, we thoroughly and quantitatively characterize the auxin-inducible degron in single yeast cells.', 'Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. Other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the SCF degradation pathway, allowing the transplantation of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system into nonplant cells and the use of a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability.']
5fdb4148a43ad31278000018	What is the role of Tcf3 in the maintenance of pluripotency?	Accordingly, the transcripts of the pluripotency genes Esrrb, Tfcp2l1, and Klf2, repressed by TCF3 in mESCs, are increased in TERRA-overexpressing cells. Further studies revealed that T cell factor 3 ( TCF3) is a potential downstream target of TERRA and mediates the effect of TERRA in mESC maintenance. One of these encodes T-cell factor 3 (TCF3), a transcription factor that plays important roles in ESC differentiation. Importantly, hnRNP H/F knockdown not only recapitulated the switch in TCF3 AS but also destabilized hESC colonies and induced differentiation. Providing an explanation for this, we show that expression of known TCF3 target E-cadherin, critical for maintaining ESC pluripotency, is repressed by E47 but not by E12. the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. Tcf3 is an integral component of the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells, which includes an autoregulatory loop involving the pluripotency regulators. Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that β-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3) supports mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by modulating Tcf3, but the critical targets downstream of Tcf3 are unclear. Conversely, forced expression phenocopied Gsk3 inhibition or Tcf3 deletion by suppressing differentiation and sustaining self-renewal. Wnt signaling regulates the lineage differentiation potential of mouse embryonic stem cells through Tcf3 down-regulation. We found that down-regulation of Tcf3, a member of the Tcf/Lef family and a key player in the control of self-renewal and pluripotency, represents a specific and primary response to Wnt activation in ESCs escuing Tcf3 expression partially restored the neural defects observed in Apc-mutant ESCs, suggesting that Tcf3 down-regulation is a necessary step towards Wnt-mediated suppression of neural differentiation. Tcf3 down-regulation in the context of constitutively active Wnt signaling does not result from promoter DNA methylation but is likely to be caused by a plethora of mechanisms at both the RNA and protein level as shown by the observed decrease in activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3-acetylation) and the upregulation of miR-211, a novel Wnt-regulated microRNA that targets Tcf3 and attenuates early neural differentiation in mouse ESCs. Wnt signaling down-regulates Tcf3 expression, possibly at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and thus highlight a novel mechanism through which Wnt signaling inhibits neuro-ectodermal lineage differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells. transcription factor 3 (TCF3), a target of miR-449a, could downregulate Nanog expression, and restoring TCF3 expression in miR-449a-expressing Nanog-negative cells abrogated cellular stemness. depletion of both Tcf3 and Lef1 enables maintenance of undifferentiated mouse ESCs	['The maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells relies on a transcriptional network that is fuelled by the activity of three transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) and balanced by the repressive activity of Tcf3 .

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates CTCF-dependent chromatin insulation.  the chromatin insulator protein CTCF carries a post-translational modification: poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis documented that the link between CTCF and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation extended to more than 140 mouse CTCF target sites.  poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation imparts chromatin insulator properties to CTCF at both imprinted and nonimprinted loci, which has implications for the regulation of expression domains and their demise in pathological lesions. The very rapid and transient post-translational modification of proteins by poly(ADP-ribose) has been shown to take part in all four. This review will discuss the impact of PARP1 on transcription and transcription factors, its implication in chromatin remodeling for DNA repair and probably also replication, and its role in controlling epigenetic events such as DNA methylation and the functionality of the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor. These data suggest that CTCF is involved in the cross-talk between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation and underscore the importance of a rapid reversal of PARP activity, as DNA methylation pattern is responsible for an important epigenetic code. We show that the chromatin insulator protein CTCF carries a post-translational modification: poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation mark, which exclusively segregates with the maternal allele of the insulator domain in the H19 imprinting control region, requires the bases that are essential for interaction with CTCF. chromatin insulators demarcate expression domains by blocking the cis effects of enhancers or silencers in a position dependent manner we show that the chromatin insulator protein ctcf carries a post translational modification poly adp ribosyl ation chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that a poly adp ribosyl ation mark which exclusively segregates with the maternal allele of the insulator domain in the h19 imprinting control region requires the bases that are essential for interaction with ctcf chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip analysis documented that the link between ctcf and poly adp ribosyl ation extended to more than 140 mouse ctcf target sites an insulator trap assay showed that the insulator function of most of these ctcf target sites is sensitive to 3 aminobenzamide an inhibitor of poly adp ribose polymerase activity we suggest that poly adp ribosyl ation imparts chromatin insulator properties to ctcf at both imprinted and nonimprinted loci which has implications for the regulation of expression domains and their demise in pathological lesions. ccctc binding factor ctcf is a ubiquitous zn finger containing protein with numerous recognized functions including but not limited to gene activation and repression enhancer blocking x chromosome inactivation and gene imprinting it is believed that the protein performs such a variety of functions by interacting with an array of very diverse proteins in addition ctcf undergoes several post translational modifications including poly adp ribosyl ation the parylated form of ctcf has recently been implicated in two important functions gene imprinting and control of ribosomal gene transcription here we summarize and critically discuss the available data on the interplay between ctcf and poly adp ribosyl ation in these two processes we consider the newly described phenomena in the broader context of parp s activities including the crucial role of protein parylation in the regulation of the genome methylation pattern.

58ee217feda5a57672000015	How are topologically associating domains (TAD) associated with replication timing?	Topologically associating domains and their long-range contacts are established during early G1 coincident with the establishment of the replication-timing program. Determinants of the replication-timing program are re-established during early G1 phase of each cell cycle and lost in G2 phase, but it is not known when TAD structure and inter-TAD contacts are re-established after their elimination during mitosis. We find that both establishment of TADs and their compartmentalization occur during early G1, within the same time frame as establishment of the replication-timing program.  Overall, this study uncovers a strong connection between chromatin re-organization during G1, establishment of replication timing, and its developmental control. Topologically associating domains are stable units of replication-timing regulation. Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs).  We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment.  Hi-C also segregates inter-TAD contacts into defined 3D spatial compartments that align precisely to genome-wide replication timing profiles. With a novel domain-based alignment proposed by us, we defined several types of hierarchical TAD changes which were not systematically studied previously, and subsequently used them to reveal that TADs and sub-TADs differed statistically in correlating chromosomal compartment, replication timing and gene transcription. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. The genome of metazoan cells is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) that have similar histone modifications, transcription level, and DNA replication timing. Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains.

Longitudinal outcomes of children with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) Antibiotics have been used extensively by clinicians to treat patients with PANDAS or PANS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) OBJECTIVES Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) is a newly defined disease in neuropsychiatry and occurs with an autoimmune mechanism after Group A Beta Hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) infection. The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) are basically characterized by obsessive-compulsive symptoms and/or tics triggered by group-A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infections. PANDAS Syndrome (Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus) is a rare disease described in 1998. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) is a well-defined syndrome in which tics (motor and/or vocal) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder consistently exacerbate in temporal correlation to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Of recent interest, a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders known collectively as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS) is believed to be secondary to central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity that occurs in relation to group A streptococcal infection.

There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant, a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of telephones.  No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone.   Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in the international INTERPHONE analyses. The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1.8,95% CI=1.1-3.2, digital phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.8, cordless phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.9. For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend was for analogue phones OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.02-1.19, digital phones OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.01-1.22, and cordless phones OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.19. There was a tendency of a shorter tumour induction period for ipsilateral exposure to microwaves than for contralateral, which may indicate a tumour promotor effect. Case reports of brain tumours in users initiated this case-control study on brain tumours and use of cellular telephones. Increased risk was found only for use of the NMT system.  This increased HR was based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme). Some studies show increasing incidence of brain tumours whereas other studies do not. The meta-analysis gave for glioma in the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.81 in the ≥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell group) latency group. Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2.29, 95% CI=1.56-3.37.  After 1983 and during the period with increasing prevalence of mobile phone users, the incidence has remained relatively stable for both men and women.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have raised the possibility that patient-specific insulin-secreting cells might be derived from somatic cells through cell fate reprogramming. We demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs might be ideal substitutes to induce pancreatic differentiation in hiPSCs. Pluripotent stem cells as a potential tool for disease modelling and cell therapy in diabetes. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs). ESCs and iPSCs have a great potential to differentiate into all cell types, and they have a high ability to differentiate into insulin-secreting β cells.  Several iPSC lines have been recently generated from patients with different types of diabetes, and most of these cell lines are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting β cells. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the differentiation of pancreatic β cells from PSCs, and describe the challenges for their clinical use in diabetes cell therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PDX-1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1), NeuroD1 (neurogenic differentiation-1) and MafA (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A) in the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into insulin-producing cells and to explore this new approach of cell transplantation therapy for type 1 diabetes in mice.  iPSCs were infected with adenovirus (Ad-Mouse PDX-1-IRES-GFP, Ad-Mouse NeuroD1-IRES-GFP and Ad-Mouse Mafa-IRES-GFP) and then differentiated into insulin-producing cells in vitro.  The insulin-producing cells we obtained from three-gene-modified EBs may be used as seed cells for tissue engineering and may represent a cell replacement strategy for the production of β cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. To date, the pathogenesis of diabetes is far to be understood, and there is no permanent treatment available for diabetes. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs).	['One of the promising approaches to cure diabetes is to use induced PCSs (iPSCs) and to differentiate them into insulin-secreting β cells.

5fdb2e91a43ad3127800000e	What is the function of the zelda transcription factor in D. melanogaster?	The zinc-finger protein Zelda is a key activator of the early zygotic genome in Drosophila Here we report that the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Zld; Zinc-finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. We demonstrated that Grh and the previously characterized transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld) bind to different TAGteam sequences with varying affinities, and that Grh competes with Zld for TAGteam occupancy. Recently the discovery of the transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld), which binds to CAGGTAG and related sequences present in the enhancers of many early-activated genes in Drosophila, hinted at a mechanism for how batteries of genes could be simultaneously activated. In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation The Drosophila Zelda transcription factor plays an important role in regulating transcription at the embryonic maternal-to-zygotic transition. n summary, Zelda collaborates with bHLH-PAS proteins to directly regulate midline and tracheal expression of an evolutionary dynamic enhancer in the post-blastoderm embryo. We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zelda binding sites accelerates the kinetics of nuclei transcriptional activation regardless of their transcriptional past.  We propose that Zelda facilitates transcriptional activation by accumulating in microenvironments where it could accelerate the duration of multiple pre-initiation steps. The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility.  Further, we also demonstrate that zld is critical for posterior segmentation in the hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, indicating this function predates the origin of holometabolous insects and was subsequently lost in long-germ insects. Overall our analysis suggests that GAF, together with Zelda, plays an important role in activating the zygotic genome  In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Zelda plays an essential role in widespread activation of the zygotic genome This demonstrates that highly regulated levels of Zelda activity are required for establishing the developmental program during the MZT Zelda overcomes the high intrinsic nucleosome barrier at enhancers during Drosophila zygotic genome activation. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription In Drosophila, the DNA-binding protein Zelda (also known as Vielfaltig) is required for this transition and for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Although the mechanisms driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process in Drosophila melanogaster.  Zelda potentiates morphogen activity by increasing chromatin accessibility. Zelda (Zld) plays such a role in the Drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear. rthermore, a putative homologue of the Zelda gene has been considered, which in D. melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding factor responsible for the maternal-to-zygotic transition.CO In the endopterygote Drosophila melanogaster, Zelda is an activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The transcription factor Zelda plays a pivotal role in promoting the maternal to zygotic transition during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. A conserved maternal-specific repressive domain in Zelda revealed by Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility. zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility.

A phase I study of pexidartinib, a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors. Background Pexidartinib, a novel, orally administered small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has strong selectivity against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. The CSF1 receptor inhibitor pexidartinib (PLX3397) reduces tissue macrophage levels without affecting glucose homeostasis in mice. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) controls macrophage differentiation, and here we sought to determine the effect of a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, PLX3397, on adipose tissue macrophage levels and understand the impact on glucose homeostasis in mice. To address the role of these cells in disease pathogenesis, we depleted microglia from R6/2 mice, a rapidly progressing model of Huntington's disease marked by behavioural impairment, mutant huntingtin (mHTT) accumulation, and early death, through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition (CSF1Ri) with pexidartinib (PLX3397) for the duration of disease. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors.

51600ca2298dcd4e51000037	What is the function of the yeast protein Aft1?	Using a scheme for selecting mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with abnormalities of iron metabolism, we have identified a gene, AFT1, that mediates the control of iron uptake AFT1 functions to activate transcription of target genes in response to iron deprivation and thereby plays a central role in iron homeostasis. Iron-regulated DNA binding by the AFT1 protein controls the iron regulon in yeast Iron deprivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces transcription of genes required for high-affinity iron uptake. AFT1 mediates this transcriptional control. The AFT1 transcriptional factor is differentially required for expression of high-affinity iron uptake genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aft1 displays phosphorylation modifications depending on the growth stage of the cells, and it might link induction of genes for iron uptake to other metabolically dominant requirement for cell growth. an aft1 mutation in S. cerevisiae that makes cells dependent on iron for growth Subcellular localization of Aft1 transcription factor responds to iron status in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Aft1 transcription factor regulates the iron regulon in response to iron availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aft1 activates a battery of genes required for iron uptake under iron-starved conditions, whereas Aft1 function is inactivated under iron-replete conditions the nuclear export of Aft1 is critical for ensuring iron-responsive transcriptional activation of the Aft1 regulon and that the nuclear import/export systems are involved in iron sensing by Aft1 in S. cerevisiae. the Aft1 iron-responsive DNA-binding factor Two transcriptional activators, Aft1 and Aft2, regulate iron homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 is not linked to the maturation of cytosolic/nuclear Fe-S proteins The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a pair of paralogous iron-responsive transcription activators, Aft1 and Aft2. Aft1 activates the cell surface iron uptake systems in iron depletion, the absence of either Aft1 or Aft2 showed an iron-dependent increase in the amount of the remaining paralog The transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulate the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. iron insufficiency-responsive transcription factor Aft1 The mRNA levels of 14 proteins involved in iron homeostasis were shown to be increased by cisplatin. Interestingly, the expression of all 14 genes is known to be regulated by Aft1, a transcription factor activated in response to iron insufficiency Aft1 is a transcriptional activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that responds to iron availability and regulates the expression of genes in the iron regulon we found that Aft1 physically interacts with the FOB (ferrioxamine B) transporter Arn3 These results suggest that Aft1 interacts with Arn3 and may regulate the ubiquitination of Arn3 in the cytosolic compartment The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Aft1 is activated in iron-deficient cells to induce the expression of iron regulon genes, which coordinate the increase of iron uptake and remodel cellular metabolism to survive low-iron conditions Aft1 has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including cell-cycle progression and chromosome stability We demonstrate that Aft1 works in parallel with the RIM101 pH pathway and the role of Aft1 in DNA damage repair is mediated by iron. In contrast, through both directed studies and microarray transcriptional profiling, we show that the role of Aft1 in chromosome maintenance and benomyl resistance is independent of its iron regulatory role, potentially through a nontranscriptional mechanism. Aft1p is a major iron regulator in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It indirectly senses cytosolic Fe status and responds by activating or repressing iron regulon genes Expression of components of the high-affinity system is controlled by the Aft1 transcriptional factor Iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1 interacts with kinetochore protein Iml3 and promotes pericentromeric cohesin The Saccharomyces cerevisiae iron-responsive transcription factor, Aft1, has a well established role in regulating iron homeostasis through the transcriptional induction of iron-regulon genes recent studies have implicated Aft1 in other cellular processes independent of iron regulation such as chromosome stability Aft1 interacts with and co-localizes with kinetochore proteins Our work defines a new role for Aft1 in chromosome stability and transmission. Our genetic network reveals that Aft1 affects a diverse range of cellular processes, including the RIM101 pH pathway, cell-wall stability, DNA damage, protein transport, chromosome stability, and mitochondrial function.

Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a segmental premature aging disease causing patient death by early teenage years from cardiovascular dysfunction Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, characterized by progressive premature aging and early death in the first or second decade of life, usually secondary to cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke). Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating premature aging disease. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear scaffold proteins lamin A and C. In HGPS and related progerias, processing of prelamin A is blocked at a critical step mediated by the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. BACKGROUND: Progeria is a rare segmental premature aging disease with significant skeletal abnormalities. Progeria is a rare, genetically determined condition characterized by accelerated aging in children. Werner syndrome, also called adult progeria, is a heritable autosomal recessive human disorder characterized by the premature onset of numerous age-related diseases including juvenile cataracts, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Werner sy Werner syndrome (i.e., adult progeria) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the WRN gene, which is characterized by the premature appearance of features associated with normal aging and cancer predisposition. Patie Werner's syndrome (adult progeria) is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized mainly by a characteristic habitus (short stature, light body weight) scleroderma like changes of the limbs and premature aging. Chronic The Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome or progeria is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by premature aging and involvement of internal systems, such as the circulatory and locomotor. Th The glycosylation of proteins in fibroblasts from people with the premature ageing disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria) was investigated. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, progeria) is an extremely rare premature aging disorder affecting children, with a disease incidence of ∼1 in 18 million individuals. INTRODUCTION: Progeria also known as Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) (MIM176670) is a very uncommon fatal genetic untimely aging syndrome. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare disease that results in what appears to be premature aging, is caused by the production of a mutant form of prelamin A known as progerin. Although children with progeria have the appearance of premature aging or senility, the term is misleading because reported cases of progeria have not manifested most physical or biochemical aspects of old age. The Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome or progeria is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by premature aging and involvement of internal systems, such as the circulatory and locomotor. The basic genetic defect in the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria), a premature aging syndrome, is unknown. Progeria: a rare genetic premature ageing disorder. Progeria is characterized by clinical features that mimic premature ageing. Progeria is a rare fatal genetic condition characterized by an appearance of accelerated aging in children. Progeria is a rare and peculiar combination of dwarfism and premature aging. Progeria is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder of premature aging characterized by marked growth retardation and specific, progressive, premature senescent changes of the skin and other tissues. Progeria is an autosomal dominant, premature aging syndrome. Progeria is a rare genetic disease with striking features that resemble accelerated aging. Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, is an extremely rare, severe genetic condition wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. Progeria: a human-disease model of accelerated aging.

5890f4ab621ea6ff7e000008	What is the role of Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in glioma treatment?	OBJECTIVE MR-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) can be used to treat intracranial tumors, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes.  Eight patients had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 1 had a previously treated GBM with radiation necrosis, and 1 had a melanoma brain metastasis.  CONCLUSIONS Laser interstitial thermal therapy followed by minimally invasive transsulcal resection, reported here for the first time, is a novel option for patients with large, DTA, malignant brain neoplasms. MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy is currently used as a minimally invasive treatment for brain metastases, radiation necrosis, glioma, and epilepsy.  The role of laser interstitial thermal therapy in enhancing progression-free survival of difficult-to-access high-grade gliomas: a multicenter study. We report our multicenter results of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in DTA-HGGs. We retrospectively reviewed 34 consecutive DTA-HGG patients (24 glioblastoma, 10 anaplastic) who underwent LITT at Cleveland Clinic, Washington University, and Wake Forest University (May 2011-December 2012) using the NeuroBlate(®) System.  LITT can be used effectively for treatment of DTA-HGGs. More complete coverage of tumor by TDT lines improves PFS which can be translated as the extent of resection concept for surgery. Stereotactic laser ablation of high-grade gliomas. Recent advances in intraoperative imaging have spurred the use of stereotactic laser ablation (laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT]) for intracranial lesions. Among other targets, laser ablation has been used in the focal treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGGs).  Results of the NeuroBlate System first-in-humans Phase I clinical trial for recurrent glioblastoma: clinical article. OBJECT: Laser interstitial thermal therapy has been used as an ablative treatment for glioma; however, its development was limited due to technical issues.  CONCLUSIONS: NeuroBlate represents new technology for delivering laser interstitial thermal therapy, allowing controlled thermal ablation of deep hemispheric rGBM.  Ongoing researches concern the adjunction of local treatments within the surgical field (photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, convection immunotherapy...), but also the development of minimal invasive procedures (radiosurgery, high intensity focalized ultrasounds, laser interstitial thermal therapy). Current commercially available LITT systems have been used for the treatment of neurosurgical soft-tissue lesions, including difficult to access brain tumors, malignant gliomas, and radiosurgery-resistant metastases, as well as for the ablation of such lesions as epileptogenic foci and radiation necrosis.

5a76dd749e632bc066000008	What does VBP15 do to skeletal muscle?	We find VBP15 protects and promotes efficient repair of skeletal muscle cells upon laser injury, in opposition to prednisolone. Potent inhibition of NF-κB is mediated through protein interactions of the glucocorticoid receptor, however VBP15 shows significantly reduced hormonal receptor transcriptional activity. The translation of these drug mechanisms into DMD model mice improves muscle strength, live-imaging and pathology through both preventive and post-onset intervention regimens. These data demonstrate successful improvement of dystrophy independent of hormonal, growth, or immunosuppressive effects, indicating VBP15 merits clinical investigation for DMD and would benefit other chronic inflammatory diseases.

54f1e887c409818c32000004	What is known about thalidomide therapy and survival of glioblastoma patients?	In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The authors previously reported improved outcome in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with thalidomide and irinotecan compared with historical controls.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and irinotecan did not achieve sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation against AG, although a subset of patients experienced prolonged PFS/OS.  The treatment regimen was well tolerated. OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT. The addition of celecoxib and thalidomide to adjuvant temozolomide was well tolerated but did not meet the primary end point of improvement of 4-month PFS from study enrollment. CONCLUSION: The combination of irinotecan and thalidomide has limited activity against GBM. The combination of irinotecan, a cytotoxic agent, and thalidomide, an antiangiogenic agent, shows promising activity against recurrent GBM in patients not receiving EIACs and warrants further study.  CONCLUSION: The administration of temozolomide in association with thalidomide after radiotherapy (RT) does not offer an advantage over temozolomide alone in adults with newly diagnosed GBM. The two therapeutic strategies produce similar results for survival, but the latter regimen shows a moderate increase in toxicity. CONCLUSION: This drug combination was reasonably safe, but with little indication of improvement compared to temozolomide alone. In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased. Experimental studies have demonstrated that thalidomide has anti-tumor activity mediated by blockage of angiogenesis, with clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme, and renal cell cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy was relatively well tolerated, but there was no survival advantage compared with historical studies using XRT either with adjuvant nitrosourea chemotherapy, with TMZ alone, or with the combination of TMZ and thalidomide. PURPOSE: The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide have both demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy of combination TMZ, thalid and RT was relatively well tolerated with favorable survival outcome for patients with GM when compared to patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and similar to those who have received nitrosourea adjuvant chemotherapy. It is unclear the added advantage thalid has in combination with TMZ for this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and temozolomide in the treatment of GBM appears to be more effective than that of thalidomide alone with respect to survival, TTP, and neuroradiological documentation of progression, stable disease or response.  In conclusion, thalidomide induces modest side effects and it may be considered a valid therapeutic option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Thalidomide is a well-tolerated drug that may have some activity in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.  Eight patients were alive more than 1 year after starting thalidomide, although almost all with tumor progression.   In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thalidomide prolongs disease stabilization after conventional therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression	['Findings regarding clinical value of thalidomide in terms of survival in patients with glioblastoma remain mixed. It has been shown that thalidomide can improve survival of recurrent glioblastoma patients. However, other authors have not confirmed these findings.

532624ae600967d132000005	What are the outcomes of Renal sympathetic denervation?	Significant decreases and progressively higher reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after RSD. The complication rate was minimal.  In conclusion, the RSD presents itself as an effective and safe approach to resistant hypertension. Renal sympathetic denervation delivers not only a decrease in blood pressure levels but also renal as well as systemic sympathetic nerve activity. The reduction in blood pressure appears to be sustained over 3 years after the procedure, which implies no counterregulatory mechanism or re-innervation of afferent renal sympathetic nerve so far. Renal sympathetic denervation not only reduces blood pressure but also renal as well as systemic sympathetic nerve activity in such patients. The reduction in blood pressure appears to be sustained over 3 years after the procedure, which suggests absence of re-innervation of renal sympathetic nerves. Safety appears to be adequate. Clinical trials of renal sympathetic denervation have shown significant reductions in blood pressure in these patients. Renal sympathetic denervation also reduces heart rate, which is a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk.  Small studies suggest that RSD can produce dramatic blood pressure reductions: In the randomized Symplicity HTN-2 trial of 106 patients, the mean fall in blood pressure at 6 months in patients who received the treatment was 32/12 mm Hg. However, there are limitations to the evidence for RSD in the treatment of resistant hypertension. These include the small number of patients studied; the lack of any placebo-controlled evidence; the fact that blood pressure outcomes were based on office assessments, as opposed to 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; the lack of longer-term efficacy data; and the lack of long-term safety data. Clinical evaluation of selective renal sympathetic denervation demonstrated a decrease of renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, an increase of renal plasma flow, and has confirmed clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. In addition to drug treatment, baroreceptor stimulation therapy and renal sympathetic denervation are promising new approaches in this group of patients. Early clinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated sympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure. The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial is a pivotal study designed as a prospective, randomized, masked procedure, single-blind trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of catheter-based bilateral renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension despite compliance with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (at least one of which is a diuretic) at maximal tolerable doses. Novel procedure- and device-based strategies to control hypertension include renal sympathetic denervation and baroreflex sensitization.

5319a7f2b166e2b80600002a	What is the result of the interaction between TSC1 and PLK1?	Phosphorylated hamartin interacts with Plk1 independent of tuberin with all three proteins present in a complex. Hamartin negatively regulates the protein levels of Plk1. Finally, Tsc1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased number of centrosomes and increased DNA content, compared to Tsc1(+/+) cells. Both phenotypes are rescued after pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. RNAi inhibition of Plk1 in Tsc1(-/-) MEFs failed to rescue the increased centrosome number phenotype.

Painful stiffening of the shoulder, 'frozen shoulder' is a common cause of shoulder pain and disability. Current adhesive capsulitis was defined as restriction of external rotation and one or more additional directional restrictions with history of shoulder pain. Adhesive capsulitis is a clinical syndrome of pain and severely decreased joint motion ("frozen shoulder") caused by thickening and contraction of the joint capsule and synovium. Adhesive capsulitis is, in most cases, a self-limiting condition of poorly understood etiology that results in shoulder pain and large mobility deficits.  Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is a condition of unknown etiology that results in the development of restriction of active and passive glenohumeral motion.

Antitumor Potency of an Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy, Lisocabtagene Maraleucel in Combination With Ibrutinib or Acalabrutinib. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a promising treatment for patients with CD19 B-cell malignancies. Combination strategies that improve CAR T-cell potency, limit tumor environment-mediated immune dysfunction, and directly reduce tumor burden may increase the potential for durable clinical benefit of CAR T-cell therapy. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is a product therapy candidate being tested in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

511a51331159fa8212000009	What is the function of the viral KP4 protein?	antifungal protein KP4 Killer protein 4 (KP4) is a well studied viral toxin secreted by the maize smut fungus Ustilago maydis that kills sensitive Ustilago strains as well as inhibits Fusarium and plant root growth by inhibiting calcium uptake. Our previous work on a virally encoded fungal toxin, KP4, from Ustilago maydis and subsequently with the plant defensin, MsDef1, from Medicago sativa demonstrated that some of these proteins specifically blocked calcium channels in both fungi and animals. The results presented here demonstrate that KP4 and three plant defensins, MsDef1, MtDef2, and RsAFP2, all inhibit root growth in germinating Arabidopsis seeds at low micromolar concentrations . There are three well-characterized killer toxins in U. maydis-KP1, KP4, and KP6-which are secreted by the P1, P4, and P6 subtypes, respectively. These killer toxins are small polypeptides encoded by segments of an endogenous, persistent double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus in each U. maydis subtype. The viral gene for the killer protein 4 (KP4) has been explored for its antifungal effect antifungal protein KP4 from Ustilago maydis-infecting virus The antifungal activity correlated with the presence of the KP4 transgene. These results suggest that KP4 may inhibit cell growth and division by blocking calcium-regulated signal transduction pathways. KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis. KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis. Our results defining the type of mammalian channel affected by this fungal toxin further support our contention that KP4 inhibits fungal growth by blocking transmembrane calcium flux through fungal calcium channels, Killer toxins are polypeptides secreted by some fungal species that kill sensitive cells of the same or related species. In the best-characterized cases, they function by creating new pores in the cell membrane and disrupting ion fluxes KP4 is a virally encoded and highly specific toxin that kills fungi closely related to the fungus Ustilago maydis. The P4 strain of the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis, secretes a fungal toxin, KP4, encoded by a fungal virus (UMV4) that persistently infects its cells. These results led to experiments demonstrating that the toxin specifically inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mammalian cells. Ustilago maydis killer toxins are small polypeptides (7-14 kDa) which kill susceptible cells of closely related fungal species. The KP4 toxin is a single polypeptide subunit with a molecular weight of 11.1 kDa	['The virally encoded fungal toxin KP4  specifically blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.']

52d3cc5203868f1b06000037	How are CpG island shores defined?	Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'.   Here, we find substantial hypermethylation and hypomethylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island shores in nine human iPS cell lines as compared to their parental fibroblasts Recent genome-wide descriptions of CpG methylation patterns in mammalian cells identified many differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located at CpG island "shores." Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. This analysis revealed leukemia-associated differentially methylated regions that included gene promoters, gene bodies, CpG islands and CpG island shores. We observed that methylation probes associated with expression in cis were more likely to be located outside CpG islands, whereas specificity for CpG island shores was present when methylation, associated with expression, was under local genetic control. Aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands, CpG island shores and first exons is known to play a key role in the altered gene expression patterns in all human cancers.  In particular, neuronal-type differential methylation was overrepresented in CpG island shores, enriched within gene bodies but not in intergenic regions, and preferentially harbored binding motifs for a distinct set of transcription factors, including neuron-specific activity-dependent factors.

5ace2d600340b9f05800000e	What phenotype is associated with the V60L mutation in the human MC1R gene?	An additional three low-penetrance alleles V60L, V92M, and R163Q have odds ratios 6, 5, and 2 relative to the wild-type allele.  Genetic association and cellular function of MC1R variant alleles in human pigmentation. We have investigated 174 individuals from 11 large kindreds with a preponderance of red hair and an additional 99 unrelated redheads, for MC1R variants and have confirmed that red hair is usually inherited as a recessive characteristic with the R151C, R160W, D294H, R142H, 86insA and 537insC alleles at this locus. The V60L variant, which is common in the population may act as a partially penetrant recessive allele.  In vitro expression studies revealed that variant receptors with reduced cell surface expression, including V60L, D84E, R151C, I155T, R160W and R163Q, showed a corresponding impairment in cAMP coupling. Among the fifteen MC1R variants identified, the nine most common were V60L, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q, R142H, D294H, D84E, and I155T. Both of these Thr(111)/Ala(111) heterozygotes carried a single polymorphism of MC1R (one with the V92M variant and another with the V60L variant) The V60L-/- homozygote r variant cells showed similar responses to ligand as WT MC1R strains, while V92M-/- homozygote r variant cells were generally shown to have greater dendricity and express higher DCT than the WT cells, even at basal levels.  Simultaneous purifying selection on the ancestral MC1R allele and positive selection on the melanoma-risk allele V60L in south Europeans. different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair) All of the investigated variants showed positive associations with NMSC, with consistent significant results obtained for V60L, D84E, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q and D294H: SOR (95%CI) ranged from 1.42 (1.19-1.70) for V60L to 2.66 (1.06-6.65) for D84E variant. The characterization of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on human melanocytes and the findings that certain mutations in the POMC gene or the MC1R gene result in red hair phenotype underscore the significance of melanocortins and MC1R in regulating human pigmentation. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Thus, at least in Spain, regions at opposite ends of the incident UV-B radiation distribution show significantly different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair), with higher frequency of V60L at those regions of lower incident UV-B radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Alleles associated with the red hair color (RHC) phenotype and with the risk of melanoma were examined. Thus, at least in Spain, regions at opposite ends of the incident UV-B radiation distribution show significantly different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair), with higher frequency of V60L at those regions of lower incident UV-B radiation. The combination of the prediction tools results in 14 nsSNPs indicated as the most damaging mutations in MC1R (L48P, R67W, H70Y, P72L, S83P, R151H, S172I, L206P, T242I, G255R, P256S, C273Y, C289R and R306H); C273Y showed to be highly damaging in SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutPred, PANTHER and PROVEAN scores. In stratified analysis, there was no consistent pattern of association between MC1R and NMSC by skin type, but we consistently observed higher SORs for subjects without red hair. These results indicate that reduced receptor coupling activity may not be the only contributing factor to the genetic association between the MC1R variants and the RHC phenotype, with MC1R polymorphisms now linked to a change in receptor localization. Here we used 11 computational tools based on different approaches to predict the damage-associated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the coding region of the human MC1R gene. Variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene are common in individuals with red hair and fair skin, but the relative contribution to these pigmentary traits in heterozygotes, homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for variants at this locus from the multiple alleles present in Caucasian populations is unclear. Here we show that a missense mutation in the coatomer protein complex, subunit alpha (COPA), a gene with previously no known role in pigmentation synthesis, is completely associated with Dominant Red in Holstein dairy cattle. Coat color in Holstein dairy cattle is primarily controlled by the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, a central determinant of black (eumelanin) vs. red/brown pheomelanin synthesis across animal species. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Several MC1R variant alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk. Prediction of the damage-associated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human MC1R gene. We performed a meta-analysis on the association between the 9 most studied MC1R variants (p.V60L, p.D84E, p.V92M, p.R142H, p.R151C, p.I155T, p.R160W, p.R163Q and p.D294H) and melanoma and/or red hair, fair skin phenotype.

In the intermediate-risk subgroup, the 70-gene signature could be useful to decide in elderly patients whether they may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Adjuvant assessment tools for prognosis and prediction of treatment benefit, including Adjuvant! Online, the St Gallen Consensus, Oncotype DX(®) and MammaPrint(®), aid clinical decision making The 70-gene MammaPrint prognosis profile accurately identified Japanese breast cancer patients at low risk of developing recurrences. In fact, 100% of the individuals in the low-risk category remained metastasis-free for the duration of the observation period. he probability of distant metastasis-free survival at five years was 100% for the low-risk group and 94% for the high-risk group. The 70-gene prognosis signature can accurately select postmenopausal patients at low risk of breast cancer-related death within 5 years of diagnosis and can be of clinical use in selecting postmenopausal women for adjuvant chemotherapy. The 70-gene signature (MammaPrint) is a prognostic tool used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions A pCR is unlikely to be achieved in tumors that have a good prognosis-signature. Tumors with a poor prognosis-signature are more sensitive to chemotherapy. The EWG found adequate evidence to characterize the association of MammaPrint with future metastases, but inadequate evidence to assess the added value to standard risk stratification, and could not determine the population to which the test would best apply. he EWG found no evidence regarding the clinical utility of the MammaPrint and Quest H:I Ratio tests, and inadequate evidence regarding Oncotype DX. These technologies have potential for both benefit and harm MammaPrint, an oligonucleotide microassay performed on fresh-frozen tumor samples, analyzes the expression of 70 genes. Studies have found that MammaPrint allows young patients (<61 years) with early-stage breast cancer to be categorized as having a high or low risk of distant metastasis. High-risk patients may then be managed with more aggressive therapy.	['MammaPrint has a prognostic value for distant metastasis and death, as well as predictive value for response to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. However, the EGAPP Working Group found no evidence regarding the clinical utility of the MammaPrint.']

Mutation c.197G>T p.G66V in CHCHD10 is the cause of the lower motor neuron syndrome LOSMoN/SMAJ. During the preparation of this article other mutations were reported to cause frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis syndrome, indicating that the CHCHD10 gene is largely important for the motor and cognitive neuronal systems. Mutation in the novel nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 in a family with autosomal dominant mitochondrial myopathy. Our findings identify a novel gene causing mitochondrial myopathy, thereby expanding the spectrum of mitochondrial myopathies caused by nuclear genes.  Mutations in the CHCHD10 gene have been recently identified in a large family with a complex phenotype variably associating frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, and hearing impairment. The observation of a frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype in a mitochondrial disease led us to analyse CHCHD10 in a cohort of 21 families with pathologically proven frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We identified the same missense p.Ser59Leu mutation in one of these families.  This study demonstrates the implication of CHCHD10 in FTD and ALS spectrum. However, the exact contribution of CHCHD10 in FTD and ALS diseases spectrum remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of CHCHD10 mutations in 115 patients with FTD and FTD-ALS phenotypes.

DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) has emerged as one of the most comprehensive and versatile methods available for profiling protein-DNA interactions on a genomic scale.  Recently, a novel methylation-based tagging technique, termed DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification), has emerged as a powerful tool to decipher transcriptional networks, to study chromatin-associated proteins, and to monitor higher-order chromatin organization on a genome-wide scale. We show here that the in vivo methylation-based tagging technique DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification) can be used for studies of DNA-protein interactions or chromatin profiling in plants DamID is a powerful method used to map the genomic interaction sites of these proteins in vivo  It is based on fusing a protein of interest to Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (dam). Expression of this fusion protein in vivo leads to preferential methylation of adenines in DNA surrounding the native binding sites of the dam fusion partner. Because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) is an enzymatic technology for detecting DNA regions targeted by chromatin-associated proteins.

514a2649d24251bc0500005a	How functional connectivity of the default mode network changes in patients with disorders of consciousness?	Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is known to be reduced in patients with disorders of consciousness, to a different extent depending on their clinical severity. Patients showed significant impairments in all of the pathways connecting cortical regions within this network, as well as the pathway connecting the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus with the thalamus, relative to the healthy volunteers. Moreover, the structural integrity of this pathway, as well as that of those connecting the posterior areas of the network, was correlated with the patients' behavioral signs for awareness, being higher in EMCS patients than those in the upper and lower ranges of the MCS patients, and lowest in VS patients. These results provide a possible neural substrate for the functional disconnection previously described in these patients, and reinforce the importance of the DMN in the genesis of awareness and the neural bases of its disorders. Although the functional significance of the default-mode network remains a matter of debate, it has been suggested to be a candidate for the network subserving basic functions related to consciousness. Despite resolution of corpus callosum lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 week, the patient persistently presented disturbance of consciousness. Resting-state functional MRI revealed that the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus was functionally disconnected from other brain regions within the default-mode network. Our case report suggests that assessment of the functional connectivity in the resting-state default-mode network could be a useful marker of consciousness disturbance even in the presence of a reversible brain lesion. A present and intact DMN was observed in controls and those patients who subsequently regained consciousness, but was disrupted in all patients who failed to regain consciousness. The results suggest that the DMN is necessary but not sufficient to support consciousness. Clinically, DMN connectivity may serve as an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness. Recent studies on resting state activity in DOC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, show that functional connectivity is disrupted in the task-negative or the default mode network. This report shows for the first time, in three patients, that the persistent vegetative state (PVS) is marked by a dysfunctional default mode network, with decreased connectivity in several brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex, especially in the right hemisphere.	['Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is reduced in patients with different disorders of consciousness, and correlates with the level of consciousness. \nSpecifically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was shown to be absent in brain death patients, extremely low in vegetative state patients and slightly decreased in minimally conscious state patients when compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, functional connectivity in the default mode network was suggested to be valuable in differentiating patients with different disorders of consciousness. Clinically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was also shown to be an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness.']

Using an unsupervised pattern-discovery method, we processed the human intergenic and intronic regions and catalogued all variable-length patterns with identically conserved copies and multiplicities above what is expected by chance. Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 patterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes In a recent paper in PNAS, Rigoutsos et al. (2006) describe a nonrandom pattern of repeated elements, called pyknons, which are found more frequently in the 3' untranslated regions of genes than in other regions of the human genome Discovery of pyknons, the most frequent, variable-length DNA sequence motifs in the human genomes, suggests extensive sequence-based connectivity between non-coding and protein-coding components of human genomes Short blocks from the noncoding parts of the human genome have instances within nearly all known genes and relate to biological processes. Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA that also appear at least once among coding genes. They are interesting because they portend an unforeseen connection between coding and non-coding DNA. Pyknons have only been discovered in the human genome, so it is unknown whether pyknons have wider biological relevance or are simply a phenomenon of the human genome these data reveal that pyknons represent a biologically important link between coding and non-coding DNA Pyknons are non-random sequence patterns significantly repeated throughout non-coding genomic DNA that also appear at least once among coding genes.

58af11e67125859353000001	What is the function of the Mis18 protein?	Mis16 and Mis18 are required for CENP-A loading and histone deacetylation at centromeres Here we report identification of five fission yeast centromere proteins, Mis14-18. Mis14 is recruited to kinetochores independently of CENP-A, and, conversely, CENP-A does not require Mis14 to associate with centromeres. In contrast, Mis15, Mis16 (strong similarity with human RbAp48 and RbAp46), Mis17, and Mis18 are all part of the CENP-A recruitment pathway. Mis16 and Mis18 form a complex and maintain the deacetylated state of histones specifically in the central core of centromeres. Mis16 and Mis18 are the most upstream factors in kinetochore assembly as they can associate with kinetochores in all kinetochore mutants except for mis18 and mis16, respectively.  The Mis18 complex, and, in particular, its member M18BP1 was shown to be essential for both incorporation and maintenance of CENP-A.  CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. Roles of Mis18α in epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin and CENP-A loading The Mis18 complex has been identified as a critical factor for the centromeric localization of a histone H3 variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A), which is responsible for the specification of centromere identity in the chromosome. Here, we generated Mis18α conditional knockout mice and found that Mis18α deficiency resulted in lethality at early embryonic stage with severe defects in chromosome segregation caused by mislocalization of CENP-A. Further, we demonstrate Mis18α's crucial role for epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin by reinforcing centromeric localization of DNMT3A/3B Mis18α interacts with DNMT3A/3B, and this interaction is critical for maintaining DNA methylation and hence regulating epigenetic states of centromeric chromatin Mis18α deficiency led to reduced DNA methylation, altered histone modifications, and uncontrolled noncoding transcripts in centromere region by decreased DNMT3A/3B enrichment Together, our findings uncover the functional mechanism of Mis18α and its pivotal role in mammalian cell cycle. Centromere licensing: Mis18 is required to Polo-ver The Mis18 complex is a critical player in determining when and where centromeres are built Its nearest relatives are yippee, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein of unknown function, and Mis18, a protein involved in the priming of centromeres for recruitment of CENP-A. Mis16 and Mis18 are subunits of a protein complex required for incorporation of the histone H3 variant CenH3 (Cnp1/CENP-A) into centromeric chromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals. The Mis18 proteins (Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1) are pivotal to the deposition of CENP-A at the centromere during cell cycle progression and are indispensable for embryonic development. Although Mis18α and Mis18β are highly homologous proteins, we find that their conserved YIPPEE domains mediate distinct interactions that are essential to link new CENP-A deposition to existing centromeres. Its nearest relatives are yippee, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein of unknown function, and Mis18, a protein involved in the priming of centromeres for recruitment of CENP-A. Ectopically targeted CENP-A chromatin at the LacO array was sufficient to direct the assembly of a functional centromere as indicated by the recruitment of the constitutive centromere-associated network proteins, the microtubule-binding protein NDC80, and the formation of stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Replication-independent incorporation of CENP-A at centromeres depends on its chaperone HJURP(Scm3), and Mis18 in vertebrates and fission yeast. Our findings suggest that Eic1 serves a function analogous to that of Mis18BP1(KNL2), thus representing the functional counterpart of Mis18BP1(KNL2) in fission yeast that connects with a module within the CCAN/Mis6/Ctf19 complex to allow the temporally regulated recruitment of the Mis18/Scm3(HJURP) Cnp1(CENP-A) loading factors. Here, we show that Mis18â, a component of Mis18 complex governing CENP-A localization, is a new substrate of âTrCP-containing SCF complex. Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromere protein Mis19 links Mis16 and Mis18 to recruit CENP-A through interacting with NMD factors and the SWI/SNF complex. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammalian Mis16 and Mis18 form a complex essential for CENP-A recruitment to centromeres.

Mis16 and Mis18 are required for CENP-A loading and histone deacetylation at centromeres. No Mis18BP1(KNL2) orthologue has been identified in fission yeast, consequently it remains unknown how the key Cnp1(CENP-A) loading factor Mis18 is recruited.  In contrast, Mis15, Mis16 (strong similarity with human RbAp48 and RbAp46), Mis17, and Mis18 are all part of the CENP-A recruitment pathway.  In fission yeast, Scm3sp and the Mis18 complex, composed of Mis16, Eic1, and Mis18, function as a CENP-A(Cnp1)-specific chaperone and a recruiting factor, respectively, and together ensure accurate delivery of CENP-A(Cnp1) to centromeres. Its nearest relatives are yippee, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein of unknown function, and Mis18, a protein involved in the priming of centromeres for recruitment of CENP-A.

CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the Mis18 complex and the CENP-A chaperone HJURP. We find that Mis18α directly interacts with the N terminus of Mis18BP1, whereas Mis18β directly interacts with CENP-C during G1 phase, revealing that these proteins have evolved to serve distinct functions in centromeres of higher eukaryotes.

Thus, CENP-C provides a link between existing CENP-A chromatin and the proteins required for new CENP-A nucleosome assembly.

This led to the identification of 11 prognostic lncRNAs. Functional analyses of this group uncovered LINC01089 (here renamed LncRNA Inhibiting Metastasis; LIMT), a highly conserved lncRNA, which is depleted in basal-like and in HER2-positive tumors, and the low expression of which predicts poor patient prognosis. Interestingly, EGF rapidly downregulates LIMT expression by enhancing histone deacetylation at the respective promoter.

58a0f95c78275d0c4a000055	What are prions?	Prion diseases are protein conformation disorders and neither caused by viroid or virus but is a transmissible particle labeled a prion by Pruisner. Normal prion protein becomes infectious by a different folding, but the triggers are not known.  Prions are proteins most commonly associated with fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but are also responsible for a number of harmless heritable phenotypes in yeast. These states arise when a misfolded form of a protein appears and, rather than be removed by cellular quality control mechanisms, persists. The misfolded prion protein forms aggregates and is capable of converting normally folded protein to the misfolded state through direct interaction between the two forms. Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the aggregation and deposition of the misfolded prion protein in the brain.  Several neurodegenerative diseases such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are caused by the conversion of cellular proteins to a pathogenic conformer.  Prions are self-propagating infectious protein isoforms. Prions are units of propagation of an altered state of a protein or proteins; prions can propagate from organism to organism, through cooption of other protein copies	['Prion diseases are protein conformation disorders and neither caused by viroid or virus but is a transmissible particle labeled a prion by Pruisner.

531b2fc3b166e2b80600003c	What is the prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure?	 Cumulative survival was significantly lower among patients with free triiodothyronine < 2.12 pg/mL and among patients with brain natriuretic peptide > 686 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the significant independent predictors of major cardiac events were age, free triiodothyronine, and brain natriuretic peptide The T3 was more meaningful than the BNP in the prognosis of CHF. The BNP and T3 combination detection was more valuable in determining the severity of CHF and prognosis. fT3 and BNP hold an independent and additive prognostic value in HF. Univariate regression analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4 (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained significantly associated with the events. Low T(3) levels are an independent predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, adding prognostic information to conventional clinical and functional cardiac parameters. Sixteen patients (14%) died during the follow-up period; their fT3/fT4 ratio was significantly lower than the patients who survived (1.31+/-0.37 vs. 2.01+/-0.72, p<0.001). The authors conclude that among elderly patients with heart failure, lower triiodothyronine concentrations are more prevalent and are associated with a worse prognosis. A low free T3 index/reverse T3 ratio is associated with poor ventricular function and nutritional status and is the strongest predictor yet identified for short-term outcome in patients with advanced heart failure.

In this article we identify for the first time explicitly the GA-sequences as a class of fractal genomic sequences that are easy to recognize and to extract, and are scattered densely throughout the chromosomes of a large number of genomes from different species and kingdoms including the human genome.  most GA-sequences [1] shared chains of tetra-GA-motifs and contained upstream poly(A)-segments. Although not integral parts of them, Alu-elements were found immediately upstream of all human and chimpanzee GA-sequences with an upstream poly(A)-segment The article hypothesizes that genome navigation uses these properties of GA-sequences in the following way The article describes DNA sequences of mammalian genomes that are longer than 50 bases, but consist exclusively of G's and A's ('pure GA-sequences'). Although their frequency of incidence should be 10(-16) or smaller, the chromosomes of human, chimpanzee, dog, cat, rat, and mouse contained many tens of thousands of them ubiquitously located along the chromosomes with a species-dependent density, reaching sizes of up to 1300 [b]. With the exception of a small number of poly-A-, poly-G-, poly-GA-, and poly-GAAA-sequences (combined<0.5%), all pure GA-sequences of the mammals tested were unique individuals, contained several repeated short GA-containing motifs, and shared a common hexa-nucleotide spectrum. At most 2% of the human GA-sequences were transcribed into mRNAs; all others were not coding for proteins Here we report that alpha d(GA) x d(GA) sequences form an antiparallel stranded duplex DNA at neutral pH. Alternating polypurine d(GA)n, sequences exhibit a considerable polymorphism Hence, guanine and thymine share significant properties regarding complementarity to adenine, while the TA and GA sequences can stack in at least two mutually compatible ways within the DNA duplexes analyzed here Implications of these results for an understanding of the molecular principles behind the conformational flexibility of alternating d(GA.TC)n sequences are discussed. The functions of pure GA-sequences are not known. Although not integral parts of them, Alu-elements were found immediately upstream of all human and chimpanzee GA-sequences with an upstream poly(A)-segment. Depending on the conditions, d(GA)n DNA sequences can form antiparallel-and parallel-stranded homoduplexes, multistranded complexes, and ordered single-stranded conformations. Introducing a new method to visualize large stretches of genomic DNA (see Appendix S1) the article reports that most GA-sequences [1] shared chains of tetra-GA-motifs and contained upstream poly(A)-segments. This observation demonstrates that homoduplexes of alternating GA and TA sequences can co-exist in a single DNA molecule. Duplexes of the dodeca-satellite purine-rich strand, carrying tandem 5'-GA:GA-3' mismatches, are as stable as equivalent fully Watson-Crick duplexes containing tandem 5'-TA:TA-3' Watson-Crick pairs in place of the non-Watson-Crick G.A pairs. With the exception of a small number of poly-A-, poly-G-, poly-GA-, and poly-GAAA-sequences (combined <0.5%), all pure GA-sequences of the mammals tested were unique individuals, contained several repeated short GA-containing motifs, and shared a common hexa-nucleotide spectrum. To discover safe and effective topical skin-lightening agents, we have evaluated alkyl esters of the natural product gentisic acid (GA), which is related to our lead compound methyl gentisate (MG), and four putative tyrosinase inhibitors, utilizing mammalian melanocyte cell cultures and cell-free extracts. Physicochemical characterization of the new structures and model building are consistent with, in the case of d(TC)n-d(GA)n, a tetra-stranded complex forming by the addition of d(GA)n to the remaining space in the major groove of the triple-stranded complex d(TC)n-d(GA)n-d(CT)n.

Three additional factors Pds5, Wapl, and Sororin bind to cohesin and modulate its dynamic association with chromatin. Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by cohesin and regulated by Sororin, is essential for chromosome segregation.  Sororin is a master regulator of sister chromatid cohesion and separation. The maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion from S phase to the onset of anaphase relies on a small but evolutionarily conserved protein called Sororin. Sororin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by antagonizing Wapl. Sororin is a positive regulator of sister chromatid cohesion that interacts with the cohesin complex.

Histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) protein is involved in Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4)-mediated transcriptional repression in hematopoietic stem cells we demonstrate that LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 (N. Meier et al., Development 133:4913-4923, 2006) in erythroid cells. We used a tagging strategy to show that RUNX1 interacts with two novel protein partners, LSD1 and MYEF2, in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells Lysine-specific demethylase 1 restricts hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and is essential for terminal differentiation LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain Gfi-1B p32 isoform binds to Gfi-1B target gene promoters and associates with the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex more efficiently than the major Gfi-1B p37 isoform Furthermore, we show that Gfi-1B includes a KSKK motif in its SNAG domain, which recruits the repressor complex only when dimethylated on lysine 8. Mutation of lysine 8 prevents Gfi-1B p32-induced erythroid development. Our results thus highlight a key role for the alternatively spliced Gfi-1B p32 isoform in erythroid development Dynamic interaction between TAL1 oncoprotein and LSD1 regulates TAL1 function in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis we reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation regulates TAL1 interaction with the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) that removes methyl group from methylated Lys 4 on histone H3 tails. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Knockdown of TAL1 or LSD1 led to a derepression of the TAL1 target genes in T-cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells, which is accompanied by elevating promoter H3K4 methylation. Similarly, treatment of PKA activator forskolin resulted in derepression of target genes by reducing its interaction with LSD1 while PKA inhibitor H89 represses them by suppressing H3K4 methylation levels. Consistent with the dual roles of TAL1 in transcription, TAL1-associated LSD1 is decreased while recruitment of hSET1 is increased at the TAL1 targets during erythroid differentiation TAL1 has recently been shown to differentially recruit LSD1 and other histone modifying complexes to regulate its target genes LSD1-mediated epigenetic modification is required for TAL1 function and hematopoiesis we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. Epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1 To elucidate the function of Gfi proteins, we purified Gfi-1b complexes and identified interacting proteins. Prominent among these is the corepressor CoREST, the histone demethylase LSD1, and HDACs 1 and 2. CoREST and LSD1 associate with Gfi-1/1b via the SNAG repression domain. Gfi-1b further recruits these cofactors to the majority of target gene promoters in vivo Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy. LSD1-mediated epigenetic modification is required for TAL1 function and hematopoiesis. Dynamic interaction between TAL1 oncoprotein and LSD1 regulates TAL1 function in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1-LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) protein is involved in Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4)-mediated transcriptional repression in hematopoietic stem cells. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy.

Furthermore, RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 in erythroid cells. RUNX1 interacts with LSD1 and MYEF2 in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells. Finally, LSD1 also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF.']

533c3571c45e133714000005	How are lincRNA affecting the regulation of gene expression?	We detected a considerable number of cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) and demonstrated that the genetic regulation of lincRNA expression is independent of the regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Wang et al. (2013) find that linc-RoR maintains human embryonic stem cell self-renewal by functioning as a sponge to trap miR-145, thus regulating core pluripotency factors Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 Enrichment of expressed lincRNA promoters in enhancer marks provides an additional argument for the involvement of lincRNAs in the regulation of transcription in cis.  Together, these findings suggest that lincRNA-p21 is an important player in the regulation of the Warburg effect and also implicate lincRNA-p21 as a valuable therapeutic target for cancer. Our findings implicate a novel RNA gene, lincRNA AC068718.1, as risk factor for PTSD in women and add to emerging evidence that non-coding RNA genes may play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of gene regulation with putative pathological effects that lead to phenotypic differences.

To address this concern, bispecific or trispecific engagers that target NK cells to the tumour and an ADAM17 inhibitor that prevents CD16 shedding after NK cell activation are being tested ese findings support ADAM17 as a dynamic inhibitory checkpoint of the potent activating receptor CD16A, which can be targeted by MEDI3622 to potentially increase the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutic antibodie Our findings provide further characterization of CD16 cleavage by ADAM17 and they demonstrate that a non-cleavable version of CD16a can be expressed in engineered NK cells. CD16a and CD16b are IgG Fc receptors expressed by human natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils, respectively. Both CD16 isoforms undergo a rapid down-regulation in expression by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon cell activation by various stimuli.

5e481b2cd14c9f295d00000a	What is known about ROS production in relation to UVR?	Human skin exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in a dramatic increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have shown that skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus altering the cellular function.  Skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, and alteration of fibroblasts and collagen responsible for skin photoaging. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure causes various injurious effects to human skin by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS production can lead to oxidative stress which may damage cellular components like lipids and proteins and causing photoaging. Skin damage induced by UVR is an escalating problem in dermatology, and increasing incidence of skin cancer, especially for non-melanoma skin cancer, has been reported worldwide. UVR from sun exposure and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be a pivotal factor in the aetiology of skin cancer. Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) derived from solar light causes skin damage by causing DNA lesions and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes and other epidermal cells.

Onychomycosis is a common infection of the nail unit that is usually caused by a dermatophyte (tinea unguium) and most frequently affects toenails in adults skin infections with dermatophytes such as tinea pedis and tinea corporis, Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. The term "tinea incognita" refers to diverse clinical presentation of mycotic infections modified by inappropriate use of topical or systemic corticosteroids Dermatophyte infections are common at all ages, in both sexes, and they have a worldwide distribution. These infections include tinea capitis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea manuum and tinea barbae. Tinea versicolor, caused by Malassezia furfur, Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the skin and the hair with involvement of the hair shaft and the pilosebaceous unit. The genus Trichophyton gives rise to most of the tinea dermatophytoses, including tinea capitis, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis).  For the men, onychomycosis (nail fungus, 31.5%), tinea pedis (foot fungus, 27.8%), and acne (24.1 %) were the most commonly diagnosed skin diseases, with contact dermatitis diagnosed in 5.6% of the sample A statistical 30-year study of dermatomycosis in Sendai National Hospital (1968-1997) revealed many changes in the prevalent diseases: Tinea pedis and tinea unguium constantly increased during this period, and the ratio of the former associated with nail infection finally reached 30% of all tinea pedis patients Eighty percent of the examined boys were with unless one skin disease. Tinea capitis (42.66%), scabiosis (13.33%), pyoderma (15.33%), plantar keratodermia (100%) were the skin diseases. Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection that occurs mainly in childhood; Tinea pedis is a chronic fungal infection of the feet, very often observed in patients who are immuno-suppressed or have diabetes mellitus. Tinea infections are caused by dermatophytes and are classified by the involved site. The most common infections in prepubertal children are tinea corporis and tinea capitis, whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to develop tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (onychomycosis). The most frequent diseases observed at arrival were dermatological conditions. Of the adoptees, 70% presented at least one skin disease, of which 57.5% were infectious; Tinea capitis being the most frequent (n = 42). The recovery rate of Tinea capitis was 89% (n = 32/36).

Filgotinib (GLPG0634/GS-6034), an oral selective JAK1 inhibitor, is effective as monotherapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: results from a randomised, dose-finding study (DARWIN 2). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and previous inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) Over 24 weeks, filgotinib as monotherapy was efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of active RA, with a rapid onset of action. Filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) is a once-daily, orally administered, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-selective inhibitor. The FITZROY study examined the efficacy and safety of filgotinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. In the intention-to-treat population, 60 (47%) of 128 patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission at week 10 versus ten (23%) of 44 patients treated with placebo (difference 24 percentage points [95% CI 9-39], p=0·0077). In a pooled analysis of all periods of filgotinib and placebo exposure over 20 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were reported in 14 (9%) of 152 patients treated with filgotinib and three (4%) of 67 patients treated with placebo.

5d3840257bc3fee31f000011	Which is the function of the PRDM9 protein in mammals?	Developmental progress of germ cells through meiotic phases is closely tied to ongoing meiotic recombination. In mammals, recombination preferentially occurs in genomic regions known as hotspots; the protein that activates these hotspots is PRDM9, In mammals, genetic recombination during meiosis is limited to a set of 1- to 2-kb regions termed hotspots. Their locations are predominantly determined by the zinc finger protein PRDM9, which binds to DNA in hotspots Meiotic recombination ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes and creates genetic variation. In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9) These results, which provide the first detailed mapping of PRDM9 binding to DNA and, to our knowledge, the most detailed analysis yet of DNA binding by a long zinc-finger array, make clear that the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex. PRDM9 is a major determinant of meiotic recombination hotspots in humans and mice.  Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene. During mammalian meiosis, double-strand breaks are deliberately made throughout the genome and then repaired, leading to the exchange of genetic material between copies of chromosomes. How the locations of breaks are specified was largely unknown until a fortuitous confluence of statistical genetics and molecular biology uncovered the role of PRDM9, a DNA binding protein In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination. These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process.

56f3f2072ac5ed1459000018	What is the basis of the methodology of "functional class scoring" (FCS) for the analysis of gene expression data?	The second method, "functional class scoring" (FCS), examines the statistical distribution of individual gene scores among all genes in the gene ontology class and does not involve an initial gene selection step. We aimed at examining such discrepancies on the level of apparently affected biologically related groups of genes, e.g. metabolic or signalling pathways. This can be achieved by group testing procedures, e.g. over-representation analysis, functional class scoring (FCS), or global tests. They also suggest that functional class scoring methods appear to perform better and more consistently than overrepresentation analysis and distributional score methods. With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the significance of the impact of D3T treatment. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods)  There are three main classes of these methods: over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology based methods. Here, we show that all three major categories of pathway analysis methods (enrichment analysis, functional class scoring, and topology-based methods) are severely influenced by crosstalk phenomena Proteomics Expansion Pipeline (PEP), Functional Class Scoring (FCS), and Maxlink, in a test scenario of valproic acid (VPA)-treated mice. We propose and examine personalized extensions of pathway statistics, overrepresentation analysis and functional class scoring, to generate individualized pathway aberrance score. The comparison of two analytical approaches, based on either Over Representation Analysis or Functional Class Scoring, by a meta-analysis-based approach, led to the retrieval of known information about the biological situation - thus validating the model - but also more importantly to the discovery of the previously unknown implication of the spliceosome, the cellular machinery responsible for mRNA splicing, in the development of metastasis.

The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to its cognate binding sites.  the PRDM9 variant associated with hotspot activity binds specifically to DNA sequences located at the center of the three hotspots tested.   In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a long-array zinc-finger and chromatin-modifier protein. the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex. We also find that human PRDM9 frequently binds promoters, despite their low recombination rates, and it can activate expression of a small number of genes including CTCFL and VCX. The long zinc finger domain of PRDM9 forms a highly stable and long-lived complex with its DNA recognition sequence. In mammals, meiotic recombination occurs at 1- to 2-kb genomic regions termed hotspots, whose positions and activities are determined by PRDM9, a DNA-binding histone methyltransferase.  In mice and humans, the location of these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain.

Holoprosencephaly is the most common malformation of the forebrain and typically results in severe neurocognitive impairment with accompanying midline facial anomalies. Holoprosencephaly is a rare brain abnormality resulting from an incomplete cleavage of the primitive prosencephalon of forebrain during early embryogenesis. Holoprosencephaly is a brain malformation that develops as a result of a defect in development of prosencephalon during early gestation. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Holoprosencephaly is a disorder of forebrain development characterized by a failure of the brain to separate into two hemispheres during early development. Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a severe brain malformation characterized by abnormal cleavage of the prosencephalon in the 5th gestational week. Holoprosencephaly is a brain defect resulting from incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain. Holoprosencephaly is a spectrum of congenital defects of forebrain development characterized by incomplete separation of the cerebral hemispheres. Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated extracranial, symptomatic abnormalities in only a minority of cases.

56bf5b0cef6e394741000014	What is the role of music therapy in coma patients.	[Beneficial effect of preferred music on cognitive functions in minimally conscious state patients]. Several studies have shown that music can boost cognitive functions in normal and brain-damaged subjects. A few studies have suggested a beneficial effect of music in patients with a disorder of consciousness but it is difficult to conclude since they did not use quantified measures and a control condition/group.  . This new protocol suggests that preferred music has a beneficial effect on the cognitive abilities of MCS patients.  This review presents an overview of the use of music therapy in neurological early rehabilitation of patients with coma and other disorders of consciousness (DOC) such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) or minimally conscious state (MCS).  The programs' content consisted of recreation and communication options, which involved activating music, videos, and basic requests, sending and receiving (listening to) text messages, and placing phone calls.  Active music therapy in the rehabilitation of severe brain injured patients during coma recovery. Active improvised music therapy may offer an adjuvant from of treatment in the early rehabilitation of severe brain-injured patients. Our preliminary results show a significant improvement of the collaboration of the severe brain-injured patients and a reduction of undesired behaviours such as inertia (reduced psychomotor initiative) or psychomotor agitation. Hence, it is possible for music therapy to both establish contact with the seemingly non-responsive patient and re-stimulate the person's fundamental communication competencies and experience at the emotional, social and cognitive levels. Six studies focused on the provision of multisensory stimulation or music therapy.

58af14ae717cd3f655000001	How does Ssu72 mediate gene looping?	Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, "gene looping" factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome. Furthermore, different regions of Pta1 interact with the CPF subunits Ssu72, Pti1, and Ysh1, supporting the idea that Pta1 acts as a scaffold to organize CPF. The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing The first 300 amino acids of Pta1 are sufficient for interactions with Ssu72, which is needed for pre-mRNA cleavage.  These findings suggest that the amino terminus of Pta1 has an inhibitory effect and that this effect can be neutralized through the interaction with Ssu72. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP.  These interactions are transcription-dependent, require the Ssu72 and Pta1 components of the CPF 3'-end processing complex, and require the phosphatase activity of Ssu72. We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and terminator regions are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation. The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. The pta1-Delta75 mutant is defective for snoRNA termination, RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Ser5-P dephosphorylation, and gene looping but is fully functional for mRNA 3'-end processing.  We conclude that Swd2.2 opposes condensin-mediated chromosome condensation by facilitating the function of the two CPF-associated phosphatases PP1 and Ssu72. Based on the interactions of Ssu72 and Sub1 with both the Pta1 of CPF and the TFIIB component of the initiation complex, we present a model describing how these novel connections between the transcription and 3' end processing machineries might facilitate transitions in the RNAP II transcription cycle. By the degron-mediated depletion of Pta1, we show that the removal of this essential region leads to a loss of Ssu72, yet surprisingly, in vitro cleavage and polyadenylation remain efficient. The pta1-Delta75 mutant is defective for snoRNA termination, RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Ser5-P dephosphorylation, and gene looping but is fully functional for mRNA 3'-end processing.

58e115d66fddd3e83e00000a	What are congenital disorders of glycosylation?	Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), formerly representing a group of diseases due to defects in the biosynthetic pathway of protein N-glycosylation, currently covers a wide range of disorders affecting glycoconjugates.  Congenital disorders of glycosylation form a rapidly growing group of inherited metabolic diseases. As glycosylation affects proteins all over the organism, a mutation in a single gene leads to a multisystemic disorder. Glycosylation is an integral part in health and disease, as emphasized by the growing number of identified glycosylation defects. In humans, proteins are modified with a diverse range of glycoforms synthesized in complex biosynthetic pathways. Glycosylation disorders have been described in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) as well as in acquired disease conditions such and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A hallmark in a subset of CDG cases is the reduced glycosylation site occupancy of asparagine-linked glycans.  Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a growing group of inherited metabolic disorders where enzymatic defects in the formation or processing of glycolipids and/or glycoproteins lead to variety of different diseases.  More than 100 rare human genetic disorders that result from deficiencies in the different glycosylation pathways are known today.  The patients have hundreds of misglycosylated products, which afflict a myriad of processes, including cell signaling, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration.

52f89a002059c6d71c00004c	Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome	Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Intravenous iron administration, especially in those requiring treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is an essential component of the management of anemia in ESRD patients. Iron improves hemoglobin, reduces ESA dose requirement and also has nonerythropoietic effects including improvement in physical performance, cognition and amelioration of restless leg syndrome. The dopamine transporter is decreased in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome. RLS subjects had significantly lower DAT binding in the striatum compared to controls on both the Day and the Night scans. Secondary RLS is a complication of PD. Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients. Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron  Iron deficiency is associated with paediatric sleep disturbances; in particular, restless leg syndrome (RLS) Here we described seven pediatric RLS patients. All of the parents of our patients had difficult times to make their children sleep due to irritability, restlessness, and demanding bedtime routines. All patients had asked their parents to rub their feet in bed, and it took more than half an hour to soothe them until they fell asleep. Their mothers had been exhausted from this night-time routine. However, they did not consider the routine abnormal, as it had been their habitual behavior since infancy. Some parents were too distressed or embarrassed to describe the symptoms of their child properly. Five patients had clear family history and none had obvious periodic leg movements during sleep. All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain.  Restless leg syndrome manifested by iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome.  The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy.  Clinical, EEG, electromyographic and polysomnographic studies in restless legs syndrome caused by magnesium deficiency.	['Iron deficiency (low serum ferritin) is a recognized cause for RLS. Further, in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome, the dopamine transporter is decreased, which leads to impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission. There is also a report of magnesium deficiency underlying RLS.']
5a74e6eb0384be9551000009	What is Morgellons disease?	"Morgellons disease" has been a controversial topic in the history of psychodermatology. The most consensual scientific opinion is that it is a primary psychiatric disorder, particularly, a delusional disorder, although others were also pointed out. Some authors have suggested that it may correspond to a common dermatosis with secondary psychopathology. Morgellons disease is a rare disease with unknown etiology In recent years, there has been a reported increase in affliction of the skin with small fibres or other particles. The condition has been referred to as Morgellons disease. Patients present with stinging, burning or crawling sensations of the skin, with perceived extrusion of inanimate material alongside fatigue and other systemic symptoms. Sufferers often experience significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life. including delusional infestation, Morgellons syndrome,  Morgellons disease (MD) is a dermopathy characterized by multicolored filaments that lie under, are embedded in, or project from skin. Although MD was initially considered to be a delusional disorder, recent studies have demonstrated that the dermopathy is associated with tickborne infection, that the filaments are composed of keratin and collagen, and that they result from proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in epithelial tissue.  Morgellons disease (MD) is a complex skin disorder characterized by ulcerating lesions that have protruding or embedded filaments. Many clinicians refer to this condition as delusional parasitosis or delusional infestation and consider the filaments to be introduced textile fibers. In contrast, recent studies indicate that MD is a true somatic illness associated with tickborne infection, that the filaments are keratin and collagen in composition and that they result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the skin Morgellons is a medically contested diagnosis with foremost dermatological symptoms. Patients experience fibers emerging from the skin, together with a range of other somatic, psychiatric, and neurological complaints. Morgellons Disease is a condition involving painful skin lesions, fibrous growths protruding from the skin, and subcutaneous stinging and burning sensations, along with symptoms of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and memory and attention deficits. Morgellons disease is an emerging skin disease characterized by formation of dermal filaments associated with multisystemic symptoms and tick-borne illness. Morgellons disease is characterized by complaints of uncomfortable skin sensations and fibers emanating from nonhealing skin lesions. Morgellons disease is a controversial and poorly defined symptom cluster of skin lesions and somatic symptoms, most notably 'fibers' in the skin. Morgellons disease is a psycho-dermatologic condition in which patients report fibers or filaments "growing" out of their skin. Morgellons disease is an infrequent syndromic condition, that typically affects middle-aged white women, characterized by crawling sensations on and under the skin, associated with itchy rashes, stinging sores, fiber-like filaments emerging from the sores, severe fatigue, concentrating difficulty, and memory loss. Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding Morgellons disease is a mysterious skin disorder that was first described more than 300 years ago. The disease is characterized by fiber-like strands extruding from the skin in conjunction with various dermatologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms.	['It is a skin condition in which individuals have skin lesions that contain some kind of fibers. Patients often complain of bugs crawling under their skin. The disease is of unknown origin and may be psychosomatic, however recent evidence indicates it could be transmitted by a tick.']

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR has been successfully utilised to efficiently correct the Cdh23 (ahl) allele in C57BL/6NTac mice, and rescue the associated auditory phenotype. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to genetically correct the MYO15A mutation in the iPSCs and rescued the morphology and function of the derived hair cell-like cells.  Our recent work has shown CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear in vivo.

603bc1a81cb411341a000159	Can you summarize Myasthenia Gravis?	Myasthenia gravis is a rare and invalidating disease affecting the neuromuscular junction of voluntary muscles. The classical form of this autoimmune disease is characterized by the presence of antibodies against the most abundant protein in the neuromuscular junction, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) are the most common disorders of neuromuscular transmission in clinical practice. Disorders of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are characterized by fluctuating and fatigable weakness and include autoimmune, toxic, and genetic conditions. Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies are formed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or other components of the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscular weakness and fatigability. Myasthenia Gravis is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder generaly thought to be caused by an antibody-mediated attack against the skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction.  INTRODUCTION: myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular junction disorder that can jeopardize the patient's life and has a high clinical polymorphism that makes it difficult to diagnose.PATIENTS AND Myasthenia that affects children can be classified into the following 3 forms: transient neonatal myasthenia, congenital myasthenic syndromes, and juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG).

54f08fa494afd61504000017	What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?	RESULTS: Right 2D:4D was not associated with TGCT [odds ratio (OR) for a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in right-hand 2D:4D: 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.34]. The results were consistent when evaluating the association based on the left hand. The difference between right and left-hand 2D:4D was also not associated with TGCT risk [OR for a one-SD increase in ΔR-L: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23].  Digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with gastric cancer. RESULTS: GCA group presented significantly higher left 2D:4D, but significantly lower R-L in comparison to healthy controls, particularly so for males. Digit ratio did not correlate to clinical staging or TNM staging. The 2D:4D pattern found for gastric cancer parallels that earlier described for breast cancer. Higher second fourth digit ratio predicts higher incidence of prostate cancer in prostate biopsy. 2D/4D ratio >0,95 (OR (CI 95%) 4,4 (1,491-13,107) was related to neoplasia.  CONCLUSION: High digit ratio predicts PCa in men undergoing prostate biopsy. Digit ratio >0,95 has 4-fold risk of PCa compared to men with digit ratio ≤0.95. RESULTS: African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio. CONCLUSION: 2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer.  RESULTS: We found a direct association between left 2D:4D and breast cancer risk, an inverse association between Δ(r-l) and risk of breast cancer, but no association between right 2D:4D and breast cancer risk. Among breast cancer cases, both right 2D:4D and Δ(r-l) were inversely associated with age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer. Recent studies have reported a strong association between 2D:4D and risk of prostate cancer.  RESULTS: No association was observed between 2D:4D and prostate cancer risk overall (HRs 1.00; 95% CIs, 0.92-1.08 for right, 0.93-1.08 for left).  CONCLUSION: Our results are not consistent with an association between 2D:4D and overall prostate cancer risk, but we cannot exclude a weak inverse association between 2D:4D and early onset prostate cancer risk. Males in the OSCC group presented significantly higher digit ratio (P = 0.03) in comparison with males with OPLs and individuals without oral lesions. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, males with the higher digit ratio seem to be more prone to undergo malignization of lesions in the oral cavity.  Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSION: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk. In the case-control analysis (n = 263), after controlling for ethnicity, women who developed CIN were significantly more likely to have a higher 2D:4D compared with HPV-negative women. A similar, nonsignificant trend was observed among women with a persistent HPV infection. CONCLUSION: Lower fetal androgen exposure may predispose to persistent HPV and increased risk of CIN. Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer.  Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer. A lower digit ratio is related to an increased detection rate of prostate cancer, a high percentage of core cancer volume and a high Gleason score.  Digit ratio could act as a possible marker for cancer predisposition. Right hand digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with oral cancer. CONCLUSION: Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer. Second to fourth digit ratio: a predictor of prostate-specific antigen level and the presence of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a lower digit ratio have higher risks of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer. Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as breast cancer and myocardial infarction. Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer. Findings from AR studies predict that low 2D:4D will be associated with prostate and hepatocellular cancer, urolithiasis, ADHD, ankylosing spondylitis, spontaneous abortion, and polycystic ovaries, while high 2D:4D will be associated with motor neuron diseases and endometrial cancer. We found a direct association between left 2D:4D and breast cancer risk, an inverse association between Δ(r-l) and risk of breast cancer, but no association between right 2D:4D and breast cancer risk Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer The 2D:4D pattern found for gastric cancer parallels that earlier described for breast cancer	['Digit ratio (2D:4D) is associated with gastric cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma. 2D:4D was found to be higher in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and prostate cancer  patients relative to controls.

58ede257eda5a57672000010	What is the genetic basis of the Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS)?	Circadian gene mutations are also associated with circadian rhythm disorders such as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome.  Possible association of human leucocyte antigen DR1 with delayed sleep phase syndrome. The study investigated the human leucocyte antigen (HLA), types A, B and DR, of 42 patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and compared the frequencies of the antigens with those in 117 healthy controls. The comparison revealed that the gene frequencies and positivities of HLA-A, -B and -DR, except for DR1, had no significant differences between the patients and controls. The frequency of HLA-DR1 was increased in the DSPS patients as compared with that in the healthy controls (P = 0.0069 in positivity). In human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, the incidence of DR1 positivity alone was significantly higher in DSPS patients than in healthy subjects.  Recent progress in biological clock research has facilitated genetic analysis of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome (N-24) Association of structural polymorphisms in the human period3 gene with delayed sleep phase syndrome. One of the haplotypes was significantly associated with DSPS (Bonferroni's corrected P = 0.037; odds ratio = 7.79; 95% CI 1.59-38.3) in our study population. Our results suggest that structural polymorphisms in the hPer3 gene may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DSPS. A length polymorphism in the circadian clock gene Per3 is linked to delayed sleep phase syndrome and extreme diurnal preference. Polymorphisms in the CLOCK, BMAL1, Per3 and TIMELESS genes have been associated with susceptibility to mood disorder, and single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in several circadian genes have been observed among those displaying certain circadian phenotypes, including worse mood in the evening, insomnia in mania and early, middle or late insomnia in depression.  To investigate the link between extreme diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and a length polymorphism in Per3 The Per3 polymorphism correlated significantly with extreme diurnal preference, the longer allele associating with morningness and the shorter allele with eveningness. The shorter allele was strongly associated with the delayed sleep phase syndrome patients, 75% of whom were homozygous. We studied the association between the AA-NAT gene and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). Results indicate that there is a significant difference in allele positivity at the single nucleotide polymorphism involved in an amino acid substitution from alanine to threonine at position 129 between patients with DSPS and healthy controls. The frequency of the 129 threonine allele is significantly higher in the patients than in the controls ( P=0.0029). The data suggest that AA-NAT could be a susceptibility gene for DSPS. Our results suggest that latitude has a role in the influence of hPer3 gene polymorphism on delayed sleep-phase syndrome and confirm previous data showing its association with morningness-eveningness tendencies.

Inn1 and Cyk3 regulate chitin synthase during cytokinesis in budding yeasts Our data support a model in which the C2-domain of Inn1 acts in conjunction with Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of Chs2 during cytokinesis. Cdc14-dependent dephosphorylation of Inn1 contributes to Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation Cdc14 colocalizes with Inn1 at the cell division site and interacts with the C-terminal proline-rich domain of Inn1 that mediates its binding to the SH3-domain-containing proteins Hof1 and Cyk3. We show that phosphorylation of Inn1 by Cdk1 partially perturbs the interaction of Inn1 with Cyk3 thereby reducing the levels of Cyk3 at the cell division site. We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis Targeted localization of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 by the mitotic-exit network regulates cytokinesis in budding yeast Cyk3 acts in actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis by recruiting Inn1 to the yeast bud neck Role of Inn1 and its interactions with Hof1 and Cyk3 in promoting cleavage furrow and septum formation in S. cerevisiae we identified a novel factor that we call Inn1, which associates with the contractile actomyosin ring at the end of mitosis and is needed for cytokinesis. We show that Inn1 has a C2 domain at the amino terminus of the protein that is required for ingression of the plasma membrane, whereas the remainder of the protein recruits Inn1 to the actomyosin ring  Our data indicate that recruitment of the C2 domain of Inn1 to the contractile actomyosin ring is crucial for ingression of the plasma membrane during cytokinesis in budding yeast We previously found that the C2-domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Inn1 protein plays an essential but uncharacterised role at the cleavage site during cytokinesis. We propose that Cdc14 counteracts Cdk1 phosphorylation of Inn1 to facilitate Inn1-Cyk3 complex formation and so promote cytokinesis. Inn1 and Cyk3 regulate chitin synthase during cytokinesis in budding yeasts. Cyk3 acts in actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis by recruiting Inn1 to the yeast bud neck. Inn1 couples contraction of the actomyosin ring to membrane ingression during cytokinesis in budding yeast. Targeted localization of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 by the mitotic-exit network regulates cytokinesis in budding yeast. We therefore propose that the MEN directly controls cytokinesis via targeting of Inn1, Cyk3 and Chs2 to the bud neck. Our data support a model in which the C2-domain of Inn1 acts in conjunction with Cyk3 to regulate the catalytic domain of Chs2 during cytokinesis. In addition to compensating for mutations in the Inn1 C2-domain, the dominant CHS2 alleles suppress cytokinesis defects produced by the lack of the Cyk3 protein. We propose that Cyk3 is part of an actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis pathway, which acts as a rescue mechanism to recruit Inn1 to the bud neck. We previously found that the C2-domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Inn1 protein plays an essential but uncharacterised role at the cleavage site during cytokinesis. We propose that Cyk3 is part of an actomyosin ring independent cytokinesis pathway, which acts as a rescue mechanism to recruit Inn1 to the bud neck. The Inn1 C-terminal region is necessary for localization, and distinct PXXP motifs in this region mediate functionally important interactions with SH3 domains in the cytokinesis proteins Hof1 (an F-BAR protein) and Cyk3 (whose overexpression can restore PS formation in inn1Delta cells).

Molecular and biochemical characteristics of a gene encoding an alcohol acyl-transferase involved in the generation of aroma volatile esters during melon ripening. we conclude that CM-AAT1 plays a major role in aroma volatiles formation in the melon. Volatile esters, a major class of compounds contributing to the aroma of many fruit, are synthesized by alcohol acyl-transferases (AAT). The expression of all Cm-AAT genes is up-regulated during ripening and inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene.  The AAT1 locus is critical for the biosynthesis of esters contributing to 'ripe apple' flavour in 'Royal Gala' and 'Granny Smith' apples.

553d0c1df321868558000014	What is transvection?	An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells. At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals Pairing-dependent interallelic complementation was first described for the Ultrabithorax gene of the bithorax-complex in Drosophila by Lewis and cited as an example of a new phenomenon that Lewis called the "trans-vection effect." Several different kinds of pairing-dependent gene expression have been observed in Drosophila, and it is now clear that a variety of different molecular mechanisms probably underlie the changes in gene expression that are observed after disrupting chromosome pairing. Transvection in the bithorax-complex appears to result from the ability of cis-regulatory elements to regulate transcription of the promoter on the homologous chromosome. The same phenomenon appears to be responsible for pairing-dependent interallelic complementation at numerous other genes in Drosophila. Some transvection effects are dependent on the presence of wild-type or specific mutant forms of the protein encoded by the zeste trans-regulatory gene, but other transvection effects are zeste-independent. The ease with which chromosome aberrations can disrupt transvection also varies widely among different genes The presence of homologous nucleic acid sequences can exert profound effects on chromosomal and gene function in a wide range of organisms. These homology effects reveal remarkable forms of regulation as well as suggest possible avenues for the development of new technologies Enhancers have been defined operationally as cis-regulatory sequences that can stimulate transcription of RNA polymerase-II-transcribed genes over large distances and even when located downstream of the gene. Recently, it has become evident that enhancers can also stimulate transcription in trans if they are brought into close proximity to the promoter/gene. These reports provide clues to the mechanism of remote enhancer action. In addition, the findings, together with genetic studies in Drosophila, strongly suggest that enhancer action in trans could underlie phenomena such as 'transvection', where one chromosome affects gene expression in the paired homolog Numerous genes contain regulatory elements located many tens of kilobases away from the promoter they control. Specific mechanisms must be required to ensure that such distant elements can find and interact with their proper targets but not with extraneous genes. This review explores the connections between transvection phenomena, the activation of domains of homeotic gene expression, position effect variegation and silencers. These various examples of long-distance effects suggest that, in all cases, related forms of chromatin packaging may be involved The zeste locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding protein that can influence transcription. A number of sites recognized by this protein fall within genes associated with transvection, a phenomenon suggesting a form of gene regulation that is responsive to the proximity of a gene to its homologous allele on another chromosome Special attention is paid to the transvection effect (synapsis-dependent interaction between white and zeste genes), cis-acting regulatory elements and the behaviour of the white genes introduced into the genome by P element-mediated DNA transformation	['An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells.

5162af0f298dcd4e51000045	What is the role of deadenylases in the cell?	Deadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA is a mechanism critical for mRNA function by influencing mRNA turnover and efficiency of protein synthesis. In short, PARN is a divalent metal-ion dependent poly(A)-specific, processive and cap-interacting 3'-5' exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs. Distinct roles of the R3H and RRM domains in poly(A)-specific ribonuclease structural integrity and catalysis. Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product. Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain. miRNA-mediated deadenylation is orchestrated by GW182 through two conserved motifs that interact with CCR4-NOT. The rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation is the removal of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases. Purified PUM complexes were found to contain subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complex, which contains multiple enzymes that catalyze mRNA deadenylation. These findings demonstrate a conserved mechanism of PUF-mediated repression via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. The activity and selectivity of fission yeast Pop2p are affected by a high affinity for Zn2+ and Mn2+ in the active site. In eukaryotic organisms, initiation of mRNA turnover is controlled by progressive shortening of the poly-A tail, a process involving the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and its two associated 3'-5' exonucleases, Ccr4p and Pop2p (Caf1p). Here, we show biochemically and structurally that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Pop2p prefers Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) over Mg(2+) at the concentrations of the ions found inside cells and that the identity of the ions in the active site affects the activity of the enzyme. The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on virtually all mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as "deadenylation." Deadenylation is a widespread means of controlling mRNA stability and translation. Dynamic changes of the lengths of mRNA poly(A) tails are catalysed by diverse deadenylase enzymes. In eukaryotes, shortening of the 3'-poly(A) tail is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of most mRNAs, and two major mRNA deadenylase complexes--Caf1-Ccr4 and Pan2-Pan3--play central roles in this process, referred to as deadenylation. Previously, we demonstrated that eukaryotic releasing factor eRF3 mediates deadenylation and decay of mRNA in a manner coupled to translation termination. PUF protein-mediated deadenylation is catalyzed by Ccr4p. Deadenylation of mRNA is often the first and rate-limiting step in mRNA decay. PARN, a poly(A)-specific 3' --> 5' ribonuclease which is conserved in many eukaryotes, has been proposed to be primarily responsible for such a reaction, yet the importance of the PARN function at the whole-organism level has not been demonstrated in any species. The trypanosomal deadenylase activity is a 3'-->5' exonuclease specific for adenylate residues, generates 5'-AMP as a product, is magnesium dependent, and is inhibited by neomycin B sulfate. Identification of multiple RNA features that influence CCR4 deadenylation activity. The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA. PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells. Thus, deadenylation and the participating deadenylases are not simply required for preparing mRNA substrates; they play an indispensable role both structurally and functionally in P-body formation and regulation. In this context, the wide repertoire of RBPs and molecules that regulate PARN activity, together with the established role of deadenylases in miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA expression, suggest that mRNA turnover is more complex than it was previously thought and PARN holds a key role in this process. A set of multiple poly(A)-specific deadenylases has been identified, some, if not most, of which are likely to play a role in the key first step of mRNA turnover--the regulated shortening of the poly(A) tail.

CR- B cells responded with a delay of approximately 24 hr as compared with the response of CR+ B cells. The implications to the ontogenetic status of CR+ and CR- B subpopulations are discussed  After addition of culture supernatant from BCG-activated macrophages CR- B cells cooperate with both unprimed and primed T helper cells. CR- B cells cooperate with primed but not with unprimed T cells provided macrophages are added to cultures SR/CR (spontaneous regression/complete resistance) mouse model in which natural resistance to a variety of cancer types appeared to be inherited in SR/CR strains of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice The cancer resistance against S180 sarcoma cells could be transferred to susceptible non-resistant BALB/c mice as well as C57BL/6 mice after depletion of both CD4+/CD8+ leukocytes and B-cells from SR/CR mice. The SR/CR mouse phenotype, first described in 1999 in BALB/c and later bred into C57BL/6 mice, is resistant to cancer formation following high doses of cancer cells administered intraperitoneally.

51716fd38ed59a060a00000c	What is the role of  chromomethylases in plants?	Dual binding of chromomethylase domains to H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes directs DNA methylation in plants. CHG methylation by CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) depends on histone H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), but the mechanism underlying this relationship is poorly understood. Here, we report multiple lines of evidence that CMT3 interacts with H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes. CMT3 genome locations nearly perfectly correlated with H3K9me2, and CMT3 stably associated with H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes. A role for CHROMOMETHYLASE3 in mediating transposon and euchromatin silencing during egg cell reprogramming in Arabidopsis. We also demonstrated that CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) is required for H3K9 dimethylation in the egg cell and for normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote. Subsequent analysis of CMT3 mutants points to a key role in egg cell reprogramming by controlling silencing in both transposon and euchromatic regions. A speculative model of the CMT3-induced egg cell silencing is presented here, based on these results and current data from the literature suggesting the potential involvement of small RNAs targeted to the egg cell, a process conceptually similar to the division of labor described in the male gametophyte for which we show that H3K9 modifications and TFL2 localization are reminiscent of the female gametophyte. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp. In this study, we investigated the functional targets of the maize chromomethylase ZMET2 in multiple inbred lines to determine whether epigenetic changes conditioned by this chromomethylase are conserved or variable within the species. Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes. However, at the SUPERMAN locus, asymmetric methylation was only completely abolished in drm1 drm2 chromomethylase 3 (cmt3) triple mutant plants. The drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants did not affect CpG methylation at any locus tested, suggesting that the primary CpG methylases are encoded by the MET1 class of genes. Although neither the drm1 drm2 double mutants nor the cmt3 single mutants show morphological defects, drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants show pleiotropic effects on plant development. Our results suggest that the DRM and CMT3 genes act in a partially redundant and locus-specific manner to control asymmetric and CpNpG methylation. Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Maize chromomethylase Zea methyltransferase2 is required for CpNpG methylation. The sequence of ZMET2 is similar to that of the Arabidopsis chromomethylases CMT1 and CMT3, with C-terminal motifs characteristic of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases. Our research shows that chromomethylase Zmet2 is required for in vivo methylation of CpNpG sequences. Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene. The cmt3 mutants displayed enhanced expression and reduced methylation of the reporter, particularly at non-CG cytosines. CNG methylation was also reduced at repetitive centromeric sequences. Thus, CMT3 is a key determinant for non-CG methylation. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could account for the observation that in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. The 791 residue "chromomethylase" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA.	['Chromomethylases (CMTs), which constitute a plant-specific DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase family, are involved primarily in the maintenance of symmetrical CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and they also play a role in de novo methylation. CMTs are characterized by the presence of a chromatin-associated domain (chromodomain) inserted within the catalytic protein motifs I and IV. CMTs have likely evolved because of  the high levels of CpNpG methylation present in plant genomes relative to animal genomes. The targeting of CMT methylation is accomplished by short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways and histone methylation (H3K9, H3K27). It has been shown that transposons are in vivo targets of CMT-dependent methylation, suggesting that CMTs play a role in the plant genome surveillance. In Arabidopsis, CMTs play a key role in egg cell reprogramming and normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote by mediating transposon and euchromatin epigenetic gene silencing. In tomatoes, CMTs are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit development which suggests involvement of CMTs in the locus-specific control of methylation in the pericarp during fruit growth.']

515de643298dcd4e51000022	What is the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease?	The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients, including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Current evidence indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific, they do not act through the same mechanisms, and nor are all probiotics indicated for the same health conditions. However, they do share several common features in that they exert anti-inflammatory effects, they employ different strategies to antagonize competing microorganisms, and they induce cytoprotective changes in the host either through enhancement of barrier function, or through the upregulation of cytoprotective host proteins. Most surveyed physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the literature supports their usage for these conditions. This study suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium probiotics for these patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and radiation enteritis. These results provide some evidence that viable Bifidobacterium lactis strain Bb 12, added to an acidified infant formula, has some protective effect against acute diarrhea in healthy children. Probiotics are live, microbial food supplements that benefit the host animal by improving intestinal microbial balance. Their major role in preventing and treating gastrointestinal disease appears to be from their effect on the immune process, protection against abnormal invasive bacteria, and in the production of short-chain fatty acids from starch and non-starch polysaccharides.

55167dec46478f2f2c00000a	What is the common feature in congenital central hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson syndromes?	Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a fairly frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children. It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations On the other hand, about 30% of HSCR are syndromic. Hitherto, the disease causing gene has been identified for eight Mendelian syndromes with HSCR: congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS), Mowat-Wilson (MWS), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Shah-Waardenburg (WS4), cartilage-hair-hypoplasia (CHH), Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO), Goldberg-Sprintzsen (GSS), and hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS) The syndromic HSCR entities studied were congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS) and Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), caused by PHOX2B and ZFHX1B gene mutations, respectively The RET locus was genotyped in 143 CCHS patients, among whom 44 had HSCR, and in 30 MWS patients, among whom 20 had HSCR RET was shown to act as a modifier gene for the HSCR phenotype in patients with CCHS but not with MWS These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations Hitherto, the disease causing gene has been identified for eight Mendelian syndromes with HSCR: congenital central hypoventilation (CCHS), Mowat-Wilson (MWS), Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Shah-Waardenburg (WS4), cartilage-hair-hypoplasia (CHH), Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO), Goldberg-Sprintzsen (GSS), and hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of the aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS).

5c73ad0c7c78d69471000094	What is the mechanism of action of cariprazine?	OBJECTIVE: Cariprazine, a dopamine D3/D2 partial agonist atypical antipsychotic with preferential binding to D3 receptors, is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Two new partial dopamine agonists, brexpiprazole and cariprazine, are now available in addition to aripiprazole.  AIM: Cariprazine, a dopamine D3 -preferring D3 /D2 receptor partial agonist, is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. The contribution of dopamine D2 receptors to cariprazine's in vivo effects is prevalent and that of D3 receptors is less apparent. Expert opinion: Cariprazine shows highest affinity toward D3 receptors, followed by D2, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT1A receptors. It also shows moderate affinity toward σ1, 5-HT2A, and histamine H1 receptors. Conclusions In combination with previous studies, these results suggest that cariprazine has a unique pharmacological profile and distinct dopamine D3 receptor-dependent mechanism of action that may be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Cariprazine Exhibits Anxiolytic and Dopamine D3 Receptor-Dependent Antidepressant Effects in the Chronic Stress Model. Background Cariprazine, a D3-preferring dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist, is a new antipsychotic drug recently approved in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. This antianhedonic-like effect of cariprazine was not observed in D3-knockout mice, suggesting that the cariprazine antidepressant-like activity is mediated by dopamine D3 receptors. RATIONALE Cariprazine (RGH-188) is a D₃-preferring dopamine D₃/D₂ receptor partial agonist antipsychotic candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. Cariprazine is a recently developed antipsychotic drug with a partial agonism for the D2 and D3 receptors. AIM Cariprazine, a dopamine D3 -preferring D3 /D2 receptor partial agonist, is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. Cariprazine (RGH-188), a D₃-preferring dopamine D₃/D₂ receptor partial agonist antipsychotic candidate demonstrates anti-abuse potential in rats. This study used two rodent paradigms to investigate the action of the dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist cariprazine. Cariprazine also displays partial agonism at serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors in vitro. Cariprazine is also a partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors. Cariprazine is a dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, with a preference for the D3 receptor.

601c0b071cb411341a000009	What is the mode of action of dexamethasone?	Cell death induced by dexamethasone in lymphoid leukemia is mediated through initiation of autophagy. Glucocorticoids are fundamental drugs used in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies with apoptotic cell death as the hitherto proposed mechanism of action. We show that dexamethasone induced autophagy upstream of apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. mpact of corticosteroids and statins on INa and its tachycardia-induced alterations also contribute to the mode of action of these substances in upstream treatment of atrial fibrillation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) due to their immunosuppressive activity, but they also reduce the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect of the allogeneic T cells contained in the graft. Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid (GC), in feed has been shown to increase gut permeabilit Although glucocorticoids (GCs) are a mainstay in the clinical management of asthma, the target cells that mediate their therapeutic effects are unknown. Contrary to our expectation, we found that GC receptor (GR) expression in immune cells was dispensable for successful therapy of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) with dexamethasone. Instead, GC treatment was compromised in mice expressing a defective GR in the nonhematopoietic compartment or selectively lacking the GR in airway epithelial cells. Further, we found that an intact GR dimerization interface was a prerequisite for the suppression of AAI and airway hyperresponsiveness by GCs. Our observation that the ability of dexamethasone to modulate gene expression in airway epithelial cells coincided with its potency to resolve AAI supports a crucial role for transcriptional regulation by the GR in this cell type. In reporter assays, dexamethasone and Palovarotene induced transcriptional activity of their respective GRE or RARE constructs and did not interfere with each other's pathway.  In sum, corticosteroids and Palovarotene appear to block HO via common and distinct mechanisms. Most importantly, they directly or indirectly inhibit the recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells present at the affected site, thus alleviating the effects of key HO instigators. Proteomic and Metabolomic Analyses Reveal Contrasting Anti-Inflammatory Effects of an Extract of Mucor Racemosus Secondary Metabolites Compared to Dexamethasone.

The mode of action of dexamethasone was not specifically investigated in our study; however, it may suppress neutrophil function and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in its shared ability with BW755C to reduce the formation of leukotrienes. Glucocorticoids have been shown repeatedly to inhibit the release of prolactin (PRL) in the rat but their site and mode of action is unknown. Dexamethasone inhibits nitric oxide-mediated cytotoxicity via effects on both macrophages and target cells. o the pleiotropic mode of action exerted by glucocorticoids which include profound anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, direct inhibition on SMC proliferation and apoptosis, their potential in the prevention of restenosis has gained widespread interest. Over  fic mode of action of dexamethasone was not investigated; however, its anti-inflammatory effects were most likely responsible for the improvement of flap survival by suppressing the circulating neutrophil and decreasing reperfusion injury. Dexameth Glucocorticoids (GCs) influence a great variety of cellular functions by at least three important modes of action: the activation (or repression) of genes controlled by binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes and the recently discovered cross-talk to other transcription factors such as NF-kappaB.

We found this dimerization region to have sequence similarity to PDZ domains, which have been previously shown to be involved in signaling by conferring protein-protein interactions.

5172f8118ed59a060a000019	Which metazaon species or taxa are known to lack selenoproteins	Relaxation of selective constraints causes independent selenoprotein extinction in insect genomes. Selenoproteins are a diverse family of proteins notable for the presence of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine. Until very recently, all metazoan genomes investigated encoded selenoproteins, and these proteins had therefore been believed to be essential for animal life. Challenging this assumption, recent comparative analyses of insect genomes have revealed that some insect genomes appear to have lost selenoprotein genes.  In this paper we investigate in detail the fate of selenoproteins, and that of selenoprotein factors, in all available arthropod genomes. We use a variety of in silico comparative genomics approaches to look for known selenoprotein genes and factors involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis. We have found that five insect species have completely lost the ability to encode selenoproteins and that selenoprotein loss in these species, although so far confined to the Endopterygota infraclass, cannot be attributed to a single evolutionary event, but rather to multiple, independent events. Loss of selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors is usually coupled to the deletion of the entire no-longer functional genomic region, rather than to sequence degradation and consequent pseudogenisation. Such dynamics of gene extinction are consistent with the high rate of genome rearrangements observed in Drosophila. Selenoproteins have been independently lost in several insect species, possibly as a consequence of the relaxation in insects of the selective constraints acting across metazoans to maintain selenoproteins. The dispensability of selenoproteins in insects may be related to the fundamental differences in antioxidant defense between these animals and other metazoans.	['Some insect genomes have lost the capacity of synthesizing selenoproteins. Several insect species without selenoproteins have been identified.']

Renal failure-associated calciphylaxis, also termed calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), is a life-threatening condition usually observed in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis or after renal transplantation Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA, calciphylaxis) is a rare disease predominantly in dialysis patients and associated with high mortality. Painful skin ulcerations and calcification of cutaneous arterioles characterize calciphylaxis <b>WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE</b>: Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially life-threatening cause of skin necrosis and is poorly recognized by clinicians in non-uraemic patients.<br><b>CASE DESCRIPTION</b>: We report five cases of warfarin-induced calciphylaxis in patients with normal renal function. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a well-described entity in end-stage kidney disease and renal transplant patients; however, little systematic information is available on calciphylaxis from nonuremic causes. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially life-threatening cause of skin necrosis and is poorly recognized by clinicians in non-uraemic patients. OBJECTIVE Calciphylaxis, a rare disorder typically affecting renal failure patients, results in vascular calcification with subsequent skin necrosis, gangrene, and often death from sepsis. Calciphylaxis is a metastatic calcification-induced vasculopathy that results in the occlusion of small blood vessels. Calciphylaxis is a small vessel vasculopathy, characterized by medial wall calcification that develops in a few patients with chronic renal failure. BACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Calciphylaxis is characterized by painful, violaceous, mottled skin lesions (livedo reticularis) that may progress to tissue necrosis, nonhealing ulcers, gangrene, and potentially amputation, sepsis, or death. Calciphylaxis is a relatively rare disease, observed mainly in patients on dialysis, associated with high mortality rates, and characterized by painful skin ulceration. Calciphylaxis is a rare condition of induced systemic hypersensitivity in which tissues respond to appropriate challenging agents with a sudden local calcification. It is characterized by acute calcium deposition in the medial layer of small and intermediate dermal vasculature that can lead to epidermal ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis Calciphylaxis is a rare condition characterized by medial calcification of small- and medium-sized vessels that subsequently leads to ischemic necrosis. Calciphylaxis is a disease in which metastatic calcification affects small- and medium-sized vessels resulting in significant dermatologic manifestations. Calciphylaxis is a severe complication of chronic renal failure, confined almost exclusively to patients on dialysis therapy. Histological characteristics of calciphylaxis include small-vessel calcifications of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral organs. These vascular changes promote tissue ischemia that often results in tissue necrosis Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy, also named calciphylaxis, is a rare but serious disorder characterized by medial mural calcification of small vessel leading to tissue ischaemia.  Calciphylaxis is a rare complication that occurs in 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) each year. Extensive microvascular calcification and occlusion/thrombosis lead to violaceous skin lesions, which progress to nonhealing ulcers with secondary infection, often leading to sepsis and death.  Calciphylaxis is a rare, usually fatal vasculopathic disorder characterized by cutaneous ischemia and necrosis due to calcification of arterioles Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially fatal complication of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with abnormal calcium metabolism.  Calciphylaxis causes calcification, thrombosis, cutaneous ischemia, and necrosis in the skin and subcutaneous tissue Calciphylaxis is a rare phenomenon of medium- and small-vessel calcifications leading to cutaneous necrosis mimicking vasculitis.  Calciphylaxis combines features of vascular thrombotic occlusion and endoluminal calcification. I Calciphylaxis refers to a syndrome of calcium deposition in the small and intermediate dermal vasculature which can lead to epidermal ischaemia, ulceration and necrosis.

56b469448525abca1e000007	What is the main characteristic of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?	Motor neuron diseases (MND), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that share the common characteristic of upper and/or lower motor neuron degeneration. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. There are four main hypotheses about the cause of ALS: excitotoxicity linked to glutamate receptor overactivation; mutation of the superoxide dismutase gene; production of autoantibodies to calcium channels; neurofilament accumulation. The motoneuron degeneration characteristic of ALS could be caused by any one or a combination of these mechanisms. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease and evidence from mice expressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing SOD1 mutations suggest that neurodegeneration is a non-cell autonomous process where microglial cells influence disease progression	['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons.

RESULTS: 4049 RA patients who received CZP were included in the safety pooling; total exposure 9277 PY, mean exposure 2.1 years (range 0.04-7.6). SIE, most frequently pneumonia (IR 0.73/100 PY), were the most common serious AE, occurring more frequently in CZP compared to placebo-treated patients in RCT (IR 5.61/100 PY vs 1.35/100 PY, odds ratio (OR) 4.35, 95% CI 0.65 to 29.30). SIE rates were lower in the CZP-treated population including OLE (ER 4.33/100 PY). 44 patients developed tuberculosis (IR 0.47/100 PY), 39 from high endemic regions. 58 deaths occurred in CZP-exposed patients (IR 0.63/100 PY) and 70 developed malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (IR 0.76/100 PY), including five lymphomas (IR 0.05/100 PY). As well as displaying clinical efficacy, there is evidence to suggest that CZP has unique characteristics, including reduced transfer across the placenta and reduced frequency of injection site reactions. Furthermore, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CZP have demonstrated rapid improvements in workplace and home productivity in patients contributing to reducing the significant socioeconomic burden of RA. To assess the effectiveness and safety of certolizumab pegol (CDP870) in patients with RA who have not responded well to conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs  With an overall high grade of evidence this review revealed an improvement of clinical results (ACR50, 28 joint disease activity score (DAS-28) remission and HAQ scores) with certolizumab pegol. Adverse events were more frequent with certolizumab; there was a statistically significant increase in the number of serious adverse events, infections and hypertension. The clinical evidence was derived from two multicentre blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CZP + MTX to placebo + MTX (the RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 trials). RAPID 1 lasted 52 weeks with 982 patients and RAPID 2 24 weeks with 619 patients. Evidence for clinical effectiveness of CZP in mono-therapy came from the 24-week FAST4WARD trial with 220 patients that compared CZP (400 mg every 4 weeks) versus placebo. The three key RCTs demonstrated statistically significant superiority of CZP + MTX versus placebo + MTX and of CZP versus placebo with respect to a variety of outcomes including ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 measures and quality of life measures at 3 and 6 months. On the basis of results from the indirect comparison meta-analyses, the manufacturer suggested that CZP may be at least as effective as other 'biological' DMARD (bDMARD) comparators and, in a few ACR measures at 3 and 6 months, more effective. CZP is an effective therapy for adult RA patients whose disease has failed to respond adequately to cDMARDs including MTX or who are intolerant of MTX. The cost-effectiveness of CZP relative to other bDMARDs is unclear because the economic modelling undertaken may have ignored relevant effectiveness data and potential differences between trial populations, and so may have included effectiveness results that were biased in favour of CZP	['Improvement of clinical results (ACR50, 28 joint disease activity score (DAS-28) remission and HAQ scores) with certolizumab pegol.

Among 1155 differentially expressed circRNAs, 715 were upregulated and 440 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that hsa_circ_103110, hsa_circ_104689 and hsa_circ_104821 levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, whereas hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were downregulated.

This study provides evidence that circRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are important in carcinogenesis because they participate in cancer-related pathways and sequester miRNAs. Circular RNAs and their associations with breast cancer subtypes. Notably, circRNA results reveal that normal-adjacent tissues in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) subtype have relatively higher numbers of circRNAs than tumor samples in TCGA. Similar phenomenon of high circRNA numbers were observed in normal breast-mammary tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Finally, we observed that number of circRNAs in normal-adjacent samples of ER+ subtype is inversely correlated to the risk-of-relapse proliferation (ROR-P) score for proliferating genes, suggesting that circRNA frequency may be a marker for cell proliferation in breast cancer. We believe that Circ-Seq will be a valuable tool to identify circRNAs useful in the diagnosis and treatment of other cancers and complex diseases.

56a3a8c7496b62f23f000009	Elaborate on the association between Genomic Regulatory Blocks (GRBs) and target genes	Recent functional studies have demonstrated that many microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed by RNA polymerase II in a specific spatiotemporal manner during the development of organisms and play a key role in cell-lineage decisions and morphogenesis. They are therefore functionally related to a number of key protein coding developmental genes, that form genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) with arrays of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) functioning as long-range enhancers that collaboratively regulate the expression of their target genes Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene. We show evidence that GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters. Target gene expression correlates with the acetylation state of HCNEs in the region GRB targets are genes with a number of unique features that are the likely cause of their ability to respond to regulatory inputs from very long distances. Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution. We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated "bystander" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. BACKGROUND: Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation.  GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene. The tight regulation of target genes, complex arrangement of regulatory inputs, and the differential responsiveness of genes in the region call for the examination of fundamental rules governing transcriptional activity in GRBs.  Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation.

The treatment of choice for localized primary GI lymphoma is controversial. Complete surgical resection may increase the chance of complete remission, but mortality and relapse rates might be higher than those observed with combination chemotherapy alone. The most common gastric lymphoma are low-grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL) of MALT type. In early stages of disease, H. pylori eradication alone may lead to complete lymphoma remission in up to 75% of cases. Nonresponder or locally advanced lymphoma should be treated with radiation therapy. Advanced lymphoma may be treated with the nucleoside analogon cladribine within clinical trials In patients with primary gastric diffuse large cell lymphoma and aggressive histology, diffuse large cell lymphoma in early stage SCT achieved good results, but surgery was associated with some cases of lethal complications. Thus it appears that CT should be considered the treatment of choice in this patient setting. Controversy remains regarding the best treatment for primary gastric lymphoma (PGL). Recent developments in diagnosis and chemotherapy have changed strategies for this disease. With the exception of eradication therapy in H. pylori-positive low-grade lymphoma of stage EI and the subgroup of locally advanced high-grade lymphoma, resection remains the treatment of choice.  The treatment of primary gastric lymphoma is controversial. The role of surgery has come to be questioned with increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of gastric lymphoma and with new therapeutic approaches such as eradication of Helicobacter pylori. curative resection is the treatment of choice for gastric lymphoma, but radiation therapy may offer some benefit when complete resection is not feasible.

We now demonstrate that αIISp is also important for telomere maintenance after ICL damage. It localizes to telomeres in S phase after ICL damage where it has enhanced association with TRF1 and TRF2 and is required for recruitment of the ICL repair protein, XPF, to damage-induced foci at telomeres. In telomerase-positive normal cells depleted of αIISp by siRNA or in Fanconi anemia, complementation group A (FA-A) cells, where αIISp levels are 35-40% of normal, ICL damage results in failure of XPF to localize to telomeres, markedly increased telomere dysfunction-induced foci, followed by catastrophic loss of telomeres Restoration of αIISp levels to normal in FA-A cells corrects these deficiencies previous works suggested an accelerated shortening of telomeres in FA A higher frequency of extra-chromosomic TTAGGG signals and of chromosome ends with undetectable TTAGGG repeats was observed in FA cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), suggesting intensive breakage at telomeric sequences. This was proven by measuring the frequency of excess of telomeric signals per cell, which was 2.8-fold higher in FA Consistent with previous reports, quantitative FISH analysis showed an accelerated telomere shortening of 0.68 kb in FA, which occurred concurrently in both chromosome arms in a similar magnitude Our data therefore suggest that the telomere erosion in FA is caused by a higher rate of breakage at TTAGGG sequences in vivo in differentiated cells, in addition to mere replicative shortening during lymphocyte proliferation Consistent with impaired telomeres in FA patients, we observed a >10-fold increase in chromosome end fusions in FA compared to normal controls Since previous works suggested an accelerated shortening of telomeres in FA, we have studied several markers of telomere integrity and function in FA patients and age-matched controls to get insights into the mechanisms and consequences of telomere erosion in FA.

Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity.RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

somaticsniper strelka and mutect2 were carefully evaluated on the real whole exome sequencing wes depth of 50x and ultra deep targeted sequencing udt seq depth of 370x data the four tools returned poor consensus on candidates only 20 of calls were with multiple hits by the callers for both wes and udt seq mutect2 and strelka obtained the largest proportion of cosmic entries as well as the lowest rate of dbsnp presence and high alternative alleles in control calls demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency calling snv on udt seq data which were of much higher read depth discovered additional true positive variations despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state of the art snv calling methods but also shed light on the access to more accurate snv identification in the future. high throughput next generation sequencing is a powerful tool to identify the genotypic landscapes of somatic variants and therapeutic targets in various cancers including gastric cancer forming the basis for personalized medicine in the clinical setting although the advent of many computational algorithms leads to higher accuracy in somatic variant calling no standard method exists due to the limitations of each method here we constructed a new pipeline we combined two different somatic variant callers with different algorithms strelka and varscan 2 and evaluated performance using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 19 japanese cases with gastric cancer gc then we characterized these tumors based on identified driver molecular alterations more single nucleotide variants snvs and small insertions deletions were detected by strelka and varscan 2 respectively snvs detected by both tools showed higher accuracy for estimating somatic variants compared with those detected by only one of the two tools and accurately showed the mutation signature and mutations of driver genes reported for gc our combinatorial pipeline may have an advantage in detection of somatic mutations in gc and may be useful for further genomic characterization of japanese patients with gc to improve the efficacy of gc treatments j med invest 64 233 240 august 2017. with the advent of relatively affordable high throughput technologies dna sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer research projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and treatment somatic cancer only single nucleotide variants snvs are the simplest class of mutation yet their identification in dna sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic snv sites in matched cancer normal sequencing datasets are varscan somaticsniper jointsnvmix and strelka in this analysis we apply these four snv calling algorithms to cancer normal illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia cml patient the candidate snv sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each snv calling algorithm comparing the candidate snv sets returned by varscan somaticsniper jointsnvmix2 and strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites their susceptibility to various sources of noise and their sensitivities to low allelic fraction candidates data accession number sra081939 code at http

mutations in cancer in research settings and increasingly in clinical settings for molecular diagnostics guiding therapy decisions somatic variant callers perform paired comparisons of sequencing data from cancer tissue and matched normal tissue in order to detect somatic mutations the advent of many new somatic variant callers creates a need for comparison and validation of the tools as no de facto standard for detection of somatic mutations exists and only limited comparisons have been reported we have performed a comprehensive evaluation using exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing data of paired tumor normal samples from five breast cancer patients to evaluate the performance of nine publicly available somatic variant callers ebcall mutect seurat shimmer indelocator somatic sniper strelka varscan 2 and virmid for the detection of single nucleotide mutations and small deletions and insertions we report a large variation in the number of calls from the nine somatic variant callers on the same sequencing data and highly variable agreement sequencing depth had markedly diverse impact on individual callers as for some callers increased sequencing depth highly improved sensitivity for snv calling we report ebcall mutect virmid and strelka to be the most reliable somatic variant callers for both exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing for indel calling ebcall is superior due to high sensitivity and robustness to changes in sequencing depths. high throughput sequencing is rapidly becoming common practice in clinical diagnosis and cancer research many algorithms have been developed for somatic single nucleotide variant snv detection in matched tumor normal dna sequencing although numerous studies have compared the performance of various algorithms on exome data there has not yet been a systematic evaluation using pcr enriched amplicon data with a range of variant allele fractions the recently developed gold standard variant set for the reference individual na12878 by the nist led genome in a bottle consortium nist giab provides a good resource to evaluate admixtures with various snv fractions using the nist giab gold standard we compared the performance of five popular somatic snv calling algorithms gatk unifiedgenotyper followed by simple subtraction mutect strelka somaticsniper and varscan2 for matched tumor normal amplicon and exome sequencing data we demonstrated that the five commonly used somatic snv calling methods are applicable to both targeted amplicon and exome sequencing data however the sensitivities of these methods vary based on the allelic fraction of the mutation in the tumor sample our analysis can assist researchers in choosing a somatic snv calling method suitable for their specific needs. identifying genomic variants is a fundamental first step toward the understanding of the role of inherited and acquired variation in disease the accelerating growth in the corpus of sequencing data that underpins such analysis is making the data download bottleneck more evident placing substantial burdens on the research community to keep pace as a result the search for alternative approaches to the traditional download and analyze paradigm on local computing resources has led to a rapidly growing demand for cloud computing solutions for genomics analysis here we introduce the genome variant investigation platform genomevip an open source framework for performing genomics variant discovery and annotation using cloud or local high performance computing infrastructure genomevip orchestrates the analysis of whole genome and exome sequence data using a set of robust and popular task specific tools including varscan gatk pindel breakdancer strelka and genome strip through a web interface genomevip has been used for genomic analysis in large data projects such as the tcga pancanatlas and in other projects such as the icgc pilots cptac icgc tcga dream challenges and the 1000 genomes sv project here we demonstrate genomevip s ability to provide high confidence annotated somatic germline and de novo variants of potential biological significance using publicly available data sets. precision medicine attempts to individualize cancer therapy by matching tumor specific genetic changes with effective targeted therapies a crucial first step in this process is the reliable identification of cancer relevant variants which is considerably complicated by the impurity and heterogeneity of clinical tumor samples we compared the impact of admixture of non cancerous cells and low somatic allele frequencies on the sensitivity and precision of 19 state of the art snv callers we studied both whole exome and targeted gene panel data and up to 13 distinct parameter configurations for each tool we found vast differences among callers based on our comprehensive analyses we recommend joint tumor normal calling with mutect ebcall or strelka for whole exome somatic variant calling and haplotypecaller or freebayes for whole exome germline calling for targeted gene panel data on a single tumor sample lofreqstar performed best we further found that tumor impurity and admixture had a negative impact on precision and in particular sensitivity in whole exome experiments at admixture levels of 60 to 90 sometimes seen in pathological biopsies sensitivity dropped significantly even when variants were originally present in the tumor at 100 allele frequency sensitivity to low frequency snvs improved with targeted panel data but whole exome data allowed more efficient identification of germline variants effective somatic variant calling requires high quality pathological samples with minimal admixture a consciously selected sequencing strategy and the appropriate variant calling tool with settings optimized for the chosen type of data. we performed whole exome sequencing of pretreatment biopsies and examined whether genome wide metrics of overall

mutations in either gene set had 6 pcr rate 1 15 with lapatinib but had the highest pcr rate 52 8 15 with trastuzumab alone mutations in the rhoa pathway are associated with pcr to lapatinib and

The selling and importing of puffer fish species and their products was banned in Thailand in 2002, because of possible neurotoxic effects. Efficiency of a rapid test for detection of tetrodotoxin in puffer fish. Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters, especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Food poisoning due to ingestion of a puffer fish occurred in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, in October 2008, causing neurotoxic symptoms similar to those of tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning.  Our findings raised a concern for people, not only Thais but also inhabitants of other countries situated on the Andaman coast; consuming puffers of the Andaman seas is risky due to potential TTX intoxication. Toxic marine puffer fish in Thailand seas and tetrodotoxin they contained. Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative, non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to produce tetrodotoxin (TTX) Isolation and identification of a new tetrodotoxin-producing bacterial species, Raoultella terrigena, from Hong Kong marine puffer fish Takifugu niphobles. Green toadfish Lagocephalus lunaris inhabits tropical and subtropical seas and contains high tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in the muscle as well as liver and gonad Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly potent neurotoxin that blocks the action potential by selectively binding to voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)) Suspected tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning was associated with eating unknown fish in April 2009 in Taiwan Marine pufferfish generally contain a large amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in their skin and viscera, and have caused many incidences of food poisoning, especially in Japan.  TTX is originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria.  , TTX poisoning due to marine snails has recently spread through Japan, China, Taiwan, and Europe.

589c389278275d0c4a00003e	What is the "wearing-off" phenomenon in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's Disease?	It is unlike the "wearing-off" phenomenon that occurs when dopaminergic drug levels decline and responds to dopaminergic rescue drugs.  Unfortunately, chronic use of traditional levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor formulations is associated with the development of complications, such as wearing-off and dyskinesia. One of the first complications observed with levodopa therapy is wearing-off, which can emerge within 1-3 years of initiation of levodopa treatment. Wearing-off is characterized by the predictable emergence of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms before the next scheduled dose of medication. Despite effective treatment options to tackle wearing-off, it remains underrecognized and under treated.  Shortness of breath, a 'wearing-off' symptom in Parkinson's disease. Although levodopa is considered the gold standard for Parkinson's disease therapy, prolonged use of this drug can result in motor complications such as a 'wearing-off' phenomenon. This outcome is seen in a significant number of patients with Parkinson's disease taking levodopa and, in some cases, is observed only a few hours after intake of the last dose of levodopa. Patients experiencing the wearing-off period may present with sensory, autonomic, psychiatric and motor fluctuations. Although infrequent, shortness of breath is an important non-motor wearing-off symptom experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease. We report here on a patient with Parkinson's disease who was taking levodopa and developed both shortness of breath and hyperventilation during wearing-off periods. His shortness of breath was determined to be a wearing-off phenomenon and his condition improved with the addition of a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor (entacapone). The wearing-off phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complication of prolonged levodopa usage. During this phenomenon, motor symptoms such as rigidity and freezing re-emerge. This is often accompanied by non-motor symptoms, including anxiety, the so-called wearing-off related anxiety (WRA).  Patients with wearing-off tended to receive higher L-dopa dosage and endure longer duration of L-dopa treatment.  The wearing-off phenomenon frequently complicates levodopa therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of tolcapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, on the bioavailability and efficacy of levodopa were evaluated in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 8 of whom showed signs of daily motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon). Although infrequent, shortness of breath is an important non-motor wearing-off symptom experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease. Although levodopa is considered the gold standard for Parkinson's disease therapy, prolonged use of this drug can result in motor complications such as a 'wearing-off' phenomenon. More than 50% of patients with Parkinsons disease develop motor response fluctuations (the wearing off" phenomenon) after more than five years of levodopa therapy More than 50% of patients with Parkinsons disease develop motor response fluctuations (the "wearing off" phenomenon) after more than five years of levodopa therapy The wearing-off phenomenon in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) is a complication of prolonged levodopa usage Short-term effect of a single levodopa dose on micturition disturbance in Parkinsons disease patients with the wearing-off phenomenon To evaluate the effectiveness of entacapone in the management of levodopa wearing-off in Parkinsons disease (PD) in a naturalistic, real-life setting.This prospective, open-label, observational study included patients with idiopathic PD. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had been taking 3-5 doses of levodopa per day for ≥2 months and had shown signs of levodopa wearing-off for ≥1 month The duration of clinical control of motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) treated with levodopa/carbidopa preparations eventually starts to shorten, a phenomenon known as end-of-dose "wearing off." The involvement of core nonmotor symptoms of "wearing off" (depressed mood, pain/aching, anxiety, and cloudy/slowed thinking) is not well understood. Efficacy and tolerability of entacapone in patients with Parkinsons disease treated with levodopa plus a dopamine agonist and experiencing wearing-off motor fluctuations The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month study of 162 patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) treated with levodopa and a dopamine agonist and experiencing wearing-off motor fluctuations Efficacy and safety of entacapone in levodopa/carbidopa versus levodopa/benserazide treated Parkinsons disease patients with wearing-off We conclude that tolcapone as an adjunct offers promise for the relief of the "wearing-off " phenomenon in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. We conclude that tolcapone as an adjunct offers promise for the relief of the "wearing-off" phenomenon in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. Our data also support the involvement of postsynaptic dopamine receptor mechanisms in the wearing-off phenomenon seen in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. Short-term effect of a single levodopa dose on micturition disturbance in Parkinson's disease patients with the wearing-off phenomenon. It is unlike the "wearing-off" phenomenon that occurs when dopaminergic drug levels decline and responds to dopaminergic rescue drugs.  More than 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease develop motor response fluctuations (the 'wearing off" phenomenon) after more than five years of levodopa therapy. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of tolcapone on levodopa dosage in parkinsonian patients whose "wearing-off" phenomenon has been controlled with more frequent levodopa dosage. More than 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease develop motor response fluctuations (the "wearing off" phenomenon) after more than five years of levodopa therapy. To evaluate the role of the practicing pharmacist in the identification and current treatment of the levodopa wearing-off phenomenon experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who are receiving chronic levodopa therapy.Literature retrieval was accessed through MEDLINE (1967-June 2007) using the terms levodopa, wearing-off, and Parkinson's disease. This study investigated the effects of OPC in comparison with placebo on levodopa pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety, COMT activity and motor response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuations.This was a randomized, multicentre, double-blind and placebo-controlled study in four parallel groups of PD patients treated with standard-release 100/25 mg levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide and with motor fluctuations (wearing-OFF phenomenon). Patients experiencing the wearing-off period may present with sensory, autonomic, psychiatric and motor fluctuations. Although infrequent, shortness of breath is an important non-motor wearing-off symptom experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease. This outcome is seen in a significant number of patients with Parkinson's disease taking levodopa and, in some cases, is observed only a few hours after intake of the last dose of levodopa.

It is suggested that tolcapone may be useful drug adjunct to levodopa in treating patients with PD with wearing-off phenomena.. Levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease is often complicated by the occurrence of motor fluctuations, which can be predictable ('wearing-off') or unpredictable ('on-off'). She was treated with 400 mg/day of levodopa-carbidopa, which improved her symptoms, however, she developed wearing off phenomenon 3 years after the initiation of levodopa treatment. [Benefit of L-DOPA-without-DCI (decarboxylase inhibitor) therapy on wearing-off phenomenon in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease patients]. To evaluate the role of the practicing pharmacist in the identification and current treatment of the levodopa wearing-off phenomenon experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who are receiving chronic levodopa therapy. However, once the decision to initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and the 'wearing off' phenomenon.. These results suggest that wearing-off phenomenon may arise as a consequence of the degeneration of dopamine terminals due to natural disease progression with a resultant inability to buffer variations in levodopa availability; on-off phenomenon, may reflect additional postsynaptic dopamine receptor dysregulation, possibly in response to the resultant, nonphysiologic fluctuations in synaptic dopamine.. Conversion from oral to intravenous levodopa treatment immediately stabilized plasma levodopa levels in both the wearing-off and on-off groups; motor variability also decreased, especially in those with wearing-off phenomenon.	["Chronic administration of traditional levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor formulations to Paskinson's Disease patients is associated with the development of complications, such as wearing-off phenomenon. Wearing-off phenomenon is characterized by the predictable emergence of motor symptoms (e.g. rigidity and freezing) and nonmotor PD symptoms (e.g. anxiety and shortness of breath), before the next scheduled dose of medication."]

5c58db1386df2b9174000014	What are the CADD scores?	CADD: predicting the deleteriousness of variants throughout the human genome. Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a widely used measure of variant deleteriousness that can effectively prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses, particularly highly penetrant contributors to severe Mendelian disorders. CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection.

52ed27c098d0239505000030	What is the role of thyroid hormone in Stem cell differentiation?	During T3-dependent amphibian metamorphosis, the digestive tract is extensively remodeled from the larval to the adult form for the adaptation of the amphibian from its aquatic herbivorous lifestyle to that of a terrestrial carnivorous frog. This involves de novo formation of ASCs that requires T3 signaling in both the larval epithelium and nonepithelial tissues. Our results revealed that T3 induces distinct tissue-specific gene regulation programs associated with the remodeling of the intestine, particularly the formation of the ASCs, and further suggested the existence of potentially many novel stem cell-associated genes, at least in the intestine during development. BMP signaling is an important modulator of the late differentiation stages in MSC chondrogenesis and the thyroid hormone induces this pathway.  In addition, thyroid hormone treatment of hiPS-CMs attenuated the fetal gene expression in favor of a more adult-like pattern.  Exposure of embryos at this developmental stage for 24 h to either a TH antagonist, NH-3, or to tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant and known TH disruptor, differentially modulated the expression of a number of TH target genes implicated in neural stem cell function or neural differentiation.  In the intestinal epithelium and the retina, TRα1 and TRβ2 are expressed at the level of the precursors where they induce cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.  Thyroid hormone signaling acts as a neurogenic switch by repressing Sox2 in the adult neural stem cell niche. We will discuss observations suggesting that liganded T3 receptor (TR) regulates cell autonomous formation of adult intestinal progenitor cells and that T3 action in the connective tissue is important for the establishment of the stem cell niche. In general, in vitro stem cell differentiation techniques stimulate a wide range of developmental programs, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR) pathways. Although no difference of in vitro proliferation of NSCs was observed in the presence of epidermal growth factor, maturation of oligodendrocytes (defined by process number and length) was enhanced in hyperthyroidism, suggesting a more mature state than in control animals.  Terminal erythroid maturation was significantly improved by adding human serum and thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine [T3]) to the differentiation medium. This resulted in highly synchronous differentiation of the cells toward enucleated erythrocytes within 6 days T(3) alone stimulated neural differentiation in a similar fashion as that seen with RA in both wtES and mES cells.

56c1f027ef6e394741000049	Describe Mozart effect.	OBJECTIVE: Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect. According to the first publication in 1993 by Rauscher et al. [Nature 1993;365:611], the Mozart effect implies the enhancement of reasoning skills solving spatial problems in normal subjects after listening to Mozart's piano sonata K 448.  The Mozart Effect is a phenomenon whereby certain pieces of music induce temporary enhancement in "spatial temporal reasoning."  OBJECTIVE: Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart effect. Here, we investigated the cerebellar role in the association between spatial and musical domains, by testing performances in embodied (EMR) or abstract (AMR) mental rotation tasks of subjects listening Mozart Sonata K.448, which is reported to improve spatial-temporal reasoning, in the presence or in the absence of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left cerebellar hemisphere. In the absence of cerebellar cTBS, music listening did not influence either MR task, thus not revealing a "Mozart Effect".  Mozart K.448 has been shown to improve cognitive function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect.  Mozart's Sonata for two pianos in D major, K.448 (Mozart K.448), has been shown to improve mental function, leading to what is known as the Mozart effect. Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K.448 (Mozart K.448), has been shown to improve mental function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect.  Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K.448 (Mozart K.448), has been shown to improve mental function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect. Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart effect. The "Mozart effect" refers to claims that people perform better on tests of spatial abilities after listening to music composed by Mozart. Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect. The Mozart effect is an increase in spatial reasoning scores detected immediately after listening to the first movement of a Mozart piano sonata. The "Mozart effect" is the tendency to score higher on spatiotemporal IQ subscales following exposure to complex music such as Mozart's Sonata K.448. Mozart K.448 has been shown to improve cognitive function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect.  Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect. However, most of these reports only describe the phenomena but lack the scientific evidence needed to properly investigate the mechanism of Mozart Effect.  The Mozart effect is an increase in spatial reasoning scores detected immediately after listening to the first movement of a Mozart piano sonata. Rauscher and Shaw (1998) suggested that failure to produce a Mozart effect could arise from carryover effects of a spatial reasoning pretest which may interfere with the effect of listening to Mozart. Mozart K.448 has been shown to improve cognitive function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect.

58f4b3ee70f9fc6f0f000013	What is the function of the exosome?	Exosomes-secreted microRNAs play an important role in metastatic spread Exosome-mediated communication Cells are able to produce and release different types of vesicles, such as microvesicles and exosomes, in the extracellular microenvironment. According to the scientific community, both microvesicles and exosomes are able to take on and transfer different macromolecules from and to other cells, and in this way, they can influence the recipient cell function  Exosomes are 40-100-nm vesicles released by most cell types after fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane. Exosomes, ubiquitary in body fluids including urines, contain proteins and RNA species specific of the tissue of origin.  Exosomes, small membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment, are emerging as another important intercellular messenger in immune responses.  the exosome is a complex of 3' -->5' exoribonucleases that plays a key role in the processing and degradation of a wide variety of RNA substrates RNA exosome is responsible for a wide variety of RNA processing and degradation reactions ability of exosomes to carry and selectively deliver bioactive molecules (e.g., lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) confers on them the capacity to modulate the activity of receptor cells, even if these cells are located in distant tissues or organs.  Our data show that NKG2D is a likely physiological target for exosome-mediated immune evasion in cancer. Exosomes, a key component of cell paracrine secretion, can exert protective effects in various disease models Exosome secretion participates in the eradication of obsolete proteins but several findings, essentially in the immune system, indicate that exosomes constitute a potential mode of intercellular communication Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles, are believed to play important roles in intercellular communications. This study demonstrates that exosomes released from human macrophages negatively regulate endothelial cell migration through control of integrin trafficking.  We found that the majority of extracellular vesicles in the AH were in the exosome size range, suggesting that miRNAs housed within exosomes may function in communication between AH inflow and outflow tissues. umor cell-derived exosomes (TEX) suppress functions of immune cells.

518cb513310faafe08000007	What is the treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis?	Prednisone remains the preferred treatment modality of AIT type 2, because perchlorate given alone or in combination with prednisone had no better outcomes. Total thyroidectomy, by rapidly restoring euthyroidism, may improve cardiac function and reduce the risk of mortality in AIT patients with severe LV dysfunction. Prednisone restores euthyroidism in most type 2 AIT patients, irrespective of amiodarone continuation or withdrawal. However, continuing amiodarone increases the recurrence rate of thyrotoxicosis, causing a delay in the stable restoration of euthyroidism and a longer exposure of the heart to thyroid hormone excess. Steroid therapy should be started when findings indicate type II or mixed-type AIT. Beta blockers may prevent heart thyrotoxicosis and recurrence of primary arrhythmia if amiodarone is discontinued. Glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment in type 2 AIT, whereas thionamides play no role in this destructive thyroiditis. iopanoic can be used to rapidly lower FT(3) levels and to treat symptoms of thyrotoxicosis in a preoperative setting. The patient responded to iopanoic acid with a rapid decrease in his FT(3) level and slight increase in his FT(4) level. In patients with type-2 AIT, RAI treatment may be the therapy of choice for thyroid gland ablation. In type 1 AIT thionamides represent the treatment of choice for North Americans as well as for Europeans, Glucocorticoids are the selected treatment for type 2 AIT, alone (62%vs. 46% in Europe, P < 0.05) or in association with thionamides After restoration of euthyroidism, thyroid ablation in the absence of recurrent thyrotoxicosis is recommended in type 1 AIT less frequently by North Americans.

5fe31310a43ad31278000041	What is the role of TNF in obesity?	Macrophage TNF-alpha contributes to insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obesity. these data indicate that macrophage-derived TNF-alpha contributes to the pattern and extent of fat accumulation and insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity; however, this contribution is negligible in the presence of host-derived TNF-alpha. Expression of TNF-alpha protein in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue in obesity. TNF-alpha expression in omental adipose tissue could play a key role in contributing to cardiovascular risk in central obesity subjects. Influence of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on obesity and glucose metabolism. Transmembrane TNF-alpha enhances adipose tissue formation without altering insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in mice with nutritionally induced obesity. Unaltered TNF-alpha production by macrophages and monocytes in diet-induced obesity in the rat. Obesity and diabetes in TNF-alpha receptor- deficient mice. TNF, acting via its receptors, is a major contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance.  Importance of TNF-alpha and leptin in obesity and insulin resistance: a hypothesis on the impact of physical exercise. Elevated TNF-alpha expression induces insulin resistance by downregulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and decreasing the expression of GLUT-4 glucose transporters.  In a more recently established hypothesis of body weight control and regulation of metabolism, the adipocyte secretes leptin and locally expresses TNF-alpha, the latter being responsible for the expression of metabolic cardiovascular risk factors. TNF-a mRNA expression and TNF-alpha protein are greatly increased in adipose tissue from obese animals and humans Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and soluble TNF-alpha receptors in obesity. To study whether weight reducing treatment modulates serum concentration of TNF-alpha and two soluble TNF-alpha receptors in obese subjects. The observed decrease of the serum concentration of TNF-alpha and the increase in both TNF soluble receptors after weight reducing treatment in obese subjects, may be a counter-regulation preventing further weight loss. The role of TNFalpha and TNF receptors in obesity and insulin resistance. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction in human obesity: role of TNF-α. Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1-mediated TNF-alpha signaling protected Wistar rats from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. TNF-alpha plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance in which the effect of TNF-alpha signaling via TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1) largely remains controversial. Functional analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors in TNF-alpha-mediated insulin resistance in genetic obesity. ON: These data indicate that plasma concentrations of both soluble TNF receptors are elevated in obesity and insulin resistance, possibly as a function of excess body fat. The rep has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. To inv The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a central role in low-grade adipose tissue inflammation and development of insulin resistance during obesity. In  BACKGROUND: In obesity, increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha level is involved in the development of insulin re Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in the state of insulin resistance associated with obesity. It OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is thought to mediate, in part, the link between obesity and insulin resistance, and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have raised serum TNF-alpha concentratio Recent studies have shown that the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system is implicated in the insulin resistance of human obesity. Pla Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is one of the candidate mediators of insulin resistance associated with obesity, a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The The cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was proposed to mediate obesity related insulin resistance upon production in fat cells and to participate in tissue remodelling leading to vascular complications upon being released by macrophages. To  The polymorpism of the TNF-a-308 gene is also involved in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance, therefore, we investigated whether the IRS-1 and TNF-a polymorphism can predict conversion to insulin resistance and obesity parameters in children with obesity.MATERIAL AND In spite of the fact that this cytokine (also known as "cachectin") has been related to many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with cachexia, recent studies suggest that TNF may also have a central role in obesity modulating energy expenditure, fat deposition and insulin resistance. It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals. In this study, we have analyzed the in vivo role of TNF signaling from p55 [TNF receptor (TNFR) 1] and p75 (TNFR 2) TNFR in the development of insulin resistance by generating genetically obese mice (ob/ob) lacking p55 or p75 TNFRs. In this cross-sectional study (n = 498; 258 males, 240 females), association of genotypes (PCR–RFLP) of 11-βHSD1 and TNF-α were analyzed with obesity [BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2), percentage body fat (%BF by DEXA); subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat area (L(2-3) level by single slice MRI) in a sub sample] and insulin resistance. 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-βHSD1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and their role in obesity, regional adiposity and insulin resistance has been sparsely evaluated. To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha. Inhibition of insulin receptor signaling by TNF: potential role in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Increased production of TNF by adipocytes, however, may contribute to insulin resistance in obesity and in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). TNF has been shown to inhibit insulin-simulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and to stimulate downregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in adipocytes. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can contribute to insulin resistance. TNF, but not hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia, is a key driver of obesity-induced monocytosis revealing that inflammatory monocytes correlate with insulin in obese male mice. It is not clear if the extent of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia, underpins changes in cellular immunity during diet-induced obesity. Overall, TNF may function to make the subject less obese by inhibiting LPL and rendering the animal more insulin resistant. TNF is expressed at higher levels in muscle cells of insulin-resistant subjects, and TNF may inhibit LPL expression. When insulin-resistant rodents were injected with anti-TNF binding protein, insulin action improved, suggesting a link between insulin resistance and TNF. These results indicate a role for TNF-alpha in obesity and particularly in the insulin resistance and diabetes that often accompany obesity. Recent studies in animal models have indicated that TNF-alpha plays an important role in mediating the insulin resistance of obesity through its overexpression in fat tissue. TNF-alpha may play a role in mediating insulin resistance associated with obesity. These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action. Recent data have suggested a key role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the insulin resistance of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the insulin resistance associated with obesity, its role in other disorders of obesity is largely unknown. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is overexpressed in obesity and is a candidate mediator of obesity-induced insulin resistance. Such findings support the hypothesis that TNF is a mediator of obesity-linked insulin resistance. This review will summarize the available knowledge on the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and related processes and the potential implications of the above in the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity and insulin resistance.

Target capture and massively parallel sequencing of ultraconserved elements for comparative studies at shallow evolutionary time scales Here, we evaluate the efficacy of genomic markers targeting ultraconserved DNA elements (UCEs) for analyses at shallow evolutionary timescales Because orthologous UCEs can be obtained from a wide array of taxa, are polymorphic at shallow evolutionary timescales, and can be generated rapidly at low cost, they are an effective genetic marker for studies investigating evolutionary patterns and processes at shallow timescales A Phylogenomic Perspective on the Radiation of Ray-Finned Fishes Based upon Targeted Sequencing of Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs) Here, we provide a genomic perspective on longstanding questions regarding the diversification of major groups of ray-finned fishes through targeted enrichment of ultraconserved nuclear DNA elements (UCEs) and their flanking sequence. Our workflow efficiently and economically generates data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those produced by traditional approaches and is well-suited to working with museum specimens. Analysis of the UCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep time-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and Lepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be the earliest diverging teleost lineages. Our approach additionally reveals that sequence capture of UCE regions and their flanking sequence offers enormous potential for resolving phylogenetic relationships within ray-finned fishes We applied a new phylogenomic approach to resolve relationships in Neoaves using target enrichment (sequence capture) and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in avian genomes. We collected sequence data from UCE loci for 32 members of Neoaves and one outgroup (chicken) and analyzed data sets that differed in their amount of missing data More than 1000 ultraconserved elements provide evidence that turtles are the sister group of archosaurs A recent analysis of shared microRNA families found that turtles are more closely related to lepidosaurs. To test this hypothesis with data from many single-copy nuclear loci dispersed throughout the genome, we used sequence capture, high-throughput sequencing and published genomes to obtain sequences from 1145 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and their variable flanking DNA. The resulting phylogeny provides overwhelming support for the hypothesis that turtles evolved from a common ancestor of birds and crocodilians, rejecting the hypothesized relationship between turtles and lepidosaurs Ultraconserved elements anchor thousands of genetic markers spanning multiple evolutionary timescales We introduce a new class of molecular marker, anchored by ultraconserved genomic elements (UCEs), that universally enable target enrichment and sequencing of thousands of orthologous loci across species separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Our analyses here focus on use of UCE markers in Amniota because UCEs and phylogenetic relationships are well-known in some amniotes. We perform an in silico experiment to demonstrate that sequence flanking 2030 UCEs contains information sufficient to enable unambiguous recovery of the established primate phylogeny. We extend this experiment by performing an in vitro enrichment of 2386 UCE-anchored loci from nine, non-model avian species. We then use alignments of 854 of these loci to unambiguously recover the established evolutionary relationships within and among three ancient bird lineages.

5eb504560d431b5f7300000b	What is the function of HP1a in the nucleus?	Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) is an abundant component of heterochromatin, a highly condensed compartment of the nucleus that comprises a major fraction of complex genomes. Both the HP1a hinge and chromo shadow domain independently target heterochromatin, while the HP1c chromo shadow domain is implicated solely in euchromatin localization. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster Piwi was recently reported to associate with chromatin and to interact directly with the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) These results suggest that silkworm Piwi proteins function as a chromatin regulator in collaboration with HP1a and HP1b. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was first described in Drosophila melanogaster as a heterochromatin associated protein required for epigenetic gene silencing. Here we characterized the genome-wide effect of nuclear Piwi elimination on the presence of the heterochromatic H3K9me3 mark and HP1a, as well as on the transcription-associated mark H3K4me2. Our results demonstrate that a significant increase in the H3K4me2 level upon nuclear Piwi loss is not accompanied by the alterations in H3K9me3 and HP1a levels for several germline-expressed transposons, suggesting that in this case Piwi prevents transcription by a mechanism distinct from H3K9 methylation.  Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) The large fraction of heterochromatin in Drosophila neurons is bound by both B-type lamin and HP1a. However, in Kc167 cell culture, the only Drosophilla cell type where LADs have previously been mapped, they are neither H3K9me2-enriched nor overlapped with the domains of heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) Strikingly, contrary to Kc167 cells of embryonic origin, in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in glia and the fat body, HP1a domains appear to overlap strongly with LADs in both the chromosome arms and pericentromeric regions. Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) has been proposed to function downstream of Piwi-piRNA complex in Drosophila. The chromatin of all transgene-associated piRNA clusters contain high levels of trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) and HP1a Su(var) 3-9 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus in Sf9 cells, and interact with histone H3, and the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) and HP1b. An important component of the telomeres is the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is a chromatin-associated protein important for the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin. Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) is an abundant component of heterochromatin, a highly condensed compartment of the nucleus that comprises a major fraction of complex genomes. S ophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid-liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in  Expression of transposable elements in the germline is controlled by Piwi-interacting (pi) RNAs produced by genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and associated with Rhino, a heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog. Pre Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is an epigenetic regulator of chromatin structure and genome function in eukaryotes.  9 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus in Sf9 cells, and interact with histone H3, and the heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) and HP1b. A dose-depend Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) is a highly conserved and versatile epigenetic factor that can both silence and activate transcription. Here, we show that Eyg forms a protein complex with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. HP1a is an evolutionarily conserved heterochromatin-associated protein, which plays an essential role in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) is a well-known conserved protein involved in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in different species including humans. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a in Drosophila) is a conserved eukaryotic chromosomal protein that is prominently associated with pericentric heterochromatin and mediates the concomitant gene silencing. Heterochromatin protein 1a functions for piRNA biogenesis predominantly from pericentric and telomeric regions in Drosophila. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is an epigenetic regulator of chromatin structure and genome function in eukaryotes.

5c6dfba77c78d69471000046	Describe the mechanism of action of apalutamide.	Second-generation NSAA receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide) are emerging as additional new options to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Apalutamide, a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor, is under development for the treatment of prostate cancer. Apalutamide (ARN-509) is an antiandrogen that binds selectively to androgen receptors (AR) and does not show antagonist-to-agonist switch like bicalutamide.  Apalutamide is a pure androgen antagonist with a very high affinity with the androgen receptor. Apalutamide (ARN-509), a second-generation androgen receptor antagonist, recently received approval in the nonmetastatic (M0) CRPC space. Similar to enzalutamide, apalutamide inhibits the binding of androgen to androgen receptor (AR), nuclear translocation of the androgen-AR complex, and binding of AR transcription complex to DNA-binding sites and transcription elements.  Apalutamide (ErleadaTM) is a next-generation oral androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that is being developed by Janssen for the treatment of prostate cancer (PC). It binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the AR and blocks the effects of androgens.  Ongoing clinical trials for different subgroups of prostate cancer patients include the evaluation of the second-generation AR antagonists enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, of inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, of inhibitors of DNA damage response, of targeted alpha therapy and of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting approaches.   One of these agents is apalutamide, which seems to be a promising AR antagonist for the treatment of CRPC. Expert opinion: Apalutamide is an oral, investigational, AR antagonist that targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets.

515d71ee298dcd4e5100000b	What is known about Vancomycin dosing in neonates?	Monte Carlo simulations based on our population pharmacokinetic model suggest that vancomycin dosing guidelines based on serum creatinine concentration have a greater likelihood of achieving trough concentrations in the 5-15-mg/L range compared with other evaluated dosing regimens. None of the four dosing regimens is suitable to produce target trough concentration of 15-20 mg/L in an acceptable number of patients. There is significant variation in gentamicin and vancomycin dosing regimens and TDM guidance across a UK network of neonatal units. The development of standardized, evidence-based protocols should be prioritized. Vancomycin, by contrast, was associated with ototoxicity. There is no consensus on vancomycin dosing in newborns and young infants. The modified regimen for a target vancomycin concentration of 25 mg/l consisted of a bolus of 20 mg/kg followed by continuous infusion of 30 mg/kg. There is no ideal pattern of vancomycin dosing; vancomycin dosages must be individualized. Recommended vancomycin schedules for term newborn infants with neonatal sepsis should be based on the weight and postconceptual age only to start antimicrobial therapy. There is Targets were a trough concentration between 5 and 15 mg/L and a peak below 40 mg/L. In the prospective study, the optimal scheme was tested in 22 patients. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients, 34.3% of measured trough concentrations and 17.6% of peak concentrations were outside the desired therapeutic range. The model that best fitted the data included clearance and volume per kilogram and was independent of gestational age. Simulation of various dosing schemes showed that a dosing schedule of 30 mg/kg/day, irrespective of gestational age, in three doses was optimal, and this scheme was prospectively tested. Mean trough concentrations before the second dose were 8.2 +/- 2.2 mg/L versus a predicted trough of 8.9 +/- 2.5 mg/L. No peak levels higher than 40 mg/L were found. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the proposed schedule leads to adequate vancomycin trough serum concentrations, and there is no need for routine monitoring of peak serum concentrations. Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity is rare in neonates, even with serum peak concentrations >40 microg/mL. Infants weighing less than 1,000 gm had significantly larger volumes of drug distribution and consequently longer drug half-lives than larger premature infants, regardless of postconceptual or actual age. These differences alter the vancomycin dosing recommendations in these two groups of premature infants. We recommend initial dosage regimens consisting of a loading dose of vancomycin of 25 mg/kg followed by doses of 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for infants with weights less than 1,000 gm. Infants weighing over 1,000 gm should receive 10 mg/kg every 12 hours, with a loading dose of 12.5 mg/kg. Serum vancomycin concentration should be monitored, however, for final optimization of therapy.	['Staphylococcus epidermis, including methicillin-resistant strains, are inhibited by vancomycin concentrations of 1-4 µg/ml. \nStaphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Streptococcus viridans are susceptible to 2 µg/ml vancomycin. \nBacillus spp. are inhibited by 2 µg/ml, Corynebacterium spp. by 0.04-3.1 µg/ml and Clostridium spp. by 0.39-6 µg/ml vancomycin. \nPeak and trough concentrations of vancomycin should be 40 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively, to both be effective and avoid oto- or nephrotoxicity in adults. There is no ideal pattern of vancomycin dosing; vancomycin dosages must be individualized. Because vancomycin activity is primarily time-dependent, the 24-h area under the curve (AUC0-24h) divided by the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) value (AUC0-24h/MIC) is a better predictor of efficacy. In adults with MIC values less than 1 μg/ml, trough concentrations greater than 10 µg/ml result in AUC0-24h/MIC values 400\nCompared with adults, neonates have a higher extracellular fluid volume and a limited renal elimination capacity resulting in different pharmacokinetics subject to maturation stage.

5abcf108fcf4565872000025	What is myelin?	Myelination is a recent evolutionary addition that significantly enhances the speed of transmission in the neural network. . Myelin is only formed by fully differentiated oligodendrocytes, but the entire oligodendrocyte lineage are clear targets of the altered chemistry of the aging brain Formation of myelin sheaths by Schwann cells (SCs) enables rapid and efficient transmission of action potentials in peripheral axons, and disruption of myelination results in disorders that involve decreased sensory and motor functions. Myelin is a specialized structure of the nervous system that both enhances electrical conductance and insulates neurons from external risk factors.  polarized oligodendrocytes form myelin by wrapping processes in a spiral pattern around neuronal axons through myelin-related gene regulation. Myelin - the multilayer membrane that envelops axons - is a facilitator of rapid nerve conduction. Myelin allows for the rapid and precise timing of action potential propagation along neuronal circuits and is essential for healthy auditory system function. Myelin sheaths in the vertebrate nervous system enable faster impulse propagation, while myelinating glia provide vital support to axons. Myelin consists of tightly compacted membranes that form an insulating sheath around axons Myelin is a biologically active mutilamellar that is formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the central nervous system (CNS) and ensheathes axons  The myelin sheath is a multilayered membrane in the nervous system, which has unique biochemical properties.

5e722812c6a8763d2300000a	What do HA and NA stand for with respect to the flue virus, e.g. H1N1?	neuraminidase (NA)  Genetic variation of influenza neuraminidase (NA), unlike for hemagglutinin (HA), has not been fully characterized.  VaxArray assays for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have been developed to address this need.  Antibody (Ab) responses and protection against influenza virus infection in mice immunized intranasally with hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) purified from the A/Beijing/262/95 (A/Beijing) (H1N1) virus were compared among B10 congenic mouse strains. Since antibodies against HA and neuraminidase (NA) contribute independently to protection against disease, antigenic changes in NA may allow A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to escape from vaccine-induced immunity. The ability of plasmid DNA encoding hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) or matrix protein (M1) from influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1), and mixtures of these plasmid DNAs (HA + NA and HA + NA + M1) to protect against homologous or heterologous virus infection was examined in BALB/c mice. ODS: Alignments were made with H1N1 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (HA and NA, respectively) sequences; only conserved sites were used for antigenicity prediction. Two LTS: In this report, 72 hemagglutinin (HA) and 45 neuraminidase (NA) H1N1 virus gene sequences, isolated in 2009 from various regions of Saudi Arabia, were analyzed. Gen Two surface glycoproteins of influenza virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), play opposite roles in terms of their interaction with host sialic acid receptors. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are major glycoproteins expressed on the surface of influenza virus. UNLABELLED: In nearly all characterized influenza viruses, hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding protein while neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-cleaving protein that aids in vi The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) external glycoprotein antigens of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of epidemiologically important influenza A viruses prevalent during recent decades were subjected to intensive antigenic analysis by four different methods. In the vast majority of influenza A viruses characterized to date, hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding and fusion protein, whereas neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-cleaving protein that facilitates viral release but is expendable for entry. The ability of a single dose of plasmid DNA encoding neuraminidase (NA) or hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) to protect against homologous virus infection was examined in BALB/c mice. Antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins are the major mediators of protection against influenza virus infection. Previous studies have suggested that Cal-derived chimeric hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) improve virus yields. Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes based on their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are two glycoproteins in this lipid membrane; namely, hemagglutinin (HA) which helps in attachment of the viral strain on the host cell surface and neuraminidase (NA) that is responsible for initiation of viral infection.

DNA methylation is important for gene silencing and imprinting in both plants and animals. Recent advances in bisulfite sequencing allow detection of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) achieving high sensitivity, but accurately identifying heterozygous SNVs from partially C-to-T converted sequences remains challenging.Results: We designed two methods, BayesWC and BinomWC, that substantially improved the precision of heterozygous SNV calls from ∼80% to 99% while retaining comparable recalls. With these SNV calls, we provided functions for allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) analysis and visualizing the methylation status on reads. Applying ASM analysis to a previous dataset, we found that an average of 1.5% of investigated regions showed allelic methylation, which were significantly enriched in transposon elements and likely to be shared by the same cell-type.

54f48cb74e9bf3263f000001	What is known about type D personality trait in cancer patients?	RESULTS: Nineteen percent of patients (n=572) had a Type D personality. The perceived receipt of disease-specific (mean 46 vs. 51), medical test (56 vs. 63) and treatment information (37 vs. 42) was significantly lower for Type D patients compared with non-Type Ds as assessed with the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 (scales 0-100; all ps<0.01). Cancer patients with a Type D personality were less satisfied with the received information (49 vs. 58; p<0.01) and found the received information less useful (55 vs. 61; p<0.01) compared with non-Type Ds. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that Type D personality was independently associated with information about the disease (Beta=-0.09), medical tests (Beta=-0.12) and treatment (Beta=-0.08), and with satisfaction with information received (OR=0.54; 95%CI=0.44-0.66;all ps<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that patients with a Type D personality perceived that they received less information and reported less satisfaction with the amount of received information as compared with non-Type D patients. RESULTS: 750 (19%) patients had a Type D personality. They believe their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. Also, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often influences them emotionally. Differences regarding 'consequences', 'concern' and 'emotional response' were also clinically relevant. Significant differences in perceptions on cause of disease between Type Ds and non-Type Ds were found for psychological distress (16.2 vs. 10.9%; p<0.01), randomness (1.7 vs. 5.3%; p<0.01) and unknown (18.8 vs. 24.4%; p<0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that Type D was negatively associated with 'coherence' and positively with 'consequences', 'timeline', 'identity', 'concern', and 'emotional representation'. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the associations between personality and illness perceptions, demonstrating their close interrelatedness. Our study may be helpful in further developing theoretical models regarding giving meaning to illness and the illness perceptions that the illness elicits. Future studies should investigate whether interventions can positively impact illness perceptions of Type D cancer patients. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of survivors had a type D personality. Over a 12-month period, type D survivors significantly more often reported osteoarthritis, back pain, and depression than non-type D survivors. Also, type D survivors more often reported to feel bothered by high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, heart disease, depression, diabetes and lung disease during daily activities. Type D survivors more often visited their general practitioner than non-type D survivors (P<.001), also in relation to cancer (0 visits: 54% vs. 60%; 1-5: 28% vs. 22%; >5: 9% vs. 5%; P<.001), as well as their specialist (0 visits: 6% vs. 7%; 1-5 visits: 59% vs. 64%; >5 visits: 30% vs. 23%; P<.01). CONCLUSION: Type D personality is a vulnerability factor that may help to identify subgroups of cancer survivors who are at an increased risk for comorbidity burden and increased health care utilization. Type D (distressed) personality is associated with poor quality of life and mental health among 3080 cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors with a Type D personality are at increased risk of impaired QoL and mental health problems that cannot be explained by socio-demographic or clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Patients with type D personality experienced higher physical and psychological distress than those with non-type D personality. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of survivors (n=125) were classified as Type D. They reported a clinically and statistically significant worse general health (57.8 versus 75.6), social functioning (73.1 versus 88.7), mental health (61.7 versus 80.6), more emotional role limitations (67.8 versus 89.4) and less vitality (54.5 versus 72.8) than non-Type D patients. Additionally, they reported a statistically and clinically relevant higher impact of cancer on body changes, negative self-evaluation, negative outlook on life, life interferences and health worry. Furthermore, they were more worried about the influence of the sun on their skin and acted accordingly. No differences were found in health care utilisation.

Features of this newly recognized clinical disorder include multiple-suture synostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, Chiari malformation and language delay. Mice with functional Erf levels reduced to ∼30% of normal exhibit postnatal multiple-suture synostosis; by contrast, embryonic calvarial development appears mildly delayed	['Reduced dosage of ERF, which encodes an inhibitory ETS transcription factor directly bound by ERK1/2 causes complex craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures) in humans and mice.

530e42bf5937551c09000005	What is the role of edaravone in traumatic brain injury?	 The edaravone-treated animals also exhibited higher rCBF in the contralateral hemisphere compared with that seen in -vehicle-treated animals. It is suggested that edaravone reduces neuronal damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by maintaining intact the autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature. Edaravone administration after CCI resulted in a significant reduction in the injury volume and oxidative stress, particularly at the 3-hour time point. Moreover, the greatest decrease in O2 (∙-) levels was observed when edaravone was administered 3 hours following CCI. These findings suggest that edaravone could prove clinically useful to ameliorate the devastating effects of TBI. Edaravone significantly suppressed axonal injury and oxidative stress in the cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus 24h after injury.  These results suggest that edaravone protects against memory deficits following TBI and that this protection is mediated by suppression of TAI and oxidative stress. Concordantly, edaravone has been found to have neuroprotective effects in a number of animal models of disease, including stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors.  Free-radical scavenger edaravone treatment confers neuroprotection against traumatic brain injury in rats. Edaravone treatment significantly decreased hippocampal CA3 neuron loss, reduced oxidative stress, and decreased neuronal programmed cell death compared to vehicle treatment.  Lastly, edaravone treatment significantly reduced the presence of inflammatory cytokines, cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and, importantly, neurological deficits following TBI. Our results suggest that edaravone exerts a neuroprotective effect in the rat model of TBI. The likely mechanism is via inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to a decreased inflammatory response and glial activation, and thereby reducing neuronal death and improving neurological function. After treatment with edaravone, the degree of morphological injury, p-ERK1/2 level and number of apoptotic neurons decreased, latent period to find the safety platform was significantly shortened (in low-dose edaravone treatment group, p-ERK1/2 expression level at 6, 24, 48 hours was 2.46 + or - 0.22, 4.00 + or - 0.84, 2.38 + or - 0.32, and in high-dose edaravone treatment group was 1.67 + or - 0.15, 1.86 + or - 0.38, 1.27 + or - 0.28; in low-dose edaravone treatment group, the apoptotic cells at 6, 24, 48, 72 hours was 5.20 + or - 1.23, 7.10 + or - 1.72, 9.54 + or - 1.36, 14.12 + or - 3.19, and in high-dose edaravone treatment group was 3.40 + or - 0.49 , 4.39 + or - 0.73, 5.02 + or - 1.12, 8.78 + or - 2.16; in low-dose edaravone treatment group, latent period to find the safety platform at 7-10 days was 94.8 + or - 22.8, 65.2 + or - 19.0, 62.0 + or - 16.7, 59.5 + or - 15.6, and in high-dose edaravone treatment group it was 81.5 + or - 20.7, 55.4 + or - 18.5, 40.0 + or - 12.3, 32.2 + or - 11.0, all P<0.05). High-dose edaravone showed a better effect (all P<0.05).  Edaravone gives good therapeutic effect on severe TBI, and the molecular mechanism is related to attenuation of ERK1/2 pathway and neuronal apoptosis following severe brain trauma. Numbers of 8-OHdG-, 4-HNE-, and ssDNA-positive cells around the damaged area after TBI were significantly decreased in the edaravone group compared with the saline group (P < 0.01). There was a significant increase in neuronal cell number and improvement in cerebral dysfunction after TBI in the edaravone group compared with the saline group (P < 0.01). Edaravone administration following TBI inhibited free radical-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptotic cell death around the damaged area. In summary, edaravone treatment improved cerebral dysfunction following TBI, suggesting its potential as an effective clinical therapy. Edaravone administration inhibited production of free radicals known to induce neuronal degeneration and cell death after brain injury, and protected nestin-positive cells, including NSCs, with the potential to differentiate into neurons and glia around the area damaged by TBI. Under specific experimental conditions, edaravone minimized traumatic brain injury by functioning as a synthetic antioxidant.  Thus, edaravone can scavenge OR- and significantly reduce levels of these radicals in TBI patients.	['Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury. In animal models, edaravone has been shown to reduce neuronal damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintain intact the autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature, decrease neuronal loss, reduce programmed cell death, the presence of inflammatory cytokines, cerebral edema, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability.

51718fbc8ed59a060a000010	What is the mechanism of microRNA deregulation in carcinogenesis?	MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by interacting with the 3'UTR of protein-coding mRNA. MicroRNAs are implicated in nearly all major biological and cellular events, and recent findings further link microRNA deregulation to human carcinogenesis. MiR-657 promotes tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting transducin-like enhancer protein 1 through NF-κB pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs, are involved in diverse biological functions and carcinogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-106b downregulates APC expression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of APC messenger RNA. Furthermore, miRNAs present a mechanism by which genes with diverse functions on multiple pathways can be simultaneously regulated at the post-transcriptional level. However, little is known about the cancer-related pathways through which cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) regulate these processes representing either positive or negative functions in carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs, known as small noncoding MiRNAs, 19 to 24 nt in length, are important gene regulators and recognized as key players in carcinogenesis. The mechanism lies in that the MiRNAs can conjugate with their targeted mRNA and then lead to the targeted mRNA degradation or repress their translation. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that each MiRNA can regulate hundreds of gene targets and could serve functionally as "oncogenes" or "tumor suppressor genes", and therefore regulate multiple cellular processes relevant to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. microRNAs (miRs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that are aberrantly expressed in various carcinomas. While deregulated miRNA expression levels have been detected in many tumors, whether miRNA functional impairment is also involved in carcinogenesis remains unknown. In the last years, microRNAs (miRNA) have emerged as new molecular players involved in carcinogenesis. Deregulation of miRNAs expression has been shown in different human cancer but the molecular mechanism underlying the alteration of miRNA expression is unknown. These are microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs, 20-23 nucleotides in length, that can up or downregulate gene expression of downstream gene targets (including transcription factors, oncogenes, and tumour suppressor genes) at the post-transcriptional level. Some members of this new class of genes seem to have the potential to act simultaneously either as oncogenes or as tumour suppressor genes depending on the molecular microenvironment of the cell. MicroRNAs can also be affected by chromosomal alterations and thus contribute to carcinogenesis. Regulation of hepatocarcinogenesis by microRNAs. MicroRNAs are implicated in nearly all major biological and cellular events, and recent findings further link microRNA deregulation to human carcinogenesis. miR-106b downregulates adenomatous polyposis coli and promotes cell proliferation in human hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known about the cancer-related pathways through which cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) regulate these processes representing either positive or negative functions in carcinogenesis. Combined with previous cancer studies, the analysis of the relevance between functions of CA-miRNAs and cancer-related pathways exploring different internal carcinogenesis stimuli also revealed the potential of the top five pathways to regulate core carcinogenesis processes. MicroRNAs, known as small noncoding MiRNAs, 19 to 24 nt in length, are important gene regulators and recognized as key players in carcinogenesis. Androgen pathway stimulates microRNA-216a transcription to suppress the tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 gene in early hepatocarcinogenesis. Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is common in advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the ones involved in early carcinogenesis have not yet been investigated. MicroRNA-375 targets AEG-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and suppresses liver cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to have fundamental roles in tumorigenesis and have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, the roles of miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinogenesis are still not fully elucidated. Growing evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to tumorigenesis. UNLABELLED: Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is common in advanced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the ones involved in early carcinogenesis have not yet been investigated. Deregulation of miRNAs expression has been shown in different human cancer but the molecular mechanism underlying the alteration of miRNA expression is unknown.	['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-protein coding single-stranded RNAs (19–25 nucleotides in length) generated from  cleavage of larger non-coding RNAs by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer. They become part of the RNA-induced silencing complex and negatively regulate gene expression by binding to homologous 3\'-UTR region of target protein-coding mRNAs as an imperfect match, causing translational repression or degradation. Approximately one-third of the protein-coding genes are susceptible to miRNA regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with the onset and progression of a number of human cancers. Therefore, cancer-associated miRNAs (CA-miRNAs) could regulate target genes by acting either as "oncogenes" or "tumor suppressor miRNA (TS-miRNAs)". In line with this, numerous cancers (e.g. breast, lung, oesophageal, prostate, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancer) have been classified based on their unique miRNA expression profile.']

5a7602be83b0d9ea6600000f	Describe King–Kopetzky syndrome.	At least 10% of people who present for help with hearing difficulties will be found to have normal hearing thresholds. These cases are clinically categorized as King-Kopetzky syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory processing disorder (APD). Illness perceptions and hearing difficulties in King-Kopetzky syndrome: what determines help seeking? The present study explored illness perceptions of hearing difficulties amongst one hundred participants who reported experiencing hearing difficulties despite normal audiometric thresholds. This experience is referred to as King-Kopetzky syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory processing disorder (APD). Decreases in DPOAE level appear to represent evidence of minor cochlear pathology, and provide a pathological basis for the difficulty of hearing speech in the presence of background noise, which characterizes King-Kopetzky syndrome. The principal symptom of subjects suffering from King-Kopetzky syndrome is a perceived difficulty in recognizing and understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. For some patients, minor disturbances in auditory function, e.g. a deteriorated signal-to-noise ratio for speech, can be demonstrated; for others, all measurements of hearing are normal.  King Kopetzky Syndrome (KKS) is a common condition in which individuals with normal audiograms complain of hearing difficulties, particularly in noisy places. King-Kopetzky syndrome (Obscure Auditory Dysfunction, OAD) has been recognized as a clinically distinct condition in audiological and ENT clinics. It is characterized by normal hearing thresholds on pure tone audiometry (PTA) but complaints of difficulties in understanding speech in the presence of background noise. King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically normal hearing threshold. The main reported disability is hearing speech in the presence of background noise.  Hearing complaints of patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome (obscure auditory dysfunction). The main findings are that complaints were commonly focused on the categories of 'live speech' and 'electronic speech' difficulties in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome, particularly the auditory difficulties of speech in noise and group conversation.

51659356298dcd4e5100005a	How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification?	Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. This approach identified Txr1p as a histone methyltransferase in Tetrahymena thermophila and characterized the relationships of the Txr1p and Ezl2p methyltransferases to histone H3 modification. Histone methyltransferases catalyze site-specific deposition of methyl groups, enabling recruitment of transcriptional regulators. In mammals, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3, a modification localized at the transcription start sites of active genes, is catalyzed by six enzymes (SET1a and SET1b, MLL1-MLL4) whose specific functions are largely unknown.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by covalent modification of histones is important for germ line cell development. In mammals, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific histone methyltransferases (HMTases), such as G9a, SETDB1, and SUV39H, play critical roles, but the contribution of H3K9-specific HMTases in Drosophila remains to be clarified, especially in male sperm. By analyzing the distribution of histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a DCC-dependent manner.   Here, we found the epigenetic modification of the BZLF1 promoter in latent Raji cells by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), H3K9me2/me3, and H4K20me3.  Although DNA methyltransferases have been shown to interact with histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 27) and G9a (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 9), the relationship between DNA methylation and repressive histone marks has not been fully studied.  Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.  Histone H3-lysine (K) 4, H3-K9 and H3-K27 modifications in all these four genes were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in HCC cell lines.  The histone H4 N-terminal tail has long been regarded as a major regulator in chromatin structure and function. Gene transcription is critically influenced by chromatin structure and the modification status of histone tails. Methylation of lysine residues in histone tails is dynamically regulated by the opposing activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases. The SAS3-dependent NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex was originally identified on the basis of its ability to acetylate histone H3 in vitro. SU(VAR)3-9 like histone methyltransferases control heterochromatic domains in eukaryotes. Methylation of position-specific lysine residues in histone N termini is a central modification for regulating epigenetic transitions in chromatin. Each methylatable lysine residue can exist in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated state, thereby extending the indexing potential of this particular modification.  One of these modifications, histone lysine methylation, has been shown to be highly stable and to represent an epigenetic alteration. Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. Set9, a novel histone H3 methyltransferase that facilitates transcription by precluding histone tail modifications required for heterochromatin formation. Our results suggest that the methylation of histone tails can have distinct effects on transcription, depending on its chromosomal location, the combination of posttranslational modifications, and the enzyme (or protein complex) involved in the particular modification. Among the different groups of enzymes known to catalyze the covalent modification, the most recent additions are the histone methyltransferases (HMTases), whose functions are now being characterized.	['Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are responsible for the site-specific addition of covalent modifications on the histone tails, which serve as markers for the recruitment of chromatin organization complexes. There are two major types of HMTs: histone-lysine N-Methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases. The former methylate specific lysine (K) residues such as 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79 on histone H3 and residue 20 on histone H4. The latter methylate arginine (R) residues such as 2, 8, 17, and 26 on histone H3 and residue 3 on histone H4. Depending on what residue is modified and the degree of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation), lysine methylation of histones is linked to either transcriptionally active or silent chromatin.']
58848822e56acf517600000c	What is the mechanism of action of Osimertinib?	In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib).  Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are presently in clinical use. Understanding resistance mechanisms has led to the identification of a secondary mutational target, T790M, in more than half of patients, for which osimertinib has been approved.  Third-generation EGFR TKIs against the T790M mutation have been in active clinical development. These agents include osimertinib, rociletinib, HM61713, ASP8273, EGF816, and PF-06747775.  PURPOSE: Osimertinib (AZD9291) 80 mg once daily is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC whose disease has previously progressed on EGFR-TKI therapy. Osimertinib PK was evaluated to define the dose and dosing interval, whether a fixed-dosing approach can be used globally, and the impact of formulation and food on exposure. RECENT FINDINGS: Third-generation TKIs in clinical development include osimertinib, rociletinib, and HM61713. In this study, we investigated the interaction between ABCB1 and osimertinib, a novel selective, irreversible third-generation EGFR TKI that has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Considering that osimertinib is a clinically approved third-generation EGFR TKI, our findings suggest that a combination therapy with osimertinib and conventional anticancer drugs may be beneficial to patients with MDR tumors. In our study, we investigated whether osimertinib (AZD9291), a third-generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both activating EGFR mutations and resistance-associated T790M point mutation, could reverse MDR induced by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo Our results showed that osimertinib significantly increased the sensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cells to their substrate chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in the model of ABCB1-overexpressing KBv200 cell xenograft in nude mice.  The potency of 1st (erlotinib), 2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express mutated or wild type EGFR Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso™), an oral, third-generation EGFR TKI, has been designed to target the EGFR T790M mutation, while sparing wild-type EGFR. Early phase clinical data suggest the third generation EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib, rociletinib, and HM61713 are highly efficacious and well tolerated. We review the rapid clinical development and approval of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib for treatment of NSCLCs with EGFR-T790M.

Transcriptional silencing of the Wnt-antagonist DKK1 by promoter methylation is associated with enhanced Wnt signaling DKK1 itself is a target of TCF/β-catenin mediated transcription, these findings suggest that DKK1 is part of a negative feedback loop in MM and may act as a tumor suppressor. Continuous antagonism by Dkk1 counter activates canonical Wnt signaling Dkk1-dependent inhibition of Wnt signaling Wnt inhibition caused by the AVE-derived Dkk1, Wnt signal inhibitors, Dkk1 or XAV939 DKK1 antagonizes Wnt signaling DKK1 is a secreted protein that antagonizes Wnt signaling and plays essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis One model suggests that DKK1 binding to LRP6 disrupts Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP6 complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that DKK1 interaction with LRP6 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation, thereby reducing the cell surface LRP6 level.  We conclude that DKK1 inhibition of LRP6 is independent of LRP6 internalization and degradation. DKK1 mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling  Here we demonstrate that tetracycline-regulated expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in TECs localized in both the cortex and medulla of adult mice Removal of DKK1 from DKK1-involuted mice results in full recovery, suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is required for the differentiation or proliferation of TEC populations Suppression of Wnt signaling by Dkk1 DKK1-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling. n vitro studies suggest that a reduced antagonistic effect of DKK1 on canonical Wnt signaling contributes to the molecular effect of this mutation and its pathogenic consequence. Wnt signal activation in the absence and presence of DKK1 was assessed using a TCF4-based reporter gene assay in Saos-2 cells DKK1, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway. The role of the Wnt-signaling antagonist DKK1 in the development We found that dkk1 blocks the post-MBT Wnt signaling and dkk1 is a target of the pre-MBT Wnt signaling. Our findings further demonstrated that miR-217 promoted the CSC-like phenotype via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) targeting, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling Specifically, TNFα triggered induction of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk1 in the osteoblasts at the mRNA and protein levels, with a simultaneous increase in RANKL Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response to Wnts. Forced overexpression of DKK1 antagonized the effects of GATA6 on Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. DKK1 is a secreted protein that antagonizes Wnt signaling and plays essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including head induction, skeletal development, and limb patterning. In vitro studies suggest that a reduced antagonistic effect of DKK1 on canonical Wnt signaling contributes to the molecular effect of this mutation and its pathogenic consequence. DKK1 antagonizes Wnt signaling without promotion of LRP6 internalization and degradation. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether the anti-MM effect of T3E could be mediated via the epigenetic alteration of the Wnt antagonist gene, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is known to antagonize Wnt signaling by direct high-affinity binding to the extracellular domain of WNT coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). f-related protein 1 (Dkk1), a vital antagonist of the Wnt signaling, was reported to be closely associated with bone homeostasis and osteoporosis. Interest gnaling. Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response t These results indicate the efficacy of systemic expression of secreted Wnt antagonists as a general strategy for conditional inactivation of Wnt signaling in adult organisms and illustrate a striking reliance on a single growth factor pathway for the maintenance of the architecture of the adult small intestine and colon. Along these lines, one mechanism through which E2 protects the hippocampus from cerebral ischemia is by preventing the post-ischemic elevation of Dkk1, a neurodegenerative factor that serves as an antagonist of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and simultaneously inducing pro-survival Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in hippocampal neurons. Specifically, we revealed a mechanism by which IL1β upregulates WNT signaling via downregulating WNT antagonists, DKK1 and FRZB. DKK1 is a high affinity antagonistic ligand for LRP6, which is a Wnt coreceptor that acts together with the Frizzled serpentine receptor to initiate Wnt signal transduction. Two different models have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function.

5509ce9ec2af5d5b70000001	What colonoscopy findings have been reported in autism	Autistic enterocolitis: fact or fiction? There have been several reports of a link between autism and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Endoscopy trials have demonstrated a higher prevalence of nonspecific colitis, lymphoid hyperplasia and focally enhanced gastritis compared with controls. Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) One hundred and forty-eight consecutive children with ASD (median age 6 years; range 2-16; 127 male) with gastrointestinal symptoms were investigated by ileo-colonoscopy. Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. Differences in age at colonoscopy and diet do not account for these changes. The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children. Ileo-colonoscopy was performed in 21 consecutively evaluated children with autistic spectrum disorders and bowel symptoms Immunohistochemistry confirms a distinct lymphocytic colitis in autistic spectrum disorders in which the epithelium appears particularly affected. This is consistent with increasing evidence for gut epithelial dysfunction in autism.  Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one) A new variant of inflammatory bowel disease is present in this group of children with developmental disorders. Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001).

517138d98ed59a060a000003	How does ranolazine affect calcium handling in the heart	Ranolazine and lidocaine (10 μM) similarly reduced Ca2+i overload and improved left ventricle work recovery in whole-heart models of IR injury or exposure to ouabain (80 μM). Ranolazine (10 μM), but not lidocaine (10 μM), reduced RM NCX1.1-mediated Ca2+i overload in ventricular myocytes. Blockade of the late inward sodium current, late I(Na), offers another target for the treatment of ischemia. Blockade of late I(Na) reduces the sodium and calcium overload that follows ischemia. Ranolazine, a late I(Na) inhibitor, has been shown to provide both anti-anginal and anti-ischemic benefits without significant alterations in the heart rate and blood pressure in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Ranolazine is a new antianginal drug that reduces intracellular sodium and calcium accumulation during ischemia, thus potentially limiting myocardial ischemia. Detergent extracted fiber bundles from DOCA-salt hearts demonstrated increased myofilament response to Ca(2+) with glutathionylation of myosin binding protein C. Treatment with ranolazine ameliorated the Ca(2+) response and cross-bridge kinetics. Ran reduces P(o) of RyR2, desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations, Ranolazine may provide functional protection of the heart during IR injury by reducing cCa2+ and mCa2+ loading secondary to its effect to block the late Na+ current. Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis. By preventing myocyte sodium and calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on myocardial function. Reduction by RAN of I(Na,L)-induced dysregulation of calcium cycling could contribute to the antiarrhythmic actions of this agent in both reentrant and triggered arrhythmias. Moreover, in rabbit myocytes the increases in late I(Na), [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) caused by ATX-II, were significantly blunted by ranolazine. These results suggest that ranolazine may be of therapeutic benefit in conditions of diastolic dysfunction due to elevated [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i). Ranolazine is a selective inhibitor of the late sodium current relative to peak sodium channel current, and via this mechanism, it may decrease sodium-dependent intracellular calcium overload during ischemia and reperfusion. he beneficial effects of ranolazine in reducing Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion is consistent with the inhibition of late INa mechanism of action. Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload Ranolazine selectively inhibits late I(Na), reduces [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarisation and contractility that are associated with ischaemia/reperfusion and heart failure. The results indicate that ranolazine, at concentrations which have significantly beneficial effects during ischaemic episodes, only greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation. Ranolazine had only a small effect on the basal calcium current	['Ranolazine has only a small effect on the basal calcium current, while it greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation.\nRanolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload.\nRanolazine reduces Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion.\nranolazine decreases  I(Na,L)-induced dysregulation of calcium cycling that contributes to the antiarrhythmic actions of this agent.\nranolazine desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations.\nranolazine ameliorates the Ca(2+) response and cross-bridge kinetics of cardiac myofilaments.']

Tyrosine kinase (PtkA;TK) activated by autophosphorylation; phosphorylates TP, which subsequently leads to increase in its phosphatase activity Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA).  Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylates Toll-like receptor 4 to dissociate MyD88 and Mal/Tirap, suppressing LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR) Selective inhibition reveals cyclin-dependent kinase 2 as another kinase that phosphorylates the androgen receptor at serine 81. Aurora A kinase phosphorylates Hec1 to regulate metaphase kinetochore-microtubule dynamics. Central to this regulation is Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to promote microtubule turnover.

5e36de90b5b409ea5300000e	What is the role of the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction in yeast?	Role of the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction in cleavage-furrow ingression and primary-septum formation during yeast cytokinesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is well established that Hof1, Cyk3, and Inn1 contribute to septum formation and cytokinesis. Because hof1∆ and cyk3∆ single mutants have relatively mild defects but hof1∆ cyk3∆ double mutants are nearly dead, it has been hypothesized that these proteins contribute to parallel pathways. However, there is also evidence that they interact physically. In this study, we examined this interaction and its functional significance in detail. Our data indicate that the interaction 1) is mediated by a direct binding of the Hof1 SH3 domain to a proline-rich motif in Cyk3; 2) occurs specifically at the time of cytokinesis but is independent of the (hyper)phosphorylation of both proteins that occurs at about the same time; 3) is dispensable for the normal localization of both proteins; 4) is essential for normal primary-septum formation and a normal rate of cleavage-furrow ingression; and 5) becomes critical for growth when either Inn1 or the type II myosin Myo1 (a key component of the contractile actomyosin ring) is absent. The similarity in phenotype between cyk3∆ mutants and mutants specifically lacking the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction suggests that the interaction is particularly important for Cyk3 function, but it may be important for Hof1 function as well.

RHS6 recruited transcription factors GATA3, SATB1, and IRF4, which play important roles in expression of all three Th2 cytokine genes posttranslational modifications of Gata3 that control the regulation of IFNγ expression in memory Th2 cells. GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2 differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation. Genome-wide analysis reveals unique regulation of transcription of Th2-specific genes by GATA3  IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation induces high levels of transcription of GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation, and enforced expression of GATA3 induces Th2 cytokine expression. T-bet and GATA3 orchestrate Th1 and Th2 differentiation through lineage-specific targeting of distal regulatory elements. T-bet and GATA3 regulate the CD4+ T cell Th1/Th2 cell fate decision but little is known about the interplay between these factors outside of the murine Ifng and Il4/Il5/Il13 loci We propose these aspects of T-bet and GATA3 function are important for Th1/Th2 differentiation and for understanding transcription factor interactions in other T cell lineage decisions. T helper 2 cells regulate inflammatory responses to helminth infections while also mediating pathological processes of asthma and allergy. IL-4 promotes Th2 development by inducing the expression of the GATA3 transcription factor, and the Th2 phenotype is stabilized by a GATA3-dependent autoregulatory loop. Type I IFN reverses human Th2 commitment and stability by suppressing GATA3. Our results suggest that the balance of Runx3 and GATA3 is one factor that influences the manifestation of CD4(+) cells as the Th1 or Th2 phenotypes. Moreover, the expression of the Th2 transcription factor, GATA3, was significantly reduced in PKCtheta-deficient T cells. Impaired GATA3-dependent chromatin remodeling and Th2 cell differentiation leading to attenuated allergic airway inflammation in aging mice In addition, reduced expression of GATA3 was detected in developing Th2 cells.  transduction of Runx1 into wild-type T cells caused a complete attenuation of Th2 differentiation and was accompanied by the cessation of GATA3 expression A critical role for NF-kappa B in GATA3 expression and TH2 differentiation in allergic airway inflammation.

55031d82e9bde6963400002c	What is the association between adiponectin and migraine?	Increase in body fat, especially in gluteofemoral region, elevates adiponectin and leptin secretion which in turn impair inflammatory processes that could be contributing to migraine risk. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of women episodic migraineurs, the HMW : LMW ADP ratio level was associated with migraine severity and predictive of acute treatment response. ADP and the HMW : LMW ratio of ADP represent potential novel biomarkers and drug targets for episodic migraine. Specifically, neurotransmittors such as serotonin, peptides such as orexin, and adipocytokines such as adiponectin and leptin have been suggested to have roles in both feeding and migraine.  Obesity can be considered as a proinflammatory state in which increased inflammatory mediators, vascular hyperreactivity, plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentrations and decreased adiponectin concentrations are observed. These alterations can cause an increase in the frequency of migraine attacks developed of central sensitization, and thereafter, chronic migraine. Specifically, neurotransmittors such as serotonin, peptides such as orexin, and adipocytokines such as adiponectin and leptin have been suggested to have roles in both feeding and migraine.  Several adipocytokines appear to play an integral role in feeding and obesity--and have also been linked to pain. Among these proteins are adiponectin and leptin. The author reviews the regulation of adipose tissue and feeding and provides an in-depth examination of adiponectin and leptin and their association with migraine.

58cd633c02b8c6095300003a	What is known about telomere length shortening and stress?	A significant relationship between more perceived stress and shorter telomere length is consistent with theoretical frameworks positing that stress induces physiological changes that result in shortened telomeres.  Psychological stress contributes to numerous diseases and may do so in part through damage to telomeres, protective non-coding segments on the ends of chromosomes. Our results support the hypothesis that depression is associated with accelerated cell aging. Future studies are required to clarify whether the association is mediated through environmental stress, and whether effective treatment can halt cell aging. Telomere length, a reliable predictor of disease pathogenesis, can be affected by genetics, chronic stress and health behaviors. Cross-sectionally, highly stressed postmenopausal women have shorter telomeres, but only if they are inactive.

5e48339fd14c9f295d00000e	What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?	A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the administration of potassium iodide (KI). Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not against other radionuclides.  Due to high volatility and environmental mobility, radioactive isotopes of iodine pose a serious risk in the acute phases of a nuclear accident. The critical organ for iodine is the thyroid. A number of studies dealing with thyroid protection from exposure to radioiodine have shown that radioiodine uptake by the thyroid can be effectively blocked by administration of stable iodine, usually in the form of potassium iodide (KI) pills.

Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. CD28 is a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response The novel role of CD28 as receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms. Our finding that CD28 is a direct receptor of superantigen toxins broadens the scope of microbial pathogen recognition mechanisms. CD28: direct and critical receptor for superantigen toxins. The need to protect from superantigen toxins led to our discovery that in addition to the well-known MHC class II and T cell receptors, the principal costimulatory receptor, CD28, and its constitutively expressed coligand, B7-2 (CD86), previously thought to have only costimulatory function, are actually critical superantigen receptors.  Structural analysis showed that when a superantigen binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell and major histocompatibility class II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, CD28 can be accommodated readily as third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in the superantigen.  Our finding that CD28 is a direct receptor of superantigen toxins broadens the scope of microbial pathogen recognition mechanisms.  The novel role of CD28 as receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms. Binding of superantigen toxins into the CD28 homodimer interface is essential for induction of cytokine genes that mediate lethal shock.Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock.  CD28 is a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through an interaction with its B7 coligands, yet we show here that to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity, superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28. Our findings identify the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens.

5549de44f35db7552600000c	By which mechanism MutT proteins act against DNA lesions in bacteria?	in addition to the well-characterized hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP at the α-β position, MutT cleaves at the β-γ phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the α-β position MutT also catalyzes the hydrolysis of 5-methyl-dCTP The common substrate structure for the functionally diverse Nudix protein superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The substrate specificity is known for less than 1% of the 29,400 known members. Most activities result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. the pathogen is exposed to reactive oxygen species, known to damage dGTP and GTP to 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, respectively. Incorporation of the damaged nucleotides in nucleic acids is detrimental to organisms. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. Here, we characterized MtuMutT1 and Rv1700 proteins of M. tuberculosis. Unlike other MutT proteins, MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP, and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GDP. Rv1700 then converts them to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. This observation suggests the presence of a two-stage mechanism of 8-oxo-dGTP/8-oxo-GTP detoxification in mycobacteria. A to C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency) Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with both cytosine and adenine. oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. The 8-oxo-GTP produced in this way and by the oxidation of GTP can be used for RNA synthesis. This misincorporation is prevented by MutT protein, which has the potential to cleave 8-oxo-GTP as well as 8-oxo-GDP to 8-oxo-GMP. By hydrolyzing the oxidized guanine nucleotides before their incorporation into nucleic acids, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing organisms to avoid their deleterious effects. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP.  A-to-C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency) Reactive oxygen species induce oxidative damage in DNA precursors, i.e. dNTPs, leading to point mutations upon incorporation. Escherichia coli mutT strains, deficient in the activity hydrolysing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), display more than a 100-fold higher spontaneous mutation frequency over the wild-type strain. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated opposite template A. Prevention and correction of oxidative DNA lesions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ensured by the DNA oxidative repair system (GO). Single inactivation of mutT, mutY and mutM involved in GO led to elevated mutation rates (MRs) the GO system (mutM, mutY and mutT) Human MTH1 and Escherichia coli MutT proteins hydrolyze 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP) to monophosphate, thus avoiding the incorporation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine into nascent DNA. Unlike other MutT proteins, MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP, and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GDP. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. By hydrolyzing the oxidized guanine nucleotides before their incorporation into nucleic acids, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing organisms to avoid their deleterious effects. MutT-related proteins, including the Escherichia coli MutT and human MutT homologue 1 (MTH1) proteins, degrade 8-oxo- 7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) to a monophosphate, thereby preventing mutations caused by the misincorporation of 8-oxoguanine into DNA. In mutator strains lacking MutT and/or MutM proteins, 8-oxoguanine of DNA increased to a concentration expected from the increased rate of mutation. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains. MutT and MutY proteins, when active, protect bacteria from mutations induced by 8-oxoG lesions in DNA. MutT-related proteins degrade 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), a mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis, in the nucleotide pool, thereby preventing DNA replication errors. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains	["MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases.

56e844c442442bac75000002	When is the protein NFL a biomarker?	Neurofilament light chain: A prognostic biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. CSF neurofilament light chain reflects corticospinal tract degeneration in ALS. Raised neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is thought to reflect axonal damage in a range of neurological disorders. Serum neurofilament light chain is a biomarker of human spinal cord injury severity and outcome. Detection of neurofilament-H in serum as a diagnostic tool to predict injury severity in patients who have suffered mild traumatic brain injury. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration is elevated in neurological disorders, including frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). We examined axonal injury in HIV-1 patients by measuring the light subunit of neurofilament protein (NFL) in CSF with a novel, sensitive method. FL appears to be a sensitive biomarker of subclinical and clinical brain injury in HIV and warrants further assessment for broader clinical use. Analysis of MBP, NFL and GFAp provides direct means to measure tissue damage and is a useful addition to our methods for evaluation of MS.  The association of prolonged CSF NFL increase in boxers with impairment of processing speed is an interesting observation, which needs to be verified in larger studies. neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in CSF of relapsing remitting (RR) patients with MS were normalized by natalizumab treatment Our results suggest that NfL is superior over NfH(SMI) (35) as therapeutic biomarker and is a promising candidate to measure neuroaxonal damage in MS treatment trials. Increased neurofilament light chain blood levels in neurodegenerative neurological diseases. Our data supports further longitudinal studies of serum NfL in neurodegenerative diseases as a potential biomarker of on-going disease progression, and as a potential surrogate to quantify effects of neuroprotective drugs in clinical trials.  We confirmed and expanded upon previous findings regarding neurofilaments as quantitative markers of neurodegeneration CSF T-tau, GFAP, and NFL are differently altered across different neurologic diseases in children Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain protein levels in subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. he marked NFL elevation in some but not all FTD cases is likely to reflect the different underlying pathologies. High levels of NFL also correlated with the presence of an AD biomarker pattern defined by Aβ42/P-tau and T-tau.  Increased CSF levels of T-tau, NFL, GFAP, and S-100B in>80% of the boxers demonstrate that both the acute and the cumulative effect of head trauma in Olympic boxing may induce CSF biomarker changes that suggest minor central nervous injuries.  eurofilament light protein (NFL), may both be released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during pathological processes in the central nervous system (CNS). We investigated GFAP and NFL levels in CSF as possible biomarkers for progression in multiple sclerosis (MS).  A CSF profile with higher levels of NFL, Abeta42, and CSF/serum albumin ratio may indicate neuropathological and vascular events in depression etiology.  At present we cannot recommend CSF NfH and NfL levels for use as a screening test in the diagnosis of dementia because of the rather small effect size. However, both neurofilament proteins may be of value for targeted investigation of some patients with FTLD, SVD and AD. Differences in CSF biomarker profiles might reflect differential involvement of neurofilaments and tau in FTD and EAD. The subgroup of FTD patients with high CSF neurofilament levels may have a different neuropathological substrate and future studies addressing this specific issue are needed. Increased levels of neurofilament light chain and tau and decreased levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol were associated with high accuracy levels in differentiating the cerebellar subtype of multiple-system atrophy from idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA).  Increased level of NFL is a general feature of MS, indicating continuous axonal damage during the entire course of the disease with the most profound damage during acute relapses.

5a7610ca83b0d9ea6600001b	What is the role of nimotuzumab in treatment of pontine glioma?	Targeted therapy protocols included radiation therapy along with treatment by erlotinib, cilengitide, or an association of nimotuzumab and vinblastine. . We found that nimotuzumab with or without radiotherapy, chemotherapy in newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), might improve the response rate or the survival time. In conclusion, nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug with acceptable toxicity, and it may have promising value in the combination treatment. Time to progression following initiation of nimotuzumab for the 4 patients with SD or better at W18 was 119, 157, 182 and 335 days, respectively. Median survival time was 3.2 months. Two patients lived 663 and 481 days from the start of nimotuzumab.CONCLUSIONS: Modest activity of nimotuzumab in DIPG, which has been shown previously, was confirmed: A small subset of DIPG patients appeared to benefit from anti-EGFR antibody treatment. Additionally, 1 patient received nimotuzumab once per week.  Findings on the role of EGFR signaling in the onset of childhood DIPG prompted the use of nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody.   The nimotuzumab/vinorelbine combination was very well tolerated, with no acute side-effects.  This strategy generated interesting results and warrants further investigation. Combining craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab therapy may slightly improve tumor control and overall survival.  Here, we describe the case of an 8-year-old girl with primary metastatic DIPG who received craniospinal radiotherapy, a local boost, and concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab treatment based on an individual therapy recommendation.  The most frequently used drugs were etoposide (14), bevacizumab (13), irinotecan (13), nimotuzumab (13), and valproic acid (13). Recent studies of nimotuzumab indicate the reason for the lack of toxicity, which is the most attractive argument for its clinical use besides modest efficacy. . Studies are also ongoing in pediatric HGG with 2 EGFR inhibitors: cetuximab and nimotuzumab.

5abcf6b9fcf4565872000027	What is caused by the ectopic expression of CTCF?	Enforced ectopic expression of CTCF inhibits cell growth in culture. Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis.  Ectopic expression of CTCF results in severe cell growth inhibition at multiple points within the cell cycle, indicating that CTCF levels must be stringently monitored. ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; Ectopic expression of CTCF in various normal and tumoral human cell lines inhibits cell division and clonogenicity, with the consequence to consider CTCF a potential tumor-suppressor factor. Depletion of the BORIS gene leads to altered transcription of a large number of genes and the differentiation of K562 cells, while the ectopic expression of this CTCF paralog leads to specific changes in transcription in MCF7 cells. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293 cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2. These findings indicate that erythroid specific activator GATA-1 acts at CTCF sites around the β-globin locus to establish tissue-specific chromatin organization. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation. To determine how these varying effects would integrate in vivo, we engineered a variety of expression systems to study effects of CTCF on cell growth. Here we show that ectopic expression of CTCF in many cell types inhibits cell clonogenicity by causing profound growth retardation without apoptosis. While MYC is the well-characterized CTCF target, the inhibitory effects of CTCF on cell growth could not be ascribed solely to repression of MYC, suggesting that additional CTS-driven genes involved in growth-regulatory circuits, such as p19ARF, are likely to contribute to CTCF-induced growth arrest. Deletion of the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral genome instability. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation.

53175f0bb166e2b80600000c	What is the role of necroptosis in cancer therapy?	Previous evidences suggest that necroptosis has significant effects in regulating various physiological processes and disease, such as ischemic brain injury, immune system disorders and cancer. Its signaling pathways have something in common with apoptosis, although the molecular mechanisms of necroptosis need to be further elucidated. Necroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, is caspase independent but RIPK and RIPK3 dependent. Moreover, it is suggested that necroptosis can be specifically inhibited by small molecular inhibitors such as necrostatin-1. Inhibition of GSK3B bypass drug resistance of p53-null colon carcinomas by enabling necroptosis in response to chemotherapy Cell death of 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-treated p53-null GSK3B-silenced colon carcinoma cells occurred via PARP1-dependent and AIF-mediated but RIP1-independent necroptosis. In vivo studies showed that drug-resistant xenograft tumor mass was significantly reduced only when 5FU was given after GSK3B inhibition. Inducing programmed cell death (PCD) is a promising method to prevent or inhibit the progression of tumor cells. Intricate cross talk among various programmed cell death pathways including cell death by apoptosis, necroptosis or autophagy plays a critical role in the regulation of PCD. This review article focuses on targeting FLIP (Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein) signaling as a bridge between various PCD processes as an effective approach for cancer management. Interconnections between apoptotic, autophagic and necrotic pathways: implications for cancer therapy development Upon introduction of molecular pathways governing autophagy and necrosis (also called necroptosis or programmed necrosis), we focus on the interconnected character of cell death signals	['Necroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death (PCD), is caspase independent but RIPK and RIPK3 dependent. The apoptotic, autophagic and necroptotic pathways of PCD were shown to be interconnected, with molecules such as FLIP acting as a bridge between them. Therefore, simultaneous activation of the three PCD pathways would make cancer therapy more effective, whereas induction of necroptosis could be an alternative, in cases where apoptosis-inducing cancer chemotherapy is not effective. For example, inhibition of GSK3B was found to bypass drug resistance of p53-null colon carcinomas by enabling necroptosis in response to 5-FU treatment.']

58bebc4c02b8c60953000015	What is the connection between furin and hepcidin?	Hepcidin is mainly produced by the liver as a propeptide and processed by furin into the mature active peptide.  Implication of the proprotein convertases in iron homeostasis: proprotein convertase 7 sheds human transferrin receptor 1 and furin activates hepcidin. Analysis of primary hepatocytes from mice lacking furin, PC5, PACE4, or PC7 revealed that hepcidin, which limits iron availability in the circulation, is specifically generated by furin and not by PC7.  Among the PC family members, only furin activates hepcidin in hepatocytes, and uniquely the full-length membrane-bound PC7 can directly shed hTfR1 by cleavage at Arg100 ↓. The human hepcidin gene contains three exons that encode a 72-aa precursor (pro-hepcidin) with a characteristic furin cleavage site immediately N-terminal to the 25-aa major hepcidin species found in plasma and urine [3] Pro-hepcidin is unable to degrade the iron exporter ferroportin unless maturated by a furin-dependent process. The iron-regulatory peptide hepcidin is synthesized in the liver as an 84-aa pre-pro-hormone maturated by proteolysis through a consensus furin cleavage site to generate the bioactive 25-aa peptide secreted in the circulation. This peptide regulates iron export from enterocytes and macrophages by binding the membrane iron exporter, ferroportin, leading to its degradation.  Our results demonstrate that pro-hepcidin lacks biological activity, unless fully maturated by a furin-dependent process to yield the bioactive 25-aa peptide. Posttranslational processing of hepcidin in human hepatocytes is mediated by the prohormone convertase furin. Hepcidin is encoded as an 84 amino acid prepropeptide containing a typical N-terminal 24 amino acid endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal sequence, and a 35 amino acid proregion (pro) with a consensus furin cleavage site immediately followed by the C-terminal 25 amino acid bioactive iron-regulatory hormone (mature peptide).  In conclusion, the hepatic prohormone convertase furin mediates the posttranslational processing of hepcidin. In conclusion, the hepatic prohormone convertase furin mediates the posttranslational processing of hepcidin. Furin in turn may control hepcidin expression.

However, the activity of the pro-peptide on ferroportin degradation has never been addressed.METHODS: To answer this question, we produced recombinant pro-hepcidin, both the wild-type form and a furin cleavage site mutant, and tested their activity on ferroportin levels in macrophagic J774 cells.

5a85a0f1faa1ab7d2e000032	What is the definition of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs)?	General regulatory factors (GRFs) as genome partitioners GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains. Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast.  Extensive role of the general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, in determining genome-wide chromatin structure in budding yeast. Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites having a wide range of affinities We found that nucleosomes and specific DNA-binding proteins, including the general regulatory factors (GRFs) Reb1p, Rap1p, and Abf1p, and Pol III transcription factors enhance the efficiency of NNS termination by physically blocking Pol II progression  In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these regions are adjacent to binding sites for general regulatory transcription factors, and the Reb1 protein is commonly bound to promoter DNA near such regions. We speculate that an important function of general regulatory factors such as Reb1p is to establish and maintain proper transcription start sites at promoters, and that when binding of such factors is compromised, resulting effects on mRNA translation may be an underappreciated aspect of gene regulation studies. Abf1 and other general regulatory factors control ribosome biogenesis gene expression in budding yeast Multiple roles of the general regulatory factor Abf1 in yeast ribosome biogenesis  This observation changes the paradigm of general regulatory factors as relatively static DNA-binding proteins constitutively bound to highly active promoters, and point to Abf1, which binds hundreds of non-RPG promoters within the yeast genome, as a possible key regulatory switch in nutrient- and stress-dependent transcriptional modulation Insulators are sequences that uncouple adjacent chromosome domains. Here we have shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs). Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a group of more than 200 co-regulated genes (Ribi genes) is involved in ribosome biogenesis. This regulon has recently been shown to rely on a small set of transcriptional regulators (mainly Abf1, but also Reb1, Tbf1 and Rap1) previously referred to as general regulatory factors (GRFs) because of their widespread binding and action at many promoters and other specialized genomic regions.

Thus GRFs, which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains.<br> Gene-regulation functions (GRF) provide a unique characteristic of a cis-regulatory module (CRM), relating the concentrations of transcription factors (input) to the promoter activities (output). Several general conclusions have been drawn: 1), long-range interactions, multilayer assembly and DNA looping may lead to complex GRFs that cannot be described by linear functions of binding site occupancies; 2), in general, GRFs cannot be described by the Boolean logic, whereas a three-state non-Boolean logic suffices for the studied examples; 3), studied CRMs of the intact phages seemed to have a similar GRF topology (the number of plateaus and peaks corresponding to different expression regimes); we hypothesize that functionally equivalent CRMs might have topologically equivalent GRFs for a larger class of genetic systems; and 4) within a given GRF class, a set of mechanistic-to-mathematical transformations has been identified, which allows shaping the GRF before carrying out a system-level analysis.<br> We found that nucleosomes and specific DNA-binding proteins, including the general regulatory factors (GRFs) Reb1p, Rap1p, and Abf1p, and Pol III transcription factors enhance the efficiency of NNS termination by physically blocking Pol II progression. Here, we will focus on the roles of gene regulatory factors (GRFs), in particular transcription factors (TFs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during human evolution. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by GRFs have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of GRFs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a group of more than 200 co-regulated genes (Ribi genes) is involved in ribosome biogenesis. This regulon has recently been shown to rely on a small set of transcriptional regulators (mainly Abf1, but also Reb1, Tbf1 and Rap1) previously referred to as general regulatory factors (GRFs) because of their widespread binding and action at many promoters and other specialized genomic regions. Intriguingly, Abf1 binding to Ribi genes is differentially modulated in response to distinct nutrition signaling pathways. Such a dynamic promoter association has the potential to orchestrate both activation and repression of Ribi genes in synergy with neighboring regulatory sites and through the functional interplay of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Deciphering the molecular basis of how modern human phenotypes have evolved is one of the most fascinating challenges in biology. Here, we will focus on the roles of gene regulatory factors (GRFs), in particular transcription factors (TFs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during human evolution. We will present examples of TFs and lncRNAs that have changed or show signs of positive selection in humans compared to chimpanzees, in modern humans compared to archaic humans, or within modern human populations. On the basis of current knowledge about the functions of these GRF genes, we speculate that they have been involved in speciation as well as in shaping phenotypes such as brain functions, skeletal morphology, and metabolic processes. the packaging of eukaryotic genomes into nuclesomes plays critical roles in chromatin organization and gene regulation studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal dna sequences such as poly a sequences as well as by binding sites for trans acting factors that can evict nucleosomes such as reb1 and the rsc3 30 complex here we use genome wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 ascomycota fungi to discover large scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure we find that poly g s act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences comparable to the known function of poly a s but that the abundance of poly g s has diverged greatly between species obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in low poly g species such as s cerevisiae we also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans acting general regulatory factor grf binding sites our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by grfs have diverged substantially across evolution corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of grfs we experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from cbf1 as a major grf in pre whole genome duplication wgd yeasts to reb1 in post wgd yeasts we further show that the mating type switch activating protein sap1 is a grf in s pombe demonstrating the general applicability of our approach our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization. rna polymerase ii pol ii transcription termination by the nrd1p nab3p sen1p nns pathway is critical for the production of stable noncoding rnas and the control of pervasive transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae to uncover determinants of nns termination we mapped the 3 ends of nns terminated transcripts genome wide we found that nucleosomes and specific dna binding proteins including the general regulatory factors grfs reb1p rap1p and abf1p and pol iii transcription factors enhance the efficiency of nns termination by physically blocking pol ii progression the same dna bound factors that promote nns termination were shown previously to define the 3 ends of okazaki fragments synthesized by pol δ during dna replication reduced binding of these factors results in defective nns termination and pol ii readthrough furthermore inactivating nns enables pol ii elongation through these roadblocks demonstrating that effective pol ii termination depends on a synergy between the nns machinery and obstacles in chromatin consistent with this finding loci exhibiting pol ii readthrough at grf binding sites are depleted for upstream nns signals overall these results underscore how rna termination signals influence the behavior of pol ii at chromatin obstacles and establish that common genomic elements define boundaries for both dna and rna synthesis machineries. ribosome biogenesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a regulon of 200 genes ribi genes coordinately regulated in response to nutrient availability and cellular growth rate two cis acting elements called pac and rrpe are known to mediate ribi gene repression in response to nutritional downshift here we show that most ribi gene promoters also contain binding sites for one or more general regulatory factors grfs most frequently abf1 and reb1 and that these factors are enriched in vivo at ribi promoters abf1 reb1 tbf1 promoter association was required for full ribi gene expression in rich medium and for its modulation in response to glucose starvation characterized by a rapid drop followed by slow recovery such a response did not entail changes in abf1 occupancy but it was paralleled by a quick increase followed by slow decrease in rpd3l histone deacetylase occupancy remarkably abf1 site disruption also abolished rpd3l complex recruitment in response to starvation extensive mutational analysis of the dbp7 promoter revealed a complex interplay of tbf1 sites pac and rrpe in the transcriptional regulation of this ribi gene our observations point to grfs as new multifaceted players in ribi gene regulation both during exponential growth and under repressive conditions. abf1 and rap1 are general regulatory factors grfs that contribute to transcriptional activation of a large number of genes as well as to replication silencing and telomere structure in yeast in spite of their widespread roles in transcription the scope of their functional targets genome wide has not been previously determined here we use microarrays to examine the contribution of these essential grfs to transcription genome wide by using ts mutants that dissociate from their binding sites at 37 degrees c we then combine this data with published chip chip studies and motif analysis to identify probable direct targets for abf1 and rap1 we also identify a substantial number of genes likely to bind rap1 or abf1 but not affected by loss of grf binding interestingly the results strongly suggest that rap1 can contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can abf1 also consistent with previous work more genes that bind abf1 are unaffected by loss of binding than those that bind rap1 finally we show for several such genes that the abf1 c terminal region which contains the putative activation domain is not needed to confer this peculiar memory effect that allows continued transcription after loss of abf1 binding.

Impact of macromolecular crowding on RNA/spermine complex coacervation and oligonucleotide compartmentalization. The addition of PEG decreased both the amount of spermine required for phase separation and the coacervation temperature (TC). Complex coacervation is an emerging liquid/liquid phase separation (LLPS) phenomenon that behaves as a membrane-less organelle in living cells. Complex coacervation is an electrostatically and entropically-driven associative liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon that can result in the formation of bulk liquid phases, or the self-assembly of hierarchical, microphase separated materials. Inspired by natural organisms, we have designed an adhesive based on complex coacervation, a liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon. Liquid-liquid phase separation leading to complex coacervation in a ternary system (oppositely charged polyion and macroion in a solvent) is discussed within the framework of a statistical thermodynamics model. This model has been successfully applied to study the coacervation phenomenon observed in aqueous Laponite (macroion)-gelatin (polyion) system where it was found that the coacervate volume fraction, δΦ{23}∼χ{231}{2} (where δΦ{23} is the volume fraction of coacervates formed during phase separation).

A review of the early development of the thermodynamics of the complex coacervation phase separation. Coacervation was defined as the phenomenon in which a colloidal dispersion separated into colloid-rich (the coacervate), and colloid-poor phases, both with the same solvent. Complex coacervation covered the situation in which a mixture of two polymeric polyions with opposite charge separated into liquid dilute and concentrated phases, in the same solvent, with both phases, at equilibrium, containing both polyions. Complex coacervation is an associative liquid/liquid phase separation resulting in the formation of two liquid phases: a polymer-rich coacervate phase and a dilute continuous solvent phase. Complex coacervation is an associative, liquid-liquid phase separation that can occur in solutions of oppositely-charged macromolecular species, such as proteins, polymers, and colloids. We address complex coacervation, the liquid-liquid phase separation of a solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains into a polyelectrolyte rich complex coacervate phase and a dilute aqueous phase, based on the general premise of spontaneous formation of polycation-polyanion complexes even in the homogeneous phase.

The ability of high-risk HPV E6 and E7 protein to promote the degradation of p53 and pRb, respectively, has been suggested as a mechanism by which HPV oncogenes induce cellular transformation. E6 and E7 abrogate cell cycle checkpoints and induce genomic instability that leads to malignant conversion The results showed that tumorigenicity and decreased serum requirement were associated with the ability of E6 to bind to p53, although the subsequent degradation of p53 was not required for these functions The E7 mutants chosen had either an in-frame deletion in the conserved region 2 (CR2) domain, which is required for binding of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and pRb-like proteins, or an in-frame deletion in the E7 CR1 domain. The recognition of a causal relationship between human papillomaviruses and cancer almost 30 years ago led to a rapid expansion of knowledge in the field, resulting in the description of the main mediators of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, the viral proteins E6 and E7. These oncoproteins show a remarkable pleiotropism in binding host-cell proteins, with the tumour suppressor genes p53 and pRb as their major targets. First, we found that human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncogenes, which block the function of the p53 and Rb tumor suppressors, respectively, and SV40 small t antigen were required to allow mutant K-Ras(12D) growth transformation In recent years, it has become clear that in addition to E6-induced degradation of p53 tumor suppressor protein, other targets of E6 are required for mammary epithelial cells immortalization. a general requirement for oncoproteins such as human papillomavirus E6 and E7 has suggested that the p53 and Rb pathways are targeted. Transformation by the human papillomavirus (HPV) early gene products, E6 and E7, involves their interaction with cellular proteins p53 and Rb. The results from this study support the theory that p53 protein binds HPV-16/18 E6 protein in the cell cytoplasm, thus preventing p53 from exerting its tumor-suppressor function in the nucleus. Hence, inactivation of wild-type p53 by p53-E6 complex formation in cervical cancer may be a critical step in malignant transformation. the E7-RbAB interaction involves multiple motifs within the N-terminal domain of E7 and at least two conserved interaction surfaces in RbAB. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb The E7 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 contains an element that binds to pRB and appears to be functionally homologous to the E1A sequences Several of the biological activities of HPV16 E7 are mediated by inactivation of the members of the pocket protein family, pRb, p107 and p130.

570a8dcfcf1c325851000027	What are the functions of the ESCRT machinery?	The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) collectively comprise a machinery that was first known for its function in the degradation of transmembrane proteins in the endocytic pathway of eukaryotic cells. Since their discovery, however, ESCRTs have been recognized as playing important roles at the plasma membrane, which appears to be the original site of function for the ESCRT machinery. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) are involved in the formation of multivesicular bodies and sorting of targeted proteins to the yeast vacuole. Disassembly of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery from biological membranes is a critical final step in cellular processes that require the ESCRT function. Evidence has accumulated revealing that efficient autophagic degradation requires functional endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. HIV-1 virions assemble at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and recruit the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery to enable particle release.  We found that endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), involved previously in membrane budding and fission, plays a critical role in plasma membrane repair. The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery is known to sort ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into vesicles that bud into the lumen of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) are needed for three distinct cellular functions in higher eukaryotes: (i) Multivesicular body formation for the degradation of transmembrane proteins in lysosomes, (ii) midbody abscission during cytokinesis and (iii) retroviral budding.  Recently it was shown that both recycling endosome and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components are required for cytokinesis, in which they are believed to act in a sequential manner to bring about secondary ingression and abscission, respectively	['The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) are needed for three distinct cellular functions in higher eukaryotes: (i) Multivesicular body formation for the degradation of transmembrane proteins in lysosomes, (ii) midbody abscission during cytokinesis and (iii) retroviral budding.']
56ecffd62ac5ed1459000003	What is oprozomib?	Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 inhibit cell survival and tumor growth of head and neck cancer and their activities are enhanced by suppression of Mcl-1 or autophagy. ONX 0912 (oprozomib) is an orally bioavailable derivative.  Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 potently induced apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines via upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bik. Upregulation of Mcl-1 by these agents served to dampen their efficacies. Carfilzomib and ONX 0912 also induced autophagy, mediated, in part, by activation of the UPR pathway involving upregulation of ATF4 transcription factor. Autophagy induction served a prosurvival role. Oral administration of ONX 0912 inhibited the growth of HNSCC xenograft tumors in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that carfilzomib and ONX 0912 are potently active against HNSCC cells, and the activities of these agents can be enhanced via suppression of Mcl-1 or inhibition of autophagy. Oral ONX 0912 exhibits in vivo activity against HNSCC tumors and may represent a useful therapeutic agent for this malignancy. The next generation proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and oprozomib activate prosurvival autophagy via induction of the unfolded protein response and ATF4. We recently reported the impact and mechanisms of carfilzomib and oprozomib, second-in-class proteasome inhibitors with higher specificities and reduced toxicities, against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Carfilzomib and oprozomib potently inhibit HNSCC cell survival and the growth of HNSCC tumors. Both compounds promote upregulation of proapoptotic BIK and antiapoptotic MCL1, which serves to mediate and attenuate, respectively, the killing activities of these proteasome inhibitors. Both compounds also induce complete autophagic flux that is partially dependent on activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and upregulation of ATF4. Carfilzomib- and oprozomib-induced autophagy acts to promote HNSCC cell survival. Our study indicates that the therapeutic benefit of these promising proteasome inhibitors may be improved by inhibiting MCL1 expression or autophagy. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable analog oprozomib, effectively decreased MM cell viability following continual or transient treatment mimicking in vivo pharmacokinetics.

Accordingly, carfilzomib and oprozomib increased trabecular bone volume, decreased bone resorption and enhanced bone formation in non-tumor bearing mice. Finally, in mouse models of disseminated MM, the epoxyketone-based PIs decreased murine 5TGM1 and human RPMI-8226 tumor burden and prevented bone loss. These data demonstrate that, in addition to anti-myeloma properties, carfilzomib and oprozomib effectively shift the bone microenvironment from a catabolic to an anabolic state and, similar to bortezomib, may decrease skeletal complications of MM. Finally, we found that DC incubation with the drug(s) enhanced IκB expression and that oprozomib inhibited NF-κB expression. We concluded that based on its activity and oral bioavailability, oprozomib merits further investigation in an animal GvHD prevention model.

56d12d643975bb303a000014	What is a disordered protein?	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are ubiquitously involved in cellular processes and often implicated in human pathological conditions. The critical biological roles of these proteins, despite not adopting a well-defined fold, encouraged structural biologists to revisit their views on the protein structure-function paradigm. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) frequently function in protein interaction networks that regulate crucial cellular signaling pathways. Many IDPs undergo transitions from disordered conformational ensembles to folded structures upon binding to their cellular targets. The intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) stathmin plays an important regulatory role in cytoskeletal maintenance through its helical binding to tubulin and microtubules. However, it lacks a stable fold in the absence of its binding partner.  Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable tertiary and/or secondary structures under physiological conditions in vitro. Intrinsically disordered proteins undergo significant conformational transitions to well folded forms only on binding to partner. DisCons is an openly accessible sequence analysis tool that identifies and highlights structurally disordered segments of proteins where the conformational flexibility is conserved across homologs, and therefore potentially functional.

Our results indicate that this simplified one-shot proteomics approach with long monolithic columns is advantageous for rapid, deep, sensitive, and reproducible proteome analysis. Rapid and deep profiling of human induced pluripotent stem cell proteome by one-shot NanoLC-MS/MS analysis with meter-scale monolithic silica columns. Here, we describe an in-house built ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, with little complexity in design and high separation power combined with convenience in operation With the longest gradient we identified over 4500 protein groups and more than 26,000 unique peptides from 1 μg of a human cancer cell lysate in a single run using an Orbitrap Velos - a level of performance often seen solely using multidimensional separation strategies Our data demonstrate that the combination of UHPLC with high resolution mass spectrometry at increased sequencing speeds enables extensive proteome analysis in single runs. The experimental results showed that the numbers of identified peptides and proteins were maximized and reached a plateau with a gradient time of several tens of hours, which indicated that our model to optimize one dimensional HPLC conditions with a long column could be verified and useful. In this study, we combined well-approved techniques, namely elevated chromatographic temperatures, long RP columns and the multidimensional protein identification technology MudPIT to achieve high proteome coverage. Also, a high identification rate for the challenging integral membrane proteins was achieved. High-efficiency liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry separations with 50 mm, 250 mm, and 1 m long polymer-based monolithic capillary columns for the characterization of complex proteolytic digests. For the analysis of a proteolytic digest of Escherichia coli proteins a monolithic capillary column of 1m in length was used, yielding a peak capacity of 1038 when applying a 600 min gradient. . It was found that very high resolutions are attainable at long gradient times with long columns. The resolution continuously became higher as the gradient time and the column length became longer except in some special cases. , such separations should be advantageous when very high resolutions are required like in proteomics research.

58d90b968acda3452900000e	What is the function of the protein tafazzin?	Tafazzin is a transacylase that transfers acyl chains with unsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids to monolysocardiolipin to generate cardiolipin with unsaturated fatty acids. Tafazzin (EC 2.3.1.23) is a Phospholipid Transacylase involved in Cardiolipin remodeling on mitochondrial membrane and coded by TAZ gene (Cytogenetic Location: Xq28) in human. Tafazzin is a transacylase that affects cardiolipin fatty acid composition and mitochondrial function.  Tafazzin is a mitochondrial phospholipid transacylase, and its mutations cause Barth syndrome (BTHS).  Tafazzin (TAZ) is a phospholipid transacylase that catalyzes the remodeling of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid required for oxidative phosphorylation.  Tafazzin expression induced a new enzymatic function in Sf9 cell mitochondria, namely 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:monolysocardiolipin linoleoyltransferase. Among the human isoforms, only full-length tafazzin (FL) and tafazzin lacking exon 5 (Delta5) had transacylase activity, and only these two isoforms were able to restore a normal cardiolipin pattern, normal respiratory activity of mitochondria, and male fertility in tafazzin-deficient flies. Tafazzin is a mitochondrial transacylase required for cardiolipin remodeling. Tafazzin is a putative enzyme that is involved in cardiolipin metabolism, it may carry mutations responsible for Barth syndrome. Tafazzin is an enzyme that remodels saturated fatty acyl chains within CL to unsaturated fatty acyl chains, loss of function mutations in the TAZ gene encoding tafazzin are causal for the inherited cardiomyopathy Barth syndrome The tafazzin gene encodes a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase involved in cardiolipin metabolism, but it is not known why it forms multiple transcripts as a result of alternative splicing. Furthermore, the data show that the expression of human tafazzin in flies creates cardiolipin with a Drosophila pattern, suggesting that the characteristic fatty acid profile of cardiolipin is not determined by the substrate specificity of tafazzin. Tafazzin is a transacylase that affects cardiolipin fatty acid composition and mitochondrial function.

54f4914bd0d681a040000001	What is the association between Generalized anxiety disorder and mortality risk?	RESULTS: MDD and GAD were positively and significantly associated with all-cause and CVD mortality. The relationships between MDD and GAD and CVD mortality were no longer significant after adjustment for sociodemograhics, health status at entry, health behaviors, and other risk markers.  In analyses comparing comorbidity and GAD and MDD alone, with neither diagnosis, comorbidity proved to be the strongest predictor of both all-cause and CVD mortality. CONCLUSION: GAD and MDD predict all-cause mortality in a veteran population after adjusting for a range of covariates. However, those with both GAD and MDD were at greatest risk of subsequent death, and it would seem that these disorders may interact synergistically to affect mortality.  Anxiety disorders are prevalent and associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, particularly when present with additional psychiatric disorders.  ICD-10 GAD was related to an increased mortality rate. Neither generalized anxiety nor mixed anxiety-depression are associated with excess mortality. Generalized anxiety disorder may even predict less mortality in depressive elderly people.  Anxiety disorders, especially generalized anxiety disorder and phobias, are highly prevalent in older people. Anxiety symptoms and disorders are associated with increased mortality and disability in older people. Anxiety disorders are prevalent and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Some chronic anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), may be characterized by an underlying high level of anxiety on which exacerbations of symptoms are superimposed. Neither generalized anxiety nor mixed anxiety-depression are associated with excess mortality. Generalized anxiety disorder may even predict less mortality in depressive elderly people. In women, mortality risk was increased for anxiety disorder and GAD in multivariate Cox models (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.53, 95% CI 1.02-2.27 and HR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.08-3.86 respectively), whereas for phobia it was nearly significant (HR = 1.52, 95% CI 0.94-2.47) Generalized anxiety disorder may even predict less mortality in depressive elderly people In generalized anxiety disorder and mixed anxiety-depression no significant excess mortality was found The relation between generalized anxiety disorder and its possibly protective effect on mortality has to be further explored. Neither generalized anxiety nor mixed anxiety-depression are associated with excess mortality However, those with both GAD and MDD were at greatest risk of subsequent death, and it would seem that these disorders may interact synergistically to affect mortality	['Numerous studies have demonstrated that Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with increased mortality risk in different populations, including veterans and non demented elderly individuals.

6032722f1cb411341a00013d	Describe a cytokine release syndrome.	The major factor responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome is the so-called "cytokine storm," which is an aberrant response from the host immune system that induces an exaggerated release of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. I A severe immune response in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a potentially lethal unconstrained inflammatory cytokine storm, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  Immune cells secrete small protein molecules that aim for cell-cell communications. These small molecules are called cytokines. Targeting cancer cells with administration of bispecific antibodies and natural extracts results in elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-6, which lead to cell toxicity. Sustained release of cytokines due to immunotherapy or hormonal issues causes various diseases. Novel T cell-engaging therapies and monoclonal antibodies cause cytokine release syndrome.  hile immunologic complications such as macrophage activation syndrome also known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, resulting in cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may also occur in some patients. Available evidence indicate that the so called "cytokine storm" an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation which, in turn, sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major responsible for the occurrence of ARDS.  ts: A 14-year-old boy with refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia given chimeric antigen receptor cells developed severe cytokine release syndrome 7 days after the drug product infusion with progressive respiratory failure. He wa heless, CAR-T cell treatment is associated with toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome, which can range in severity from mild flu-like symptoms to life-threatening vasodilatory shock, and a neurological syndrome termed ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which can also range in severity from a temporary cognitive deficit lasting only a few hours to lethal cerebral edema. In this revi Acute cytokine release syndromes are associated with some therapeutic antibodies in man, leading to a spectrum of clinical signs from nausea, chills and fever to more serious dose limiting hypotension and tachycardia. However, some patients may experience severe, life-threatening reactions that result from massive release of cytokines. When cytokines are released into the circulation, systemic symptoms such as fever, nausea, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, asthenia, headache, rash, scratchy throat, and dyspnea can result. Cytokine release syndrome is a systemic inflammatory condition that may occur after treatment with some types of immunotherapy.

This pilot study examined gene expression signatures in pathological gingival tissues of subjects with chronic or aggressive periodontitis, and explored whether new subclasses of periodontitis can be identified based on gene expression profiles. A total of 14 patients, seven with chronic and seven with aggressive periodontitis, were examined with respect to clinical periodontal status, composition of subgingival bacterial plaque assessed by checkerboard hybridizations, and levels of serum IgG antibodies to periodontal bacteria assayed by checkerboard immunoblotting. In addition, at least two pathological pockets/patient were biopsied, processed for RNA extraction, amplification and labeling, and used to study gene expression using Affymetrix U-133 A arrays. Based on a total of 35 microarrays, no significantly different gene expression profiles appeared to emerge between chronic and aggressive periodontitis. However, a de novo grouping of the 14 subjects into two fairly robust clusters was possible based on similarities in gene expression. These two groups had similar clinical periodontal status and subgingival bacterial profiles, but differed significantly with respect to serum IgG levels against the important periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Campylobacter rectus. These early data point to the usefulness of gene expression profiling techniques in the identification of subclasses of periodontitis with common pathobiology Gene ontology analysis identified 61 differentially expressed groups (adjusted P <0.05), including apoptosis, antimicrobial humoral response, antigen presentation, regulation of metabolic processes, signal transduction, and angiogenesis	['Aggressive periodontitis does not differ from chronic periodontitis from a microbial profile point of view but there are distinctive immunological signatures, including a higher expression in IgG against most periodontal pathogens and a more intense regulatory mechanism of metabolic processes.']

54fc27a896abe38008000002	Which biological process in known as Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Degradation (ERAD)?	Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) removes improperly-folded proteins from the ER membrane into the cytosol where they undergo proteasomal degradation.  In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species. An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation. During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD. From the many cellular processes, Cdc48 is involved in, its function in endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD) is understood best. This quality control process for proteins of the secretory pathway scans protein folding and discovers misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the organelle, destined for folding of these proteins and their further delivery to their site of action. Misfolded lumenal and membrane proteins of the ER are detected by chaperones and lectins and retro-translocated out of the ER for degradation.  After polyubiquitylation of the protein substrate, Cdc48 together with its dimeric co-factor complex Ufd1-Npl4 pulls the misfolded protein out and away from the ER membrane and delivers it to down-stream components for degradation by a cytosolic proteinase machine, the proteasome. Recognition and elimination of misfolded proteins are essential cellular processes. More than thirty percent of the cellular proteins are proteins of the secretory pathway. They fold in the lumen or membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum from where they are sorted to their site of action. The folding process, as well as any refolding after cell stress, depends on chaperone activity. In case proteins are unable to acquire their native conformation, chaperones with different substrate specificity and activity guide them to elimination. For most misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum this requires retro-translocation to the cytosol and polyubiquitylation of the misfolded protein by an endoplasmic reticulum associated machinery. Thereafter ubiquitylated proteins are guided to the proteasome for degradation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway eliminates aberrant proteins from the ER. Terminally misfolded or unassembled proteins are degraded by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a process known as ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation). Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is a protein quality control mechanism that minimizes the detrimental effects of protein misfolding in the secretory pathway. Molecular chaperones and ER lumenal lectins are essential components of this process because they maintain the solubility of unfolded proteins and can target ERAD substrates to the cytoplasmic proteasome. Other factors are likely required to aid in the selection of ERAD substrates, and distinct proteinaceous machineries are required for substrate retrotranslocation/dislocation from the ER and proteasome targeting. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control processes recognize and remove aberrant proteins from the secretory pathway. Several variants of the plasma protein fibrinogen are recognized as aberrant and degraded by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), thus leading to hypofibrinogenemia. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the eukaryotic organelle where most secretory proteins are folded for subsequent delivery to their site of action. Proper folding of newly synthesized proteins is monitored by a stringent ER quality control system. This system recognizes misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevents them from reaching their final destination. Instead, they are extracted from the ER, polyubiquitinated and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, elicits an adaptive response, the unfolded protein response (UPR). One component of the UPR, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, has an important function in the survival of ER stressed cells. Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26 S proteasomes. This process, termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), has also been implicated in the generation of some important human disorders, for example, cystic fibrosis. To become accessible to the proteasome, ERAD substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the ER into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation. Surprisingly, protein dislocation from the ER seems to require at least some components that also mediate import into this compartment. Moreover, polyubiquitination of ERAD substrates at the ER membrane as well as the cytoplasmic Cdc48p/Npl4p/Ufd1p complex were shown to contribute to this export reaction. Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26S proteasomes. This process is known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. In order to become accessible to the proteasome of this system substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation. This export step seems to be accompanied by polyubiquitination of such molecules. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) disposes of aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway. Protein substrates of ERAD are dislocated via the Sec61p translocon from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Membrane and secretory proteins fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and misfolded proteins may be retained and targeted for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). The endoplasmic reticulum contains a protein quality control system that discovers malfolded or unassembled secretory proteins and subjects them to degradation in the cytosol. This requires retrograde transport of the respective proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum back to the cytosol via the Sec61 translocon. In addition, a fully competent ubiquitination machinery and the 26 S proteasome are necessary for retrotranslocation and degradation. Ubiquitination of mutated and malfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent mainly on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p. In addition, several new membrane components of the endoplasmic reticulum are required for degradation. The quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells ensures that newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold into the correct conformation or unassembled orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins are rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation. This entails the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol followed by their destruction by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Until recently, the degradation of aberrant and unassembled proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was thought to involve unidentified ER-localized proteases. We now show that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of two mutant proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen is inhibited in a proteasome-defective yeast strain and when cytosol from this mutant is used in an in vitro assay. In addition, ERAD is limited in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and lactacystin. We conclude that lumenal ERAD substrates are exported from the yeast ER to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome complex. Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation. Early secretory and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized proteins that are terminally misfolded or misassembled are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Proteins that fail to correctly fold or assemble into oligomeric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Proteins that cannot fold properly will be directed to a process known as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an essential quality control process whereby misfolded proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol. Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD. Proteins that fail to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cannot find a pattern for assembly are often disposed of by a process named ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves transport of the substrate protein across the ER membrane (dislocation) followed by rapid proteasome-mediated proteolysis.

530a3f8a970c65fa6b000006	Define marine metaproteomics	Metaproteomics is a new field within the 'omics' science which investigates protein expression from a complex biological system and provides direct evidence of physiological and metabolic activities. Metaproteomic studies of whole microbial communities from environmental samples (e.g., soil, sediments, freshwater, seawater, etc.) have rapidly increased in recent years due to many technological advances in mass spectrometry (MS).  Metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics are approaches based on different techniques and have recently emerged as promising techniques to describe microbial activities within a given environment at the molecular level.  Culture-independent techniques such as LC-MS/MS-based metaproteomic analyses are being increasingly utilized for the study of microbial composition and function in complex environmental samples. Metaproteomic analysis and protein-stable isotope probing revealed Burkholderiales, Actinomycetales, and Rhizobiales as the most active microorganisms in the groundwater communities. Advances in tandem mass spectrometry (tandem MS) and sequencing have enabled the field of community proteomics, which seeks to identify expressed proteins, their sequence variability, and the physiological responses of organisms to variable environmental conditions Marine community proteomic studies have verified the importance of nutrient transport, energy generation, and carbon fixation functions in bacteria and archaea and revealed spatial and temporal shifts in the expressed functions of communities.  Metagenomics is the study of microbial organisms using sequencing applied directly to environmental samples. Similarly, in metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, the RNA and protein sequences of such samples are studied. The analysis of these kinds of data often starts by asking the questions of "who is out there?", "what are they doing?", and "how do they compare?".  the study of the proteins collectively expressed by all the microorganisms present within an ecosystem (metaproteomics) is not only crucial but can also provide insights into microbial functionality. Metaproteomics has been employed in very diverse environments, and this review discusses the recent advances achieved in the context of human biology, soil, marine and freshwater environments as well as natural and bioengineered systems. To assess the functional dynamics of microbial communities, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics have been developed. The combination of DNA-based, mRNA-based, and protein-based analyses of microbial communities present in different environments is a way to elucidate the compositions, functions, and interactions of microbial communities and to link these to environmental processes. Metaproteomics is one of a suite of new approaches providing insights into the activities of microorganisms in natural environments.  We used comparative membrane metaproteomics to identify functional responses of communities to different nutrient concentrations on an oceanic scale. This study describes the application of proteomic approaches (metaproteomics) to observe expressed protein profiles of natural microbial communities (metaproteomes).  metaproteomics analysis of fecal samples to determine microbial gut composition and protein expression.

Effective Targeting of Estrogen Receptor-Negative Breast Cancers with the Protein Kinase D Inhibitor CRT0066101. In conclusion, CRT0066101 is a potent and specific PKD family inhibitor. Our PKD inhibitor discovery program identified CRT0066101 as a specific inhibitor of all PKD isoforms. This identifies ER(-) breast cancers as ideal for treatment with the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101. Recently developed small molecule PKD inhibitors, CID755673 and CRT0066101, provide potentially important pharmacological approaches to further investigate the effect of PKD in pancreatitis therapy.

55032785e9bde69634000031	What is the association between NT-proBNP and cognitive function?	RESULTS: Measures of cognitive decline were significantly associated with stroke, NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, but not with nonstroke vascular events.  SCI was present at baseline more often in NYHA IV patients compared with NYHA II [odds ratio 2.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-7.51, P = 0.025], but it was not related to NT-proBNP levels.  Comparing extreme quintiles of NT-proBNP, subjects in the highest quintile were more likely to have reduced cognitive ability (within the lowest tertile of 'g') and 'possible' depression (HADS depression ≥8) (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70; p = 0.005 and OR 2.18; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.71; p = 0.004, respectively). Associations persisted when pre-morbid ability was adjusted for, but as expected were no longer statistically significant following the adjustment for diabetes-related and vascular co-variates (β -0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03, p>0.05 for 'g'; β 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, p>0.05 for depression scores). CONCLUSION: Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression. The prospective phases of the ET2DS will help determine whether or not NT-proBNP can be considered a risk marker for subsequent cognitive impairment and incident depression and whether it provides additional information over and above traditional risk factors for these conditions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with vascular disease and elevated serum NT-proBNP level had a lower cognition level, shorter survival time, lower renal function and a higher percentage of pathological brain imaging than patients with vascular disease and normal NT-proBNP level.  BACKGROUND: Natriuretic peptides have prognostic value across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases and may predict cognitive dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease, even in the absence of previous stroke.  In unadjusted analyses, all 3 cognitive function test scores were significantly associated with NT-proBNP levels (P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, education, hypertension, body mass index, exercise, alcohol use, smoking, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine clearance, and previous cardiovascular disease, elevated NT-proBNP levels remained independently associated with poor cognitive performance on MMSE (odds ratio [OR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.6; P=.02) and Trails B (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P=.01), but not Category Fluency (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.2; P=.19).   CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP levels were strongly and independently associated with poor cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. However, NT-proBNP level did not predict cognition as assessed by MMSE score.  However, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly enhanced both in MCI and AD patients (1 In a second analysis of a sample of 110 subjects including younger healthy controls, we confirmed that NT-proBNP has the potential to be a stable candidate protein for both diagnosis and AD disease progression Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression In unadjusted analyses, all 3 cognitive function test scores were significantly associated with NT-proBNP levels (P<.001) NT-proBNP levels were strongly and independently associated with poor cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults.	['Greater NT-proBNP serum concentration is associated with poorer cognitive function and cognitive decline.

However, other authors did not find an association between NT-proBNP and severe cognitive impairment (SCI).']
58b576b622d3005309000008	What is the role of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (CSN)?	The family of cullin-RING E3 Ligases (CRLs) and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) form dynamic complexes that mediate ubiquitylation of 20% of the proteome, yet regulation of their assembly/disassembly remains poorly understood.  The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN) is a protein complex involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system and a common host target of diverse pathogens in Arabidopsis.  The COP9 (Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN), a large multiprotein complex that resembles the 19S lid of the 26S proteasome, plays a central role in the regulation of the E3-cullin RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). The mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), a protein complex involved in embryonic development, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response. Its role in tumor development, however, remains unclear. COP9 plays a role in plant innate immunity.  The constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (COP9 or CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex found in plants and animals. Because of the homology between the COP9 signalosome and the 19S lid complex of the proteosome, COP9 has been postulated to play a role in regulating the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins.  Therefore, it is conceivable that COP9 plays a significant role in cancer, regulating processes relevant to carcinogenesis and cancer progression (e.g., cell cycle control, signal transduction and apoptosis).  The constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) plays key roles in many biological processes, such as repression of photomorphogenesis in plants and protein subcellular localization, DNA-damage response, and NF-κB activation in mammals. The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis mutant 9) signalosome (CSN) may regulate the UPS, but this has not been tested in a critical vertebrate organ. The mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), a protein complex involved in embryonic development, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response. Here we show that the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HeLa and HL-60 cells is directed by the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (CSN). The family of cullin-RING E3 Ligases (CRLs) and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) form dynamic complexes that mediate ubiquitylation of 20% of the proteome, yet regulation of their assembly/disassembly remains poorly understood. CSN6 is one subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), which is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex found in plants and animals and originally described as a repressor of light-dependent growth and transcription in Arabidopsis. CSN6, a critical subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), has received attention as a regulator of the degradation of cancer-related proteins such as p53, c-myc and c-Jun, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting its importance in cancerogenesis. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a complex of eight proteins first identified as a repressor of plant photomorphogenesis. COP10 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (UEV), which is thought to act together with COP1, DET1, and the COP9 signalosome (CSN) in Arabidopsis to repress photomorphogenesis. The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis mutant 9) signalosome (CSN) may regulate the UPS, but this has not been tested in a critical vertebrate organ.

The mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), a protein complex involved in embryonic development, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response.  Recent studies indicate that Int6 is a multifaceted protein involved in the regulation of protein translation and degradation through binding with three complexes: the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, the proteasome regulatory lid, and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome.  The COP9 Signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that was originally identified in Arabidopsis thaliana as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and subsequently shown to be a general eukaryotic regulator of developmental signaling.  In this report we demonstrate a JNK-independent activation of c-Jun in vivo directed by the constitutive photomorphogenesis (COP9) signalosome.  The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that was initially identified in plants as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. This study suggests that AtItpk-1 may function as a protein kinase that is involved in photomorphogenesis possibly via interaction with COP9 signalosome under red light. The Arabidopsis inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6 kinase, AtItpk-1, is involved in plant photomorphogenesis under red light conditions, possibly via interaction with COP9 signalosome.

5ab9050bfcf4565872000019	What is break induced replication?	Break-induced replication (BIR) is an important pathway specializing in repair of one-ended double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). This type of DSB break typically arises at collapsed replication forks or at eroded telomeres. BIR initiates by invasion of a broken DNA end into a homologous template followed by initiation of DNA synthesis that can proceed for hundreds of kilobases. This synthesis is drastically different from S-phase replication in that instead of a replication fork, BIR proceeds via a migrating bubble and is associated with conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. This unusual mode of DNA replication is responsible for frequent genetic instabilities associated with BIR, including hyper-mutagenesis, which can lead to the formation of mutation clusters, extensive loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal translocations, copy-number variations and complex genomic rearrangements. In addition to budding yeast experimental systems that were initially employed to investigate eukaryotic BIR, recent studies in different organisms including humans, have provided multiple examples of BIR initiated within different cellular contexts, including collapsed replication fork and telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase.

The estimated total cost in treating stress urinary incontinence was 122 billion KRW in 2006 and 59 billion KRW in 2007. OAB may severely impair quality of life, and its overall economic costs to society are substantial The estimated total economic cost of OAB was 12.02 billion dollars in 2000, with 9.17 and 2.85 billion dollars incurred in the community and institutions, respectively. Community female and male OAB costs totaled 7.37 and 1.79 billion dollars, respectively. The estimated total cost was sensitive to the estimated prevalence of OAB; therefore, we calculated the average cost per community-dwelling person with OAB, which was 267 dollars per year. The conservative estimates of the total cost of OAB were comparable to those of osteoporosis and gynecologic and breast cancer. An estimated 1835628 community-dwelling women over the age of 18 years had urinary incontinence in 1998. The total annual cost of this urinary incontinence is estimated at $710.44 million, or $387 per incontinent woman, comprising $338.47 million in treatment costs and $371.97 million in personal costs. An estimated 60% of women with incontinence in 1998 were aged 40 years or over. Assuming the prevalence of incontinence remains constant and, allowing for inflation, we project that the total annual cost in 20 years' time will be $1267.85 million, 93% ($1.18 billion) of which will constitute costs associated with women aged over 40 years.  Overactive bladder (OAB) is a highly prevalent condition among older patients, and its presence is associated with the use of substantial healthcare resources and economic costs. Caring for incontinent patients in the long-term care setting was shown to result in substantial additional costs, For individuals 65 years of age and older these costs are substantial, increasing from $8.2 billion (1984 dollars) to $16.4 billion (1993 dollars).  The 1995 societal cost of incontinence for individuals aged 65 years and older was $26.3 billion, or $3565 per individual with urinary incontinence.

515dbb3b298dcd4e51000018	How histone deacetylation causes transcriptional gene silencing?	Lysine acetylation of histones is one of the major epigenetic regulators of chromatin conformation and gene expression. The dynamic nature of histone acetylation is determined by the counterbalancing activity of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. Acetylation of histones is generally associated with open and transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the activity of HDACs leads to histone deacetylation, condensation of chromatin, and inhibition of transcription. Abnormal activity of HDACs has been implicated in tumorigenesis and therefore considerable effort has been put into the development of HDAC inhibitors as a means of modifying histone acetylation status and reexpressing aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes. Histone acetylation and deacetylation play essential roles in eukaryotic gene regulation. Reversible modifications of core histones are catalyzed by two intrinsic enzymes, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HD). In general, histone deacetylation is related to transcriptional gene silencing, whereas acetylation correlates with gene activation. The reversible nature of deregulated chromatin structure by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation inhibitors, leading to re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, makes chromatin-remodeling pathways as promising therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), recovered the expression and function of NEO1 in the silenced lines, suggesting that histone deacetylation is essential for the direct suppression of target genes by DNAi. We had previously shown that in anergic CD4(+) T cells, Ikaros participates in the transcriptional repression of the Il2 gene by recruiting histone deacetylases that cause core histone deacetylation at the Il2 promoter. Here we show that deacetylation at the Il2 promoter is the initial step in a process that leads to the stable silencing of the Il2 gene transcription in anergic T cells. We demonstrate that HP1 forms distinct DNA methylation and histone deacetylation complexes that work in parallel to assemble silent chromatin in N. crassa. These results indicated that histone deacetylation is a silencing mechanism for GATA4 expression in AFP-producing gastric cancer cells. We found that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) increases the expression levels of mature miRNAs despite repressing the transcription of host genes. Promoter methylation and histone deacetylation were studied as possible mechanisms for klotho silencing. Taken together, these data indicate loss of klotho expression as an early event in breast cancer development, and suggest a role for DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in klotho silencing. DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and nonepigenetic phenomenon DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and nonepigenetic phenomenon. Because DNA hypermethylation-based silencing may couple with and depend on histone deacetylation, our study suggests that endogenous HDAC inhibition by maspin may prevent pathologic gene silencing in prostate tumor progression. Epigenetic regulation of the IL-13-induced human eotaxin-3 gene by CREB-binding protein-mediated histone 3 acetylation. Heterochromatin impacts various nuclear processes by providing a recruiting platform for diverse chromosomal proteins. In fission yeast, HP1 proteins Chp2 and Swi6, which bind to methylated histone H3 lysine 9, associate with SHREC (Snf2/HDAC repressor complex) and Clr6 histone deacetylases (HDACs) involved in heterochromatic silencing. We established that the silencing of these genes in UVB-exposed epidermis and UVB-induced skin tumors is associated with a network of epigenetic modifications, including hypoacetylation of histone H3 and H4 and increased histone deacetylation, as well as recruitment of methyl-binding proteins, including MeCP2 and MBD1, to the methylated CpGs. Histone deacetylation directs DNA methylation in survivin gene silencing. Next, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in survivin silencing after blockade of histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA). The results showed that histone deacetylation blocked by TSA reversed the increasing effect of histone deacetylation on the expression of survivin mRNA. Aberrant hypermethylation at CpG sites within the CDKN2A gene is associated with silencing and has been proposed as a target for reactivation using both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation inhibitors. Mechanisms of HDA6-mediated rRNA gene silencing: suppression of intergenic Pol II transcription and differential effects on maintenance versus siRNA-directed cytosine methylation. The Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA6 is required to silence transgenes, transposons, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes subjected to nucleolar dominance in genetic hybrids. Distinct and temporal roles of nucleosomal remodeling and histone deacetylation in the repression of the hTERT gene. Surprisingly, inhibition of histone deacetylation at the hTERT promoter did not prevent hTERT repression or nucleosomal deposition, indicating that nucleosomal deposition at the core promoter, but not histone deacetylation, was the cause of transcriptional repression. Our data also suggested that succeeding nucleosomal remodeling and histone deacetylation worked in parallel to establish the stable repressive status of hTERT gene in human somatic cells. Reconstitution of heterochromatin-dependent transcriptional gene silencing. Silencing requires all three Sir proteins, even with fully deacetylated chromatin, and involves the specific association of Sir3 with deacetylated H4K16. These results define a minimal set of components that mediate heterochromatic gene silencing and demonstrate distinct contributions for histone deacetylation and nucleosome binding in the silencing mechanism. Silencing requires all three Sir proteins, even with fully deacetylated chromatin, and involves the specific association of Sir3 with deacetylated H4K16. These results define a minimal set of components that mediate heterochromatic gene silencing and demonstrate distinct contributions for histone deacetylation and nucleosome binding in the silencing mechanism Inhibition of histone deacetylase suppresses EGF signaling pathways by destabilizing EGFR mRNA in ER-negative human breast cancer cells. Our previous studies demonstrate that histone deacetylation plays a key role in ER gene silencing, and ER expression can be restored with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in ER-negative human breast cancer cells. This chromatin pattern, and particularly H3K4me2 levels, crisply separates DNA-hypermethylated genes from those where histone deacetylation is responsible for transcriptional silencing. Loss of gene expression is not due to structural mutations, but to regulatory changes including epigenetic deacetylation of histones. We found that these PERV families are differentially up- or downregulated upon chemical inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in cultured porcine cells. The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as transcriptional repressors by altering chromatin structure through histone deacetylation. The Set3 histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) binds histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) to mediate deacetylation of histones in 5'-transcribed regions. Core histone modifications play an important role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. MTA1 acts as part of a nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. The ectopic expression of ThPOK resulted in increased recruitment of histone deacetylases at Cd8 loci; the enhanced deacetylation of Cd8 genes eventually led to impaired Cd8 transcription. Sirt-1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase, has been linked to transcriptional silencing and appears to play a key role in inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Histone deacetylation regulates chromatin remodeling and transcriptional down-regulation of specific genomic regions; it is altered in many types of cancer cells. Histone acetylations affect the regulation of gene transcription, and the loss of learning induced deacetylation at specific histone sites may represent biomarkers for memory loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing chromatin accessibility via inhibition of histone deacetylation or DNA methylation lowered the induction threshold, demonstrating that chromatin accessibility sets the level of RelA required to activate gene expression. The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 antagonizes p53 transcriptional activity to regulate cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. These studies reveal a new mechanism by which acetyltransferase activity induces gene expression through targeted destruction of a transcriptional repressor. Further studies indicated that GR recruited histone deacetylase 1 to the Runx2 P2 promoter which then mediated the deacetylation of histone H4 and down-regulated Runx2 expression. RUNX2 cofactors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription. In some cell lines latently infected with EBV, an HDAC inhibitor alone can induce BZLF1 transcription, while the treatment does not enhance expression in other cell lines, such as B95-8 or Raji cells, suggesting unknown suppressive mechanisms besides histone deacetylation in those cells. Furthermore, the deacetylation of p53 by EWS-Fli1 suppressed its transcriptional activity and enhanced mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This finding suggests that HDACs have two arms for gene silencing: transcriptional repression by promoter histone deacetylation and post-transcriptional inhibition by increasing miRNA abundance. Promoter-localized deacetylation of H3 tails is a prerequisite for VprBP to tether and act as a bona fide inhibitor at p53 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply an important role for histone deacetylation in the downregulation of E-cadherin in human pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of transcription results from the release of p300 coactivator from NF-κB target gene promoters and subsequent histone deacetylation. In fungi in general, gene expression is often partially controlled at the chromatin level in secondary metabolism; when this is the case, the deacetylation and acetylation (and other posttranslational modifications) of histones are usually crucial in the regulation of transcription. For the first time, we provide direct evidence that CREMα mediates silencing of the IL2 gene in SLE T cells though histone deacetylation and CpG-DNA methylation. The downregulation             of CD43 mRNA is caused by p53-dependent transrepression, at least in part, via             a histone deacetylation mechanism. DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. Acetylation of histones is generally associated with open and transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the activity of HDACs leads to histone deacetylation, condensation of chromatin, and inhibition of transcription. This study demonstrates that a mutual cross-talk mechanism exists between histone chaperones and histone deacetylation in transcriptional regulation. FVE is a homologue of the mammalian retinoblastoma-associated protein (RbAp), one component of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex involved in transcriptional repression, and has been shown to be involved in the deacetylation of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) chromatin encoding for a repressor of flowering. Thus, our data illustrate the orchestration of a sequential epigenetic mechanism including the histone deacetylation and methylation, and the DNA methylation processes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) mediate histone deacetylation and act in concert with histone acetyltransferases to regulate dynamic and reversible histone acetylation which modifies chromatin structure and function, affects gene transcription, thus, controlling multiple cellular processes. We hypothesized that the episomal nature of IDLVs turns them into preferential targets for epigenetic silencing involving chromatin-remodeling histone deacetylation. Silencing involves epigenetic mechanisms, including histone deacetylation. Jmjd3 transcription is not induced in Atf4-knock-out cells, but the AAR-dependent activation was rescued by inhibition of histone deacetylation with trichostatin A (TSA). We conclude that histone deacetylation is specifically required for the earliest events in appendage regeneration in amphibians, and suggest that this may act as a switch to trigger re-expression of developmental genes. Inhibition of DNA methylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza) and histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in upregulation of EP2 mRNA in all cell lines with varying influences of each epigenetic process observed. During cancer development, tumor suppressor genes were silenced by promoter methylation or histone deacetylation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important to maintain histone deacetylation. Suppression of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation normalized Pomc expression and functional abnormalities.	['Histone deacetylation, catalyzed by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, is an epigenetic modification. Histone deacetylation leads to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally repressive chromatin structure which inhibits gene transcription. ']

530cf54dab4de4de0c000009	What is the reason for the narcolepsy cases developed after H1N1 influenza vaccination?	The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility.  The loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (hcrt) producing neurons causes narcolepsy with cataplexy. An autoimmune basis for the disease has long been suspected and recent results have greatly strengthened this hypothesis.  pointing towards processes such as molecular mimicry or bystander activation as crucial for disease development.  Although no formal link can be established, the unusual characteristics of the reported cases and the striking temporal relationship suggests that narcolepsy may be the result of an autoimmune reaction triggered by H1N1 vaccination in susceptible individuals. Pandemrix vaccination is a precipitating factor for narcolepsy, especially in combination with HLA-DQB1*0602.  Recently identified autoantibodies to Tribbles homologue 2 in some patients, as well as cases associated with H1N1 vaccination, support an autoimmune mechanism.  n China, narcolepsy onset is highly correlated with seasonal and annual patterns of upper airway infections, including H1N1 influenza. In 2010, the peak seasonal onset of narcolepsy was phase delayed by 6 months relative to winter H1N1 infections, and the correlation was independent of H1N1 vaccination in the majority of the sample. H1N1 vaccination was strongly associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy-cataplexy in both children and adults in France	['The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility.']

602747921cb411341a0000e0	What is the mechanism of action of vosoritide?	TransCon CNP is a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-38) conjugated via a cleavable linker to a polyethylene glycol carrier molecule, designed to provide sustained systemic CNP levels upon weekly subcutaneous administration. TransCon CNP is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia. In both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, sustained exposure to CNP via TransCon CNP was more efficacious in stimulating bone growth than intermittent CNP exposure. TransCon CNP was well tolerated with no adverse cardiovascular effects observed at exposure levels exceeding the expected clinical therapeutic exposure. At equivalent dose levels, reductions in blood pressure and/or an increase in heart rate were seen following single subcutaneous injections of the unconjugated CNP-38 molecule or a daily CNP-39 molecule (same amino acid sequence as Vosoritide, USAN:INN).

53340ca4d6d3ac6a34000042	How Flaviviridae family of viruses infects vertebrates?	(WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that cycles between mosquitoes and birds but that can also infect humans, horses, and other vertebrate animals. In most humans, WNV infection remains subclinical. However, 20%-40% of those infected may develop WNV disease, with symptoms ranging from fever to meningoencephalitis. A large variety of WNV strains have been described worldwide can be parasitized by Ixodid ticks, which may be infected with tick-borne pathogens, like Borrelia spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma, Rickettsia/Coxiella, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. The prevalence of ticks on birds varies over years, season, locality and different bird species. The prevalence of ticks on different species depends mainly on the degree of feeding on the ground. In Europe, the Turdus spp., especially the blackbird, Turdus merula, appears to be most important for harboring ticks. Birds can easily cross barriers, like fences, mountains, glaciers, desserts and oceans, which would stop mammals, and they can move much faster than the wingless hosts. Birds can potentially transport tick-borne pathogens by transporting infected ticks, by being infected with tick-borne pathogens and transmit the pathogens to the ticks, and possibly act as hosts for transfer of pathogens between ticks through co-feeding. The dengue viruses (DENVs) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes. Illness manifests across a clinical spectrum with severe disease characterized by intravascular volume depletion and hemorrhage. Recent estimates on the burden of DENV infection determined that there are 390 million dengue infections per year, three times the current estimate by the WHO (WNV), an arbovirus maintained in a bird-mosquito enzootic cycle, can infect other vertebrates including humans (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the Japanese encephalitis antigenic group, has caused sporadic outbreaks in humans, horses and birds throughout many of the warmer regions of Europe for at least 20 years. Occasional cases of West Nile encephalitis have also been associated with infected blood transfusions and organ donations Dengue is the most important vector-borne disease in many different parts of the world and is expanding into other areas of the globe without hindrance. The morbidity and mortality due to dengue complications are increasing globally at an alarming rate. Although transmission of the dengue virus has been documented in well-characterized areas of Pakistan, its incidence in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa has not been characterized  A rising incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected MSM has been observed since 2000 in Europe, Australia, USA and Asia. Transmission appears to occur through the permucosal rather than the more usual parenteral route. Although often multifactorial, permucosal risk factors can be classified as behavioural (sexual practices and mucosally administered drugs) and biological (HIV and sexually transmitted infections). This review will describe the epidemiology of HCV infection in this cohort. Current and future treatment strategies will also be outlined in the context of novel, orally bioavailable, directly acting antiviral therapies The genus Flavivirus currently consists of approximately 80 single-strand positive-sense RNA viruses. These replicate in a range of hosts including myriad vertebrate, insect, and tick species. As a consequence of this broad host range, the majority of flaviviruses can be propagated in most vertebrate and insect cell cultures. This ability to infect arthropods and vertebrates usually is essential for maintenance of these viruses in nature. But recently, there has been the discovery of a number of flaviviruses that infect mosquitoes but not vertebrates. It remains largely unknown why certain flaviviruses infect vertebrates and mosquitoes while others infect mosquitoes or vertebrates exclusively Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission among people who inject drugs remains a challenging public health problem. We investigated the risk of HCV transmission by analyzing the direct association of HCV with filters, water to dilute drugs, and water containers  is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four closely related dengue virus (genus Flavivirus)serotypes (DENV-1–4)  West Nile viruses are enveloped RNA viruses that belong to genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and are considered important mosquito-borne viral pathogenic agents worldwide  (JEV) is a mosquito-borne pathogenic flavivirus responsible for acute viral encephalitis in humans Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is not infrequent among haemodialysis patients. Most published reports suggest that patient-to-patient spread, either directly or indirectly, is the most common mode of transmission in renal units POWV) is a rare tick-borne agent of encephalitis in North America. Historically, confirmed cases occurred mainly in the northeastern United State (WNV) is a zoonotic arthropod-borne pathogen with continued geographical expansion in Europe. We present and evaluate data on the temporal, spatial and bird species focus of the WNV surveillance programme in dead wild birds in Great Britain  YFV) is historically one of the most important viruses to affect human populations. Despite the existence of highly effective vaccines for over 70 years, yellow fever remains a significant and re-emerging cause of morbidity and mortality in endemic and high-risk regions of South America and Africa. The virus may be maintained in sylvatic enzootic/epizootic, transitional and urban epidemic transmission cycles with geographic variation in terms of levels of genetic diversity, the nature of transmission cycles and patterns of outbreak activity. is a systemic arthropod-borne viral disease of major global public health importance. At least 2.5 billion people who live in areas of the world where dengue occurs are at risk of developing dengue fever (DF) and its severe complications, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).   is a mosquito-transmitted infection that poses significant global health risks for travelers and individuals living in the tropics and subtropics. (WNV) (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) is transmitted from mosquitoes to birds, but can cause fatal encephalitis in infected humans. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus within the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex. The enzootic virus cycle involves transmission between avian hosts and ornithophilic mosquitoes, whereas humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts  four major flavivirus clades are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, directly between vertebrates or directly between arthropods, respectively, but the molecular determinants of mode of transmission in flaviviruses are unknown.   Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), one of the most prevalent arboviruses in Europe and in many parts of Asia. Transmission of TBEV to humans usually occurs by bite of an infected tick or rarely by ingestion of unpasteurized milk products of infected livestock.  Most alphaviruses and flaviviruses survive in nature by replicating alternately in a vertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some flaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a viremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus replicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary secretions to another vertebrate host Western Hemisphere have drawn attention to West Nile virus (WNV) as an international public health problem. Of particular concern has been the ability for the virus to cause outbreaks of disease in highly populated urban centers. Incrimination of Australian mosquito species is an essential component in determining the receptivity of Australia to the introduction and/or establishment of an exotic strain of WNV and can guide potential management strategies. Based on vector competence experiments and ecological studies, we suggest candidate Australian mosquito species that would most likely be involved in urban transmission of WNV, along with consideration of the endemic WNV subtype, Kunjin	['A wide range of about 500 different viruses is transmitted by arthropods such as ticks, mosquitoes and sandflies. These arboviruses multiply in the arthropod vector, and for each virus there is a natural cycle involving vertebrates (various birds or mammals) and arthropods. The virus enters the arthropod when the latter takes a blood meal from the infected vertebrate, and passes through the gut wall to reach the salivary gland where replication takes place. Once this has occurred, 1–2 weeks after ingesting the virus, the arthropod becomes infectious, and can transmit the virus to another vertebrate during a blood meal. Certain arboviruses that infect ticks are also transmitted directly from adult tick to egg (transovarial transmission), so that future generations of ticks are infected without the need for a vertebrate host.']

Efficacy and safety data suggest that some of these oral Jak inhibitors as well as their topical formulations may soon enter the daily clinical practice for treating patients with psoriasis, lupus erythematosus or other inflammatory skin diseases.  Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase essential for signaling via cytokine receptors that comprise the common gamma-chain (gammac), i.e., the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the IFN-γ and γc cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and reversed established disease Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor being investigated for psoriasis.We sought to report longer-term tofacitinib efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.Data from 2 identical phase-III studies, Oral-treatment Psoriasis Trial Pivotal 1 and 2, were pooled with data from these patients in an ongoing open-label long-term extension study. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic and often debilitating skin disorder and proinflammatory cytokines are known to play a key role in the disease process.To evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study.Patients were randomized (n = 271) to receive placebo or oral baricitinib at 2, 4, 8 or 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks (Part A).

This signalling pathway is involved in haematopoiesis and immune development. Mutations in genes regulating JAK-STAT signalling can cause common inflammatory disorders and myeloproliferative disorders. JAK and STAT inhibitors are new management tools for disorders such as myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new version of MCAST that offers improved graphical output, a dynamic background model, statistical confidence estimates based on false discovery rate estimation and, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into account epigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We demonstrate the validity of MCAST's statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in identifying CRMs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MCAST is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at http://meme-suite.org and http://alternate.meme-suite.org On a data set of 16 gap and pair-rule genes containing 52 known CRMs, predictions made by HexDiff had a higher correlation with the known CRMs than several existing CRM prediction algorithms: Ahab, Cluster Buster, MSCAN, MCAST, and LWF.  The p-value scoring also allows mcast to only accept motif occurrences with significance below a user-specified threshold, while still assigning better scores to motif occurrences with lower p-values. mcast can search long DNA sequences, modeling length distributions between motifs within a regulatory module, but ignoring length distributions between modules.  Given a collection of known transcription factor binding motifs, many bioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying within a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those motifs.The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. The algorithm, called mcast, takes as input a DNA database and a collection of binding site motifs that are known to operate in concert. mcast uses a motif-based hidden Markov model with several novel features.

5c6e12247c78d6947100004b	Describe Herpetic Whitlow.	Superficial hand infections are located superficial to the tendons and are comprised of cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp-space infections, herpetic whitlow, and include volar as well as dorsal subcutaneous abscesses.  CONTEXT: Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes virus (type1 or 2) during primary infection or as result of autoinoculation. Commonly, it is caused by HSV-2 in adults with positive history for genital infection. CONCLUSION: The case here reported demonstrates that herpetic whitlow should be kept in mind by physicians in recurrent cases of fingers infection.  INTRODUCTION: Whitlow is an infection of a finger or around the fingernails, generally caused by bacterium. However, in rare cases, it may also be caused by the herpes simplex virus. As herpetic whitlow is not seen often, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger.  He had multiple vesicles on the finger, which led to the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which we confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing.  Herpetic whitlow is an acute viral infection of the hand caused by either herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 or 2. Its characteristic findings are significant pain and erythema with overlying nonpurulent vesicles. Herpetic whitlow, a herpes simplex virus infection involving the digits, most commonly presents as a vesicular eruption involving a single digit. Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus infection of the finger. Herpetic whitlow is a painful cutaneous infection that most commonly affects the distal phalanx of the fingers and occasionally the toes. Herpetic whitlow may have a prodrome of burning, pruritus, and/or tingling of the affected finger or the entire limb, followed by erythema, pain, and vesicle formation. UNLABELLED Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection of the fingers characterised by erythema and painful, non-purulent vesicles. This paper describes a case of transmission of herpetic whitlow to the index finger of a dental student from a patient with herpes simplex virus. UNLABELLED Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection of the fingers characterised by erythema and painful, non-purulent vesicles.

MMR regulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic properties of MutY promotes stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis cells. To further examine the correlation between transcription and adaptive mutation, we placed a point-mutated allele, leuC427, under the control of an inducible promoter and assayed the level of reversion to leucine prototrophy under conditions of leucine starvation.

5c6f0ebf7c78d69471000050	What is the mechanism of action of Pitolisant?	The histamine H3 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug target that is highly expressed in the CNS, where it acts as both an auto- and hetero-receptor to regulate neurotransmission. As such, it has been considered as a relevant target in disorders as varied as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A range of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists have progressed into clinical development, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Given the breadth of compounds developed and potential therapeutic indications, we assessed the comparative pharmacology of six investigational histamine H3 agents, including pitolisant, using native tissue and recombinant cells. Whilst all of the compounds tested displayed robust histamine H3 receptor inverse agonism and did not differentiate between the main H3 receptor splice variants, they displayed a wide range of affinities and kinetic properties, and included rapidly dissociating (pitolisant, S 38093-2, ABT-239) and slowly dissociating (GSK189254, JNJ-5207852, PF-3654746) agents. Furthermore, pitolisant, ABT-239 and PF-3654746 also displayed appreciable sigma-1 receptor affinity, suggesting that this property differentiates clinically evaluated histamine H3 receptor antagonists and may play a role in their efficacy. The pharmacological profile of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, indicates that this compound might reduce body weight and metabolic disturbances.   Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol [JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium oxybate, and the H3-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. In March 2016, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for pitolisant (WakixR) (as the first representative of the H3 inverse agonists) for the treatment of narcolepsy. The involvement of histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) in memory is well known, and the potential of H3R antagonists in therapeutic management of neuropsychiatric diseases, e.g., Alzheimer disease (AD) is well established. Therefore, the effects of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonist E159 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male rats on dizocilpine (DIZ)-induced memory deficits were studied in passive avoidance paradigm (PAP) and in novel object recognition (NOR) using pitolisant (PIT) and donepezil (DOZ) as standard drugs. Pitolisant is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the human histamine H3 receptor.  The small molecule drug, pitolisant, acts as an inverse agonist/antagonist at the H3 receptor, thus increasing histaminergic tone in the wake promoting system of the brain.

Pitolisant, an inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor: an alternative stimulant for narcolepsy-cataplexy in teenagers with refractory sleepiness.Pitolisant could constitute an acceptable alternative for the treatment of refractory sleepiness in teenagers with narcolepsy. In contrast, Pitolisant is a non-imidazole H3 receptor inverse agonist that has already been tested in clinical trials but it remains to be determined whether this compound also potentiates the behavioral effects of cocaine. BACKGROUND Pitolisant (BF2.649) is a nonimidazole histamine 3 receptor antagonist. Pitolisant is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the human histamine H3 receptor. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant (previously called BF2.649), a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that activates these neurons, in patients with narcolepsy.

531881acb166e2b806000017	What is the role of Hsp90 inhibition in cancer therapy?	Geldanamycin (GA) can be considered a relatively new component with a promising mode of action against human malignancies. It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone. In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling -oncogenic- integrity. Low-dose Hsp90 inhibitors tumor-selectively sensitize bladder cancer cells to chemoradiotherapy Hsp90 inhibitors at low concentrations, which did not exert cytocidal effects but inactivated key anti-apoptotic proteins including erbB2, Akt, and NF-κB, efficiently sensitized bladder cancer cells (T24, 5637 and UM-UC-3 cells) to in vitro CRT by enhancing apoptosis. In mice UM-UC-3 tumor xenografts model, Hsp90 inhibitors successfully potentiated anti-tumor activity of CRT. The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), which simultaneously inactivated both Akt and ERK signaling at noncytocidal concentrations, synergistically potentiated the cytotoxicity of CDDP against BCICs by enhancing CDDP-induced apoptosis in vitro. We have demonstrated that, upon 17-AAG treatment, bladder cancer cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and eventually undergo apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 17-AAG administration was shown to induce a pronounced downregulation of multiple Hsp90 protein clients and other downstream effectors, such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-α, IKK-β, FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, resulting in sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-κB, reduced cell proliferation and decline of cell motility. In total, we have clearly evinced a dose-dependent and cell type-specific effect of 17-AAG on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of multiple Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling integrity. Low dose geldanamycin inhibits hepatocyte growth factor and hypoxia-stimulated invasion of cancer cells GA downregulated Met by inhibiting new protein maturation, thereby dampening HGF signaling. HGF and chemical hypoxia with CoCl2 cooperatively promoted in vitro invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, while CoCl2 but not HGF activated urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase 2, both of which promote invasion and angiogenesis. Low dose GA (100 nmol/L) inhibited these processes by suppressing both HGF and HIF-1 pathways. Notably, brief GA pretreatment inhibited in vitro invasion and VEGF secretion induced by HGF as effectively as did continuous treatment. Moreover, we found that GA inhibited activation of focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion assembly, and actin reorganization induced by HGF and integrin engagement by extracellular matrix. GA widely suppresses extrinsic stimuli-induced signaling that contribute to tumor invasion and angiogenesis in this bladder carcinoma model, suggesting the utility of Hsp90 inhibitors in preventing tumor progression and metastasis. upon geldanamycin treatment, bladder cancer cells are prominently arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and eventually undergo programmed cell death via combined activation of apoptosis and autophagy. geldanamycin administration proved to induce prominent downregulation of several Hsp90 protein clients and downstream effectors, such as membrane receptors (IGF-IR and c-Met), protein kinases (Akt, IKKα, IKKβ and Erk1/2) and transcription factors (FOXOs and NF-κΒ), therefore resulting in the impairment of proliferative -oncogenic- signaling and reduction of cell motility 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic, specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone that maintains the structural and functional integrity of various protein clients involved in cellular signalin	['Hsp90 inhibition is followed by G1/S cell cycle arrest, downregulation of key signalling proteins such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-α, IKK-β, FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, and sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-κB, resulting in disruption of oncogenic signalling integrity, reduced cell proliferation, decline of cell motility, enhanced apoptotic cell death, and finally, sensitization of cancer cells to additional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.']
52bf1df903868f1b06000013	What is the mechanism of action of Nalmefene?	Opioids that stimulate the μ-opioid receptor (MOR1) are the most frequently prescribed and effective analgesics. Here we present a structural model of MOR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show a ligand-dependent increase in the conformational flexibility of the third intracellular loop that couples with the G protein complex. These simulations likewise identified residues that form frequent contacts with ligands. We validated the binding residues using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with radioligand binding and functional assays. The model was used to blindly screen a library of ∼1.2 million compounds. From the 34 compounds predicted to be strong binders, the top three candidates were examined using biochemical assays. One compound showed high efficacy and potency. Post hoc testing revealed this compound to be nalmefene, a potent clinically used antagonist, thus further validating the model.  The neurobiological mechanism by which opioid modulators affect drinking behavior is based on the strong connection between the endogenous opioid system, the dopamine system and the influence of the CNS stress response. Naltrexone- and to a lesser extent nalmefene- is an agent that modulates opioidergic transmission in the CNS and it shows a limited but well-studied efficacy in treating alcohol dependence.  Several derivatives of Naltrexone, Nalmefene (Nal) and JKB-119, exert immunomodulatory activity; however, unlike Nal, JKB-119 does not show significant opioid receptor antagonism.

In preclinical study, G-CSF and erythropoietin improved cardiac function and perfusion by angiomyogenesis and protection of cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction. However, results from recent clinical trials did not support beneficial effects of cytokine therapy with G-CSF or erythropoietin alone in patients with myocardial infarction.

5880e089c872c9556500000b	What is the mechanism of action of Romosozumab?	The current review will focus on emerging treatments of osteoporosis with the potential of enhanced anabolic effects (romosozumab and abaloparatide) or uncoupling of resorption and formation (odanacatib and romosozumab) as well as the effect of combination therapy. Newer anabolic agents are imminent and include an analogue of parathyroid hormone-related protein, abaloparatide, and a humanised monoclonal antibody to an inhibitor of bone formation, romosozumab.   Several humanized monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin, including romosozumab and blosozumab, are now in clinical development.  Romosozumab, an antibody raised against sclerostin, is a promising bone anabolic agent. Romosozumab inhibits sclerostin, thereby increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. This dual effect of romosozumab leads to rapid and substantial increases in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  Phase I and II studies of the two humanized sclerostin monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab and blosozumab, both of which have had positive effects on bone mineral density. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Romosozumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds and blocks the action of sclerostin, a protein secreted by the osteocyte and an extracellular inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of action of this signaling molecule have led to the development of a pharmacological inhibitor of sclerostin with potential clinical applications as an osteoanabolic drug for the treatment of osteoporosis.Romosozumab is the first humanized monoclonal sclerostin antibody to be tested in clinical trials Update on romosozumab : a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin. Multiple doses of sclerostin antibody romosozumab in healthy men and postmenopausal women with low bone mass: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. AREAS COVERED: Romosozumab is the first humanized monoclonal sclerostin antibody to be tested in clinical trials.  The monoclonal antibody romosozumab binds to sclerostin and increases bone formation.  Romosozumab (formerly AMG 785/CDP7851) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks sclerostin from inhibiting osteoblast maturation and function.  Romosozumab, an antibody raised against sclerostin, is a promising bone anabolic agent.  Phase II clinical trials with anti-sclerostin antibodies, romosozumab and blosozumab, demonstrated a marked increase in bone mineral density after one year of treatment. Similar to preclinical animal studies with sclerostin antibodies, initial clinical studies show that romosozumab increases bone formation and bone mineral density.EXPERT OPINION: Blocking sclerostin action with romosozumab is a promising new therapeutic approach to osteoanabolic therapy of osteoporosis; efficacy and safety data on large controlled studies are awaited. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of action of this signaling molecule have led to the development of a pharmacological inhibitor of sclerostin with potential clinical applications as an osteoanabolic drug for the treatment of osteoporosis.AREAS COVERED: Romosozumab is the first humanized monoclonal sclerostin antibody to be tested in clinical trials.

The PI3Kα Inhibitor Alpelisib Has Activity in The PI3Kα inhibitor alpelisib achieved a 58.2% disease control rate in PIK3CA-altered solid tumors. Purpose: We describe herein a novel P447_L455 deletion in the C2 domain of PIK3CA in a patient with an ER+ breast cancer with an excellent response to the PI3Kα inhibitor alpelisib.  Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase α-Selective Inhibition With Alpelisib (BYL719) in PIK3CA-Altered Solid Tumors: Results From the First-in-Human Study. Purpose We report the first-in-human phase Ia study to our knowledge ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01219699) identifying the maximum tolerated dose and assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of single-agent alpelisib (BYL719), an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα)-selective inhibitor.  Here, we have determined the effects of new anticancer drugs targeting specific PI3K isoforms on INaL and action potentials (APs) in mouse cardiomyocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Chronic exposure (10-100 nM; 5-48 hours) to PI3K-α-specific subunit inhibitors BYL710 (alpelisib) and A66 and a pan-PI3K inhibitor (BKM120) increased INaL in SCN5A-transfected CHO cells and mouse cardiomyocytes.  Combining ribociclib with the alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed a synergistic effect in two NPC PDX models in nude mice.  his study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC. This study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC. PURPOSE Alpelisib, a selective oral inhibitor of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110α, has shown synergistic antitumor activity with endocrine therapy against ER+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer cells. We explored whether PI3K inhibitors, buparlisib and alpelisib, enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen against ER-positive BC cells. PI3K inhibitors, including the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) and the PI3Kα-selective inhibitor alpelisib (BYL719), currently in clinical development by Novartis Oncology, may therefore be effective as anticancer agents. PURPOSE Alpelisib, a selective oral inhibitor of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110α, has shown synergistic antitumor activity with endocrine therapy against ER+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer cells. Patients with refractory BRAFV600-mutant metastatic CRC (mCRC) were treated with a selective RAF kinase inhibitor (encorafenib) plus a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR (cetuximab), with (n = 28) or without (n = 26) a PI3Kα inhibitor (alpelisib). Combining ribociclib with the alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed a synergistic effect in two NPC PDX models in nude mice. We assessed the safety and activity of alpelisib, an oral, selective PI3K p110α inhibitor, plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC.<br><b>METHODS</b>: Patients with HER2-positive MBC that had progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy were treated with alpelisib daily and T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

606080eb94d57fd879000040	Describe MSstatsTMT	MSstatsTMT: Statistical Detection of Differentially Abundant Proteins in Experiments with Isobaric Labeling and Multiple Mixtures. This manuscript proposes a general statistical approach for relative protein quantification in MS- based experiments with TMT labeling. It is applicable to experiments with multiple conditions, multiple biological replicate runs and multiple technical replicate runs, and unbalanced designs. It is based on a flexible family of linear mixed-effects models that handle complex patterns of technical artifacts and missing values. The approach is implemented in MSstatsTMT, a freely available open-source R/Bioconductor package compatible with data processing tools such as Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, OpenMS, and SpectroMine. Evaluation on a controlled mixture, simulated datasets, and three biological investigations with diverse designs demonstrated that MSstatsTMT balanced the sensitivity and the specificity of detecting differentially abundant proteins, in large-scale experiments with multiple biological mixtures.

6026b0e01cb411341a0000ca	Describe the role of epidermal CYLD inactivation in sebaceous and basaloid skin tumors	Epidermal CYLD inactivation sensitizes mice to the development of sebaceous and basaloid skin tumors. The deubiquitinase-encoding gene Cyld displays a dominant genetic linkage to a wide spectrum of skin-appendage tumors, which could be collectively designated as CYLD mutant-syndrome (CYLDm-syndrome). Despite recent advances, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this painful and difficult-to-treat skin disease. Here, we generated a conditional mouse model with epidermis-targeted expression of a catalytically deficient CYLDm through K14-Cre-mediated deletion of exon 9 (hereafter refer to CyldEΔ9/Δ9 ). CyldEΔ9/Δ9 mice were born alive but developed hair and sebaceous gland abnormalities and dental defects at 100% and 60% penetrance, respectively. Upon topical challenge with DMBA/TPA, these animals primarily developed sebaceous and basaloid tumors resembling human CYLDm-syndrome as opposed to papilloma, which is most commonly induced in WT mice by this treatment. Molecular analysis revealed that TRAF6-K63-Ubiquitination (K63-Ub), c-Myc-K63-Ub, and phospho-c-Myc (S62) were markedly elevated in CyldEΔ9/Δ9 skin. Topical treatment with a pharmacological c-Myc inhibitor induced sebaceous and basal cell apoptosis in CyldEΔ9/Δ9 skin. Consistently, c-Myc activation was readily detected in human cylindroma and sebaceous adenoma. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CyldEΔ9/Δ9 mice represent a disease-relevant animal model and identify TRAF6 and c-Myc as potential therapeutic targets for CYLDm-syndrome.

56af573b0a360a5e45000011	What is SHAPE-Seq?	This article contains a protocol for selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and sequencing (SHAPE-Seq) that, through a combination of structure-dependent chemical probing and next-generation sequencing technologies, achieves structural characterization of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment. This protocol is applicable in a variety of conditions, and represents an important tool for understanding RNA biology. The protocol includes methods for the design and synthesis of RNA mixtures for study, and the construction and analysis of structure-dependent sequencing libraries that reveal structural information of the RNAs in the mixtures. The methods are generally applicable to studying RNA structure and interactions in vitro in a variety of conditions, and allows for the rapid characterization of RNA structures in a high-throughput manner. We focus on a novel assay utilizing this approach, called selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), that can be used to characterize RNA secondary and tertiary structure. We describe a fully automated data analysis pipeline for SHAPE-Seq analysis that includes read processing, mapping, and structural inference based on a model of the experiment. Our methods rely on the solution of a series of convex optimization problems for which we develop efficient and effective numerical algorithms. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems. As part of this optimization, we present SHAPE-Seq v2.0, a 'universal' method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase priming site within the RNA. We show that SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE methods. We anticipate SHAPE-Seq v2.0 to be broadly applicable to understanding the RNA sequence-structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most fundamental processes.

We propose a new approach, using chromatin assortativity, to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts Polycomb group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centered networks.  We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared with inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Here, we use publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types.

532ad531d6d3ac6a34000013	What is the basic secondary structure of the variable domains of a typical antibody?	Antibodies are prototypes of multimeric proteins and consist of structurally similar domains. The two variable domains of an antibody (VH and VL) interact through a large hydrophobic interface and can be expressed as covalently linked single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments.  Secondary structure formation, measured by H/D-exchange protection, of a mutant scFv fragment of an antibody after short incubation in 6 M guanidinium chloride was shown to be multiphasic. NMR analysis shows that an intermediate with significant proton protection is observed within the dead time of the manual mixing experiments. Subsequently, the folding reaction proceeds via a biphasic reaction and mass spectrometry analyses of the exchange experiments confirm the existence of two parallel pathways. In the presence of cyclophilin, however, the faster of the two phases vanishes (when followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), while the slower phase is not significantly enhanced by equimolar cyclophilin e formation of an early intermediate, which shows amide-proton exchange protection, is independent of proline isomerization. Subsequently, a proline cis-trans isomerization reaction in the rapidly formed intermediate, producing 'non-native' isomers, competes with the fast formation of native species. Interface formation in a folding intermediate of the scFv fragment is proposed to prevent the back-isomerization of these prolines from being efficiently catalyzed by cyclophilin.  heavy chain variable domains (VH) lacking their light chain (VL) partner are prime candidates for the design of minimum-size immunoreagents. 	["The variable domains of heavy and light chains of antibodies consist of two β-sheets. The first one is composed of four strands, A, B, E and D, and the second one is composed of six strands, named A', G, F, C, C' and C''.

58ab1e19396a458e5000000f	What is the function of yeast Clr4 on chromatin?	Mutations in the clr4+, rik1+ and swi6+ genes dramatically reduce silencing at certain centromeric regions and cause elevated chromosome loss rates The Swi6 protein was found to be delocalised from all three silent chromosomal regions, and dispersed within the nucleus, in both clr4 and rik1 mutant cells.  Mutations in clr4, rik1 and swi6 also result in elevated sensitivity to reagents which destabilise microtubules and show a synergistic interaction with a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene (nda3). These observations suggest that clr4+ and rik1+ must play a role in the assembly of Swi6p into a transcriptionally silent, inaccessible chromatin structure at fission yeast centromeres which is required to facilitate interactions with spindle microtubules and to ensure normal chromosome segregation. The chromo and SET domains of the Clr4 protein are essential for silencing in fission yeast. Like Su(var)3-9p, Clr4p contains SET and chromo domains, motifs found in proteins that modulate chromatin structure. Surprisingly, RNA differential display experiments demonstrated that clr4+ can mediate transcriptional activation of certain other loci. These results show that clr4 plays a critical role in silencing at mating-type loci and centromeres through the organization of repressive chromatin structure and demonstrate a new, activator function for Clr4p. Clr4 is known to regulate silencing and switching at the mating-type loci and to affect chromatin structure at centromeres.  Mutations in Cul4 result in defective localization of Clr4 and loss of silencing at heterochromatic loci. The Clr4 methyltransferase determines the subnuclear localization of the mating-type region in fission yeast. In a strain lacking the histone methyltransferase Clr4, crucial for the formation of heterochromatin, the mating-type region had a random localization in the nucleus. Cut4 and Cut9 interact directly with Swi6/HP1 and Clr4, whereas the mutant Cut4 does not, suggesting that a direct physical interaction of APC subunits Cut4 and Cut9 with Swi6 and Clr4 is instrumental in heterochromatin assembly. Thus, APC and heterochromatin proteins Swi6 and Clr4 play a mutually cooperative role in heterochromatin assembly, thereby ensuring chromosomal integrity, inheritance, and segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Positive feedback mechanisms that link the RNAi pathway and the Clr4/Suv39h1 histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex (Clr-C) result in requirements for H3K9 methylation for full siRNA production and for siRNA production to achieve full histone methylation. Heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast depends on the Clr4 histone methyltransferase, which targets H3K9. These analyses place Sir2 and H3K14 deacetylation upstream of Clr4 recruitment during heterochromatin assembly. These results show that clr4 plays a critical role in silencing at mating-type loci and centromeres through the organization of repressive chromatin structure and demonstrate a new, activator function for Clr4p These results show that clr4 plays a critical role in silencing at mating-type loci and centromeres through the organization of repressive chromatin structure and demonstrate a new, activator function for Clr4p..

On the basis of protein domain similarity, the human nucleoporin Nup153  human Nup153 mediate nuclear import In addition to being important to pore architecture, Nup153 is a key participant in both import and export During the transition into mitosis, Nup153 directs proteins involved in membrane remodeling to the nuclear envelope. Overall, the versatile nature of Nup153 underscores an emerging view of the nuclear pore at the nexus of many key cellular processes. Nucleoporin NUP153 guards genome integrity by promoting nuclear import of 53BP1. a nuclear pore component NUP153 as a novel factor specifically required for 53BP1 nuclear import.  The nuclear basket is composed of the 3 nucleoporins Nup153, Nup50, and Tpr, but their specific role for the structural organization of this NPC substructure is, however, not well established The nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with chromatin and regulates cardiac gene expression in dystrophic mdx hearts. The nucleoporin Nup153 has been implicated in the DNA damage response, attributed to a role in promoting nuclear import of 53BP1.  Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. In addition to being important to pore architecture, Nup153 is a key participant in both import and export. Finally, we show that the C-terminal part of NUP153 is required for effective 53BP1 nuclear import, and that 53BP1 is imported to the nucleus through the NUP153-importin-β interplay. Our data define the structure-function relationships within this emerging 53BP1-NUP153/importin-β pathway and implicate this mechanism in the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we provide the complete results of this screen as an information resource, and validate and functionally characterize one of the identified 'hits': a nuclear pore component NUP153 as a novel factor specifically required for 53BP1 nuclear import.

PI3K-mTORC1 attenuates stress response by inhibiting cap-independent Hsp70 translation stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling Conversely, Hsp70 synthesis is enhanced under the reduced PI3K-mTORC1 signaling Our findings imply a plausible mechanism for how persistent PI3K-mTORC1 signaling favors the development of age-related pathologies by attenuating stress resistance One prominent example is the selective translation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) under stress conditions.

Humans lack a functional cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) protein and cannot synthesize the sugar Neu5Gc, an innate mammalian signal of self. Losing this sugar changed how humans interact with some of our deadliest pathogens: malaria, influenza, and streptococcus among others. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies are detected in all human sera, though with variable levels and epitope-recognition profiles. These antibodies likely play a role in several inflammation-mediated pathologies including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Human polyclonal IgG antibodies directly against the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are potential biomarkers and mechanistic contributors to cancer and other diseases associated with chronic inflammation.  Human heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal erythrocytes are known to detect the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).  Nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc is very low in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors differentiated with B27/N2 and noggin A concern recently has been raised that human embryonic stem cell (HESC) lines cultured with currently available methods may have limited clinical usefulness due to the immunogenicity of the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc incorporated into their membranes during culturing.

58a2ccec60087bc10a000003	What is the composition of the gamma-secretase complex?	Gamma-secretase is a widely expressed multisubunit enzyme complex which is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and hematopoietic malignancies through its aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch1, respectively. Presenilin (PS1 or PS2) is the catalytic component of the gamma-secretase complex, which mediates the final proteolytic processing step leading to the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-characterizing amyloid beta-peptide.  gamma-Secretase is a membrane-embedded multi-protein complex that catalyzes the final cut of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-beta peptides of variable length (37-43 amino acids) via an unusual intramembrane cleavage. The gamma-secretase complex processes substrate proteins within membranes and consists of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. PS harbours the enzymatic activity of the complex, and there are two mammalian PS homologues: PS1 and PS2.  gamma-Secretase is known to contain four major protein constituents: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, all of which are integral membrane proteins.  Here we describe the association of all four components of the gamma-secretase complex, namely presenilin 1 (PS1)-derived fragments, mature nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, with cholesterol-rich detergent insoluble membrane (DIM) domains of non-neuronal cells and neurons that fulfill the criteria of lipid rafts.  In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with gamma-secretase complex components and for formation of an active gamma-secretase complex. Active gamma-secretase is a tetrameric protein complex consisting of presenilin-1 (or -2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and Aph-1a (or -1b). The gamma-secretase complex processes substrate proteins within membranes and consists of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Maturation of exogenous NCT, gamma-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. gamma-Secretase complexes containing N- and C-terminal fragments of different presenilin origin retain normal gamma-secretase activity. Co-overexpression of presenilin-1 or APH-1 abrogated gamma-secretase inhibition probably through prevention of the incorporation of CRB2 into the gamma-secretase complex We conclude that a PS1/Pen2/Aph1a trimeric complex is an active enzyme, displaying biochemical properties similar to those of gamma-secretase and roughly 50% of its activity when normalized to PS1 N-terminal fragment levels γ-Secretase is involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and of many other important physiological substrates. γ-secretase is a multiproteic complex made of four main core components, namely presenilin 1 or 2, APH-1, PEN-2, and Nicastrin Amyloid precursor protein associates with a nicastrin-dependent docking site on the presenilin 1-gamma-secretase complex in cells demonstrated by fluorescence lifetime imaging. Activity-dependent isolation of the presenilin- gamma -secretase complex reveals nicastrin and a gamma substrate. Characterization of the reconstituted gamma-secretase complex from Sf9 cells co-expressing presenilin 1, nicastrin [correction of nacastrin], aph-1a, and pen-2. p53-Dependent Aph-1 and Pen-2 anti-apoptotic phenotype requires the integrity of the gamma-secretase complex but is independent of its activity. Here we show that all known gamma-secretase complexes are active in APP processing and that all combinations of APH-1 variants with either FAD mutant PS1 or PS2 support pathogenic Abeta(42) production.  To characterize the functional similarity between complexes of various PS composition, we analysed PS1, PS2, and chimeric PS composed of the NTF from PS1 and CTF from PS2, or vice versa, in assembly and function of the gamma-secretase complex. While beta-secretase is a classical aspartyl protease, gamma-secretase activity is associated with a high molecular weight complex. One of the complex components, which is critically required for gamma-secretase activity is nicastrin (NCT). Here we investigate the assembly of NCT into the gamma-secretase complex. Maturation of exogenous NCT, gamma-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. This revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of NCT is dispensable for gamma-secretase complex assembly and function. In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with gamma-secretase complex components and for formation of an active gamma-secretase complex.

This could be demonstrated also in cell-free assays, where in addition presenilin-1, the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, was shifted out of lipid rafts. In PS1(-/-)/PS2(-/-) and NCT(-/-) fibroblasts, gamma-secretase components that still remain fail to become detergent-resistant, suggesting that raft association requires gamma-secretase complex assembly.

The 4D-CHAINS algorithm analyzes two 4D spectra recorded using a single, fully protonated protein sample in an iterative ansatz where common NOEs between different spin systems supplement conventional through-bond connectivities to establish assignments of sidechain and backbone resonances at high levels of completeness and with a minimum error rate. The 4D-CHAINS assignments are then used to guide automated assignment of long-range NOEs and structure refinement in autoNOE-Rosetta.

51492168d24251bc05000041	Which depression rating scales were shown to have acceptable psychometric properties for screening of poststroke depression?	The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD) (sensitivity: 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; specificity: 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (sensitivity: 0.84; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90; specificity:0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.90) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (sensitivity: 0.86; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94; specificity: 0.79; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90) appeared to be the optimal measures for screening measures. There are a number of possible instruments that may help in screening for poststroke depression but none are satisfactory for case-finding. Preliminary data suggests the CESD, HDRS or the PHQ-9 as the most promising options. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered. The balance of sensitivity and specificity was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Discriminating abilities of all the scales for major and all PSD were good (area under ROC values 0.88-0.93 and 0.88-0.92 at 2 weeks; and 0.93-0.96 and 0.89-0.91 at 1 year, respectively). We compared the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Visual Analogue Mood Scale, proxy assessment, and Clinical Global Impression of the nursing and study personnel, together with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, in assessing depression after stroke in a follow-up study of 100 patients. The sensitivity and specificity against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria were acceptable with the Clinical Global Impression, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, mostly in the range of 0.70 to 1.00. The Visual Analogue Mood Scale was not a sensitive instrument (sensitivity, 0.20 to 0.60) and did not correlate with the Beck Depression Inventory during the first year after stroke. Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Clinical Global Impression assessment by professionals, in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, are useful in assessing depression, but none of these instruments clearly stood apart from the others. Proxy ratings should be used with caution, and the use of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale among patients with aphasia and other cognitive impairments cannot be recommended. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS), a diagnostic tool specifically devised to assess depression after stroke, in comparison to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). At their optimum cut-off points, the Ham-D and PSDRS showed good sensitivity and specificity for MDL or MDL + MDDM; the PSDRS had a higher positive predictive value for MDL in respect of the Ham-D (78 vs. 59%). Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of the PSDRS was higher in respect of the Ham-D in aphasic patients. The Ham-D and PSDRS are both reliable diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of PSD. We suggest that the PSDRS could be a useful tool in clinical practice and in therapeutic trials. The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35.2%) patients as depressed. Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38.0%) and 18/30 (60.0%) patients as potentially depressed. The proportion of patients correctly identified as depressed by the test (sensitivity) when rated by nurses was 64%, and the proportion of patients not depressed who were correctly identified by the test (specificity) was 61%, whereas carers achieved sensitivity 90% and specificity 35%. The Signs of Depression Scale is easily completed by clinical staff, although we found the sensitivity when completed by nurses to be low. Information from carers shows potential to improve screening and it is important for nurses to value the knowledge and skills of carers in detecting depression following a stroke. Further refinement of the Signs of Depression Scale, with accompanying research, is required. The VAMS was not useful in screening for depression in Chinese stroke patients while both the HADS and the GDS demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. At their respective optimum cutoff values, the sensitivity of the self-rated scales varied between 80% and 90%, while the specificity was about 60%. For the observer-rated scale (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), sensitivity was 78.1%, and specificity was 74.6%. The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68% depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50% depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists). Although there were no marked differences in the screening abilities for PSD between the scales, differences were found in factors influencing misclassification. Assessment scales with less somatic items may be recommended for the screening of PSD, particularly at the acute phase of stroke.	['The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, The Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Poststroke Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scale appeared to have acceptable psychometric properties for identifying depression in patients after stroke. Therefore, these scales can be used for screening of post-stroke depression. Signs of Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Mood Scale showed inferior psychometric properties and therefore should not be used for screening for post-stroke depression.']

5d387e74a1e1595105000012	How is the mouse Fxy gene evolving?	We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations.   Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique. Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms. This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content. These results strongly suggest that recombination is the primary determinant of the isochore organization of mammalian genomes. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gen	[" Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique.", "The rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique."]
5a80d6cbfaa1ab7d2e000024	What is the role of Kmt5a in liver?	Kmt5a Controls Hepatic Metabolic Pathways by Facilitating RNA Pol II Release from Promoter-Proximal Regions. H4K20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic condensation, DNA damage response, and replication licensing. Here, we show that, in non-dividing hepatic cells, H4K20Me1 is specifically enriched in active gene bodies and dynamically regulated by the antagonistic action of Kmt5a methylase and Kdm7b demethylase. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced levels of H4K20Me1correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions. Genes regulating glucose and fatty acid metabolism were most sensitive to impairment of RNA Pol II release. Downregulation of glycolytic genes resulted in an energy starvation condition partially compensated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and increased mitochondrial activity. This metabolic reprogramming generated a highly sensitized state that, upon different metabolic stress conditions, quickly aggravated into a senescent phenotype due to ROS overproduction-mediated oxidative DNA damage. The results illustrate how defects in the general process of RNA Pol II transition into a productive elongation phase can trigger specific metabolic changes and genome instability. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced levels of H4K20Me correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions.

52b2f1014003448f5500000a	What is Snord116?	Further analysis with array-CGH identified a mosaic 847 kb deletion in 15q11-q13, including SNURF-SNRPN, the snoRNA gene clusters SNORD116 (HBII-85), SNORD115, (HBII-52), SNORD109 A and B (HBII-438A and B), SNORD64 (HBII-13), and NPAP1 (C15ORF2). All three deletions included SNORD116, but only two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome. Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  Small nucleolar (sno) RNAs are a group of small RNAs located in nucleoli that modulate chemical modifications and maturation of ribosomal or other RNAs. Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS. Data from mice revealed Snord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively. We demonstrate that the mouse C/D box snoRNA MBII-85 (SNORD116) is processed into at least five shorter RNAs using processing sites near known functional elements of C/D box snoRNAs. Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology  Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis.  Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS.

['SNORD116 is a small nucleolar (sno) RNA gene cluster (HBII-85) implicated as a major contributor the Prader-Willi phenotype. \nSNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS. \nSNORD116 is a paternally expressed box C/D snoRNA gene cluster.\nThe mouse C/D box snoRNA MBII-85 (SNORD116) is processed into at least five shorter RNAs using processing sites near known functional elements of C/D box snoRNAs.\nSnord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally.\nSnord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA.

5d35ef8a7bc3fee31f000002	How are SAHFS created?	These include measurement of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal), senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs), proliferative arrest, morphological changes, and expression and activity of proteins involved in the senescence process, such as p53 and Rb pathway proteins and secretory proteins Redistribution of the Lamin B1 genomic binding profile affects rearrangement of heterochromatic domains and SAHF formation during senescence. Senescent cells have a distinct gene expression profile, which is often accompanied by the spatial redistribution of heterochromatin into senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs)  Genome-wide mapping reveals that LMNB1 is depleted during senescence, preferentially from the central regions of lamina-associated domains (LADs), which are enriched for Lys9 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3). LMNB1 knockdown facilitates the spatial relocalization of perinuclear H3K9me3-positive heterochromatin, thus promoting SAHF formation, which could be inhibited by ectopic LMNB1 expression. nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers characterizes senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation in human fibroblasts.  Alterations of chromatin structure are believed to contribute to the irreversible nature of the senescent state. Senescent cells form characteristic heterochromatin structure called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may repress the expression of proliferation-promoting genes, such as E2F target genes. urprisingly, we show that the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins, which can promote tumorigenesis, accumulate on the chromatin of senescent fibroblasts and are essential structural components of SAHFs.  Remarkably, SAHF-positive senescent cells lose linker histone H1 and exhibit increased levels of chromatin-bound high mobility group A2 (HMGA2). Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressing mechanism that is accompanied by characteristic chromatin condensation called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). It is almost ten years since senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs) were first described in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs).  Thus the layered HOCS of SAHFs is likely achieved mainly through the spatial rearrangement of pre-existing heterochromatin, rather than spreading of heterochromatin. Evidence for the co-association of similar types of chromatin is emerging and SAHFs may provide a unique model system to study the correlation between HOCS and chromatin types, which are readily visible and regulable.	['Cellular senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFS) are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations of linker histone H1 and linker DNA-binding proteins. SAHFS can be formed by a variety of cell types, but their mechanism of action remains unclear.', 'Senescent cells have a distinct gene expression profile, which is often accompanied by the spatial redistribution of heterochromatin into senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). Their creation goes through the senescence stimulated depletion of LMNB1, which   facilitates the nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers which characterize senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF).']

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000b	What is the association between h-index and academic rank in academic neurosurgery?	 The contemporary h-index was found to be significantly predictive of NIH funding (p<0.001).  Bibliometric indices are higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without, but only the contemporary h-index was shown to be predictive of NIH funding.  However, when stratified by academic rank, a trend was observed showing greater mean h-index scores for those who completed fellowships.  Overall, being a senior faculty member corresponds with a greater h-index score, regardless of whether a fellowship was completed. There was a positive association between the h-index, academic rank, and years posttraining. Application of the h-index as a bibliometric in neurosurgery can distinguish academic productivity on the basis of academic rank, years posttraining, and neurosurgical subspecialties.  Overall, the authors conclude that the h index metric is a reasonable measure of academic productivity in the pediatric neurosurgery arena that provides a robust measure of an individual's contribution to the pediatric neurosurgery literature.  The h index calculation also reveals the productivity of the pediatric neurosurgeons to be on par with the productivity of neurosurgeons in general. The h-index frequency distribution conformed to both the log-linear variation of a power law (r                         (2) = .99) and the beta distribution with the same fitting exponents as previously described in a power law analysis of the productivity of neurosurgeons.  The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors being 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis; all groups significantly different from each other except the difference between instructor and assistant professor [Conover]). Departmental chairs had a median h index of 22 (range 3-55) and program directors a median of 17 (range 0-62). Plot of the log of the rank versus h index demonstrated a remarkable linear pattern (R(2) = 0.995, p < 0.0001), suggesting that this is a power-law relationship. The distribution of the h index within an academic population is described for the first time and appears related to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. As expected, the h index increased with academic rank and there was a statistically significant difference between each rank.  Within the field of academic neurosurgery, clear differences of h indices between academic ranks exist. On average, an increase of the h index by 5 appears to correspond to the next highest academic rank, with the exception of chairperson. Scopus h-index was of borderline significance in predicting physician salary (P = 0.12). 	['Greater h-index is associated with greater academic rank in academic neurosurgery. The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors was shown to be 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively.

Acute intravenous administration of TRH to rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy caused a significant increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac contractility TRH can enhance cardiomyocyte contractility in vivo. TRH in the range of 0.1-10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on cardiac contractility Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) improved mean arterial pressure (MAP) and myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax) TRH improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and hemodynamics Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) could improve mean arterial pressure (MAP), myocardial contractile parameters (+/- dp/dtmax, Vpm and Vmax) TRH increased the contractile force of muscles dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction TRH potentiated the response of contractile force to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration. TRH has a positive inotropic effect at least partly due to an increase in the slow inward Ca2+ current Thus, TRH improves cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and hemodynamics during hemorrhagic shock.

54dfce9b1388e8454a00000b	What is the mechanism by which HIV-1-encoded Vif protein allows virus replication?	A naturally occurring Vif mutant (I107T) attenuates anti-APOBEC3G activity and HIV-1 replication The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein counteracts the antiviral activity of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) family of proteins by targeting the proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway The host protein APOBEC3G (A3G) can limit HIV-1 replication. Its protective effect is overcome by the HIV-1 'viral infectivity factor' (Vif), which targets A3G for proteosomal degradation  Vif is thought to primarily overcome APOBEC3G through an interaction that mediates APOBEC3G ubiquitination and results in its proteasomal degradation However, Vif may also inhibit APOBEC3G mRNA translation, virion encapsidation, and deamination activity Vif counteracts the packaging of two cellular cytidine deaminases named APOBEC3G (A3G) and A3F by diverse mechanisms including the recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and the proteasomal degradation of A3G/A3F, the inhibition of A3G mRNA translation or by a direct competition mechanism In addition, Vif appears to be an active partner of the late steps of viral replication by participating in virus assembly and Gag processing, thus regulating the final stage of virion formation notably genomic RNA dimerization and by inhibiting the initiation of reverse transcription Human apoplipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3G (A3G) is an antiviral protein that blocks HIV-1 replication. However, the antiviral activity of A3G is overcome by the HIV-1 protein Vif. This inhibitory function of Vif is related to its ability to degrade A3G in the proteasome Polyubiquitination of APOBEC3G is essential for its degradation by HIV-1 Vif These data suggest that polyubiquitination of APOBEC3G, not that of HIV-1 Vif, is crucial for APOBEC3G degradation During coevolution with the host, HIV-1 developed the ability to hijack the cellular ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway to counteract the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (A3G), a host cytidine deaminase that can block HIV-1 replication. Abrogation of A3G function involves the HIV-1 Vif protein, which binds A3G and serves as an adapter molecule to recruit A3G to a Cullin5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex HIV-1 counteracts APOBEC3 proteins by encoding the viral protein Vif, which contains distinct domains that specifically interact with these APOBEC3 proteins to ensure their proteasomal degradation, allowing virus replication to proceed	['The HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts the antiviral activity of the APOBEC3 family by targeting the proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. More specifically, Vif, serving as a substrate receptor, facilitates ubiquitination of APOBEC3 proteins by forming a Cullin5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets APOBEC3 proteins for rapid proteasomal degradation.']

5c93ea7cecadf2e73f00001d	What are there sex differences in SAMHD1 activity?	Sex influences SAMHD1 activity and susceptibility to HIV-1 in primary human macrophages. Investigations into the mechanism governing these sex-dependent differences revealed that the host restriction factor SAMHD1 exists in a hyperphosphorylated, less active state in male-derived macrophages. In addition, the major kinase responsible for SAMHD1 phosphorylation, CDK1, exhibited lower levels of expression in female-derived macrophages in all tested donor pairs. The sex-dependent differences in viral restriction imposed by SAMHD1 were abrogated upon its depletion. We conclude that SAMHD1 is an essential modulator of infectivity in a sex-dependent manner in macrophages, constituting a novel component of sex differences in innate immune control of HIV-1.

Ohnologs -paralogous gene pairs generated by whole genome duplication- are enriched for dosage sensitive genes, that is, genes that have a phenotype due to copy number changes Ohnologs are paralogs stemming from such genome duplication events, and some zebrafish genes said to be "novel" are more appropriately interpreted as "ohnologs gone missing", cases in which ohnologs are preserved differentially in different evolutionary lineages. Copy number variations are distributed non-randomly in vertebrate genomes, and it was recently reported that ohnologs, which are duplicated genes derived from whole genome duplication, are refractory to copy number variations.

588fa24fed9bbee70d000005	Describe the mechanism of action of Bezlotoxumab?	Bezlotoxumab (Zinplava™) is a human monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B developed by Merck&Co.  Circulating neutralizing antitoxin antibodies are protective in C. difficile infection (CDI), as demonstrated, in part, by the protective effects of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, which bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the cytotoxic/cytopathic effects of TcdA and TcdB, respectively.  We compared the bezlotoxumab epitopes in the TcdB receptor binding domain across known TcdB sequences and found that key substitutions within the bezlotoxumab epitopes correlated with the relative differences in potencies of bezlotoxumab against TcdB of some strains, including ribotypes 027 and 078. Mechanism of action and epitopes of Clostridium difficile toxin B-neutralizing antibody bezlotoxumab revealed by X-ray crystallography. A combination of the anti-TcdA antibody actoxumab and the anti-TcdB antibody bezlotoxumab is currently under development for the prevention of recurrent C. difficile infections. We demonstrate here through various biophysical approaches that bezlotoxumab binds to specific regions within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain.  We also show that bezlotoxumab neutralizes TcdB by blocking binding of TcdB to mammalian cells. Overall, our data are consistent with a model wherein a single molecule of bezlotoxumab neutralizes TcdB by binding via its two Fab regions to two epitopes within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain, partially blocking the carbohydrate binding pockets of the toxin and preventing toxin binding to host cells. We compared the bezlotoxumab epitopes in the TcdB receptor binding domain across known TcdB sequences and found that key substitutions within the bezlotoxumab epitopes correlated with the relative differences in potencies of bezlotoxumab against TcdB of some strains, including ribotypes 027 and 078. We also show that bezlotoxumab neutralizes TcdB by blocking binding of TcdB to mammalian cells. Bezlotoxumab (Zinplava™) is a human monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B developed by Merck & Co. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the cytotoxic/cytopathic effects of TcdA and TcdB, respectively. The monoclonal antitoxin antibodies actoxumab (anti-TcdA) and bezlotoxumab (anti-TcdB) are currently in development for the prevention of recurrent CDI. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics Circulating neutralizing antitoxin antibodies are protective in C. difficile infection (CDI), as demonstrated, in part, by the protective effects of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, which bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively We demonstrate here through various biophysical approaches that bezlotoxumab binds to specific regions within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain. Based on this information, we solved the x-ray structure of the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain bound to Fab fragments of bezlotoxumab. The structure reveals that the TcdB CROP domain adopts a β-solenoid fold consisting of long and short repeats and that bezlotoxumab binds to two homologous sites within the CROP domain, partially occluding two of the four putative carbohydrate binding pockets located in TcdB. Overall, our data are consistent with a model wherein a single molecule of bezlotoxumab neutralizes TcdB by binding via its two Fab regions to two epitopes within the N-terminal half of the TcdB CROP domain, partially blocking the carbohydrate binding pockets of the toxin and preventing toxin binding to host cells. <CopyrightInformation>© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C Mechanism of action and epitopes of Clostridium difficile toxin B-neutralizing antibody bezlotoxumab revealed by X-ray crystallography.

606b3ce794d57fd879000065	What is the "flight-or-fight response"?	Although the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in mediating the flight-or-fight response was recognized decades ago, the crucial role of peripheral innervation in regulating cell behavior and response to the microenvironment has only recently emerged.   Beyond the "flight-or-fight" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body ("allostatic load").  The fear, flight or fight response serves as the fundamental physiological basis for examining an organism's awareness of its environment under an impending predator attack.  The cAMP intracellular signaling pathway is an important system for signal transmission responsible for the ancestral 'flight or fight' response and involved in the control of critical functions including frequency and strength of heart contraction, energy metabolism and gene transcription. 	['This is also known as " flight-or- fight response" and is defined as an individual\'s response to a stimulus such as stress, that includes loss of sleep, anxiety, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain.', "The cAMP intracellular signaling pathway is an important system for signal transmission responsible for the ancestral 'flight or fight' response and involved in the control of critical functions including frequency and strength of heart contraction, energy metabolism and gene transcription."]

5710eec5a5ed216440000004	How does Hst5 (histatin 5) affect infections by Candida glabrata?	Human salivary histatins, including histatin 5 (Hst 5), are small cationic proteins that are the major source of fungicidal activity of saliva Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant. Since Hst 5 requires fungal binding to cell wall components prior to intracellular translocation, reduced Hst 5 binding to C. glabrata may be the reason for its insensitivity. Hst 5 enters C. albicans cell through polyamine transporters Dur3p and Dur31p that are uncharacterized in C. glabrata.  the crucial rate limiting step is reduced uptake that can be overcome by expression of C. albicans Dur proteins in C. glabrata. Histatin 5, a human salivary protein with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, is remarkably ineffective against Candida glabrata. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that histatin-5 possessed the fungicidal activity against Candida species other than C. glabrata. The present study shows that a number of basic antifungal peptides, including human salivary histatin 5, a designed histatin analog designated dhvar4, and a peptide from frog skin, PGLa, are active against amphotericin B-resistant Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Aspergillus fumigatus strains and against a fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata isolate. In addition, we tested azole-resistant C. albicans and Candida glabrata strains for their susceptibilities to Hsn-5. Assessment of the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5 with the well-characterized azole-resistant strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata, however, suggested that the mode of action of histatins against Candida is distinct from that of azole-based antifungal agents because Hsn-5 kills both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains equally well. Histatin 5 resistance of Candida glabrata can be reversed by insertion of Candida albicans polyamine transporter-encoding genes DUR3 and DUR31. Roles of cellular respiration, CgCDR1, and CgCDR2 in Candida glabrata resistance to histatin 5. Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant.  Biofilms of C. glabrata GDH1407 and 6115/06 were less susceptible to histatin 5, with 50% RMA of 31.2 +/- 4.8 and 62.5 +/- 0.7 microM, respectively.  Thus, neither C. glabrata cell surface or biofilm matrix β-1,3-glucan levels affected Hst 5 toxicity; rather the crucial rate limiting step is reduced uptake that can be overcome by expression of C. albicans Dur proteins in C. glabrata. These results indicate that histatin 5 exhibits antifungal activity against biofilms of C. albicans and C. glabrata developed on denture acrylic.  Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are predominant fungi associated with oral candidiasis.  C. glabrata is significantly less sensitive to histatin 5 than C. albicans. We investigated whether the distinct resistance of C. glabrata to histatin 5 is related to similar mechanisms. The authors report a case of disseminated candidiasis due to Candida glabrata with liver metastases. We examined antifungal activities of histatin 5 against planktonic or biofilm Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.

5539062dbc4f83e828000013	What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?	Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Aberrant patterns of H3K4 and H3K27 histone lysine methylation occur across subgroups in medulloblastoma. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors.	['Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.']

Compound 12c showed potent and prolonged LH suppression after a single dose was orally administered in castrated monkeys compared to a known antagonist, Elagolix.  INTRODUCTION: Elagolix is a novel, orally active, non-peptide, competitive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist in development for the management of endometriosis with associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix, an oral, nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, over 12 months in women with endometriosis-associated pain. Phase III trials on elagolix, a new oral GnRH antagonist but non-inferiority RCT data are required to compare elagolix with first-line therapies for endometriosis. Elagolix (ORILISSA™), an orally bioavailable, second-generation, non-peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is being developed AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences for the treatment of reproductive hormone-dependent disorders in women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate elagolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, alone or with add-back therapy, in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding (greater than 80 mL per month) associated with uterine leiomyomas. Research development of a new GnRH antagonist (Elagolix) for the treatment of endometriosis: a review of the literature.

Context: Elagolix is a nonpeptide, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist being developed for sex-hormone-dependent diseases in women.Objective: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of elagolix.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study in 45 healthy premenopausal women at a research unit.Interventions: Elagolix [150 mg once daily or 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg twice daily (BID)] or placebo was administered for 21 days.Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures were elagolix pharmacokinetics, suppression of gonadotropics [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH)] and ovarian hormones [estradiol (E2), progesterone (P)], and adverse events.Results: Elagolix was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, reaching maximum concentrations at 1.0 to 1.5 hours, with a half-life of 4 to 6 hours. Elagolix, an oral GnRH antagonist, versus subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for the treatment of endometriosis: effects on bone mineral density. While elagolix may have an advantage over established GnRH agonists, in that it does not lead to a 'flare-up' effect, it too, takes a toll on bone mineral density.

532f0511d6d3ac6a34000024	What is the effect of ivabradine in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction?	Traditional agents with strong evidence in HFrEF have proved unsuccessful in HFpEF. Newer agents such as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, sildenafil, and ivabradine have demonstrated benefits without improving mortality. In db/db, a model of HFPEF, selective HR reduction by If-inhibition improved vascular stiffness, LV contractility, and diastolic function. Therefore, If-inhibition might be a therapeutic concept for HFPEF, if confirmed in humans. Selective HR reduction with IVA reduces DD and cardiac fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. These beneficial effects of IVA support testing pure HR reduction in patients with diastolic heart failure. Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well. In patients with HFpEF, short-term treatment with ivabradine increased exercise capacity, with a contribution from improved left ventricular filling pressure response to exercise as reflected by the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity.

The increasing availability of resequencing data has led to a better understanding of the most important genes in cancer development. Nevertheless, the mutational landscape of many tumor types is heterogeneous and encompasses a long tail of potential driver genes that are systematically excluded by currently available methods due to the low frequency of their mutations.

Exon skipping is a therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that has been in development for close to two decades. This approach uses antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modulate pre-mRNA splicing of dystrophin transcripts to restore the disrupted DMD reading frame.  By the method of exon skipping in dystrophin pre-mRNA the reading frame is restored and the internally deleted but functional dystrophin is produced.  s, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, enabled dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 51.  Restoration of the open reading frame of the DMD gene and dystrophin protein production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be achieved by exon skipping using antisense oligomers (AOs) targeted to splicing elements.  We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. AVI-4658 is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) designed to induce skipping of dystrophin exon 51 and restore its expression in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

5a855585faa1ab7d2e000029	What is the origin of XUT transcripts in yeast?	XUTs are a class of Xrn1-sensitive antisense regulatory non-coding RNA in yeast Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions.  Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases.  Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated, locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Strikingly, antisense transcription was detected for most protein-coding genes, correlating with low sense transcription, especially when overlapping the mRNA start site. RNA profiling revealed that the resulting aslncRNAs mainly correspond to cryptic Xrn1/Exo2-sensitive transcripts (XUTs) Finally, we showed that asXUTs are controlled by the histone chaperone Spt6 and respond to meiosis induction, in both cases anti-correlating with levels of the paired-sense mRNAs, supporting physiological significance to antisense-mediated gene attenuation. Our work highlights that antisense transcription is much more extended than anticipated and might constitute an additional non-promoter determinant of gene regulation complexity. Antisense long non-coding (aslnc)RNAs represent a substantial part of eukaryotic transcriptomes that are, in yeast, controlled by the Xrn1 exonuclease. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases. Single-gene investigation, genome-wide RNA analyses, and double-stranded (ds)RNA mapping revealed that 3'-ss extensions discriminate the NMD-targeted XUTs from stable lncRNAs. Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated, locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Indeed, expression of anticomplementary transcripts protects cryptic intergenic lncRNAs from NMD. Our results indicate that aslncRNAs form dsRNA that are only translated and targeted to NMD if dissociated by Mtr4 and Dbp2. We propose that NMD buffers genome expression by discarding pervasive regulatory transcripts. Notably, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. XUTs are a class of Xrn1-sensitive antisense regulatory non-coding RNA in yeast. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear.

5fdb8309a43ad3127800002f	What is the function of emergency granulopoiesis?	During 'emergency' situations such as infections, host defense requires rapid mobilization of bone marrow granulocyte progenitors These data suggest a critical function for C/EBPbeta in emergency granulopoiesis, which demands both differentiation and proliferation of granulocyte precursors. Emergency granulopoiesis promotes neutrophil-dendritic cell encounters that prevent mouse lung allograft acceptance Our findings identify granulopoiesis-mediated augmentation of alloimmunity as a novel link between innate and adaptive immune responses after organ transplantation. Granulopoiesis is tightly regulated to meet host demands during both "steady-state" and "emergency" situations, such as infections After the induction of candidemia, rapid mobilization of mature granulocytes and an increase in early granulocyte precursors accompanied by cell cycle acceleration was followed by a gradual increase in granulocytes originating from the immature populations Emergency granulopoiesis is a component of the innate immune response that is induced in response to infectious or inflammatory challenge. Failed emergency granulopoiesis in Fancc(-/-) mice was associated with excess apoptosis of HSCs and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and impaired HSC function. Systemic bacterial infection induces a hematopoietic response program termed "emergency granulopoiesis" that is characterized by increased de novo bone marrow (BM) neutrophil production Our studies demonstrate a previously undescribed role for HoxA10 in terminating emergency granulopoiesis, suggesting an important contribution by Hox proteins to the innate immune response. However, if microbial infection cannot be controlled locally, and consequently develops into a life-threatening condition, neutrophils are used up in large quantities and the haematopoietic system has to rapidly adapt to the increased demand by switching from steady-state to emergency granulopoiesis. This involves the markedly increased de novo production of neutrophils, which results from enhanced myeloid precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow Emergency granulopoiesis refers to the increased production of neutrophils in bone marrow and their release into circulation induced by severe infection. Emergency granulopoiesis is a very important strategy to supply efficient neutrophil number in response to infection. We previously showed that C/EBPβ, which is a transcription factor required for emergency granulopoiesis, plays a pivotal role at the level of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells under stress conditions.  In fact, emergency granulopoiesis (EG), a process regulating neutrophil homeostasis in inflammatory conditions and infections, may occur improperly in leukemic conditions, leading to reduced neutrophil counts. Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (Icsbp) is required for terminating emergency granulopoiesis, an episodic event responsible for granulocyte production in response to infections and a key component of the innate immune response Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mediates "emergency" granulopoiesis during infection, a process that is mimicked by clinical G-CSF use, yet we understand little about the intracellular signaling cascades that control demand-driven neutrophil production. In addition, embryos, where pax9 was functionally disrupted by injecting morpholinos, failed to increase the number of neutrophils in response to pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that Pax9 is not only essential for developmental granulopoiesis but also emergency granulopoiesis. Emergency granulopoiesis is a hematopoietic program of stem cell-driven neutrophil production used to counteract immune cell exhaustion following infection. Infections and inflammation trigger neutrophilias that are supported by a hematopoietic program of accelerated granulopoiesis known as emergency granulopoiesis Emergency granulopoiesis is the enhanced production of neutrophils by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) upon infection and is widely considered a homoeostatic mechanism for replacing exhausted leukocytes. We show that stem cell-driven neutrophil production occurs in response to Shigella infection and requires macrophage-independent signaling by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Gcsf). Emergency granulopoiesis promotes neutrophil-dendritic cell encounters that prevent mouse lung allograft acceptance.

56c1d85fef6e394741000036	What is known about maternal smoking and brain tumor risk?	BACKGROUND: A recent meta-analysis suggested an association between exposure to paternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood brain tumor risk, but no studies have evaluated whether this association differs by polymorphisms in genes that metabolize tobacco-smoke chemicals. OBJECTIVE: Studies of the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on development of brain tumors in the offspring generally have found no increase in risk but most have mainly relied on retrospective exposure assessment.  Children of women who smoked during pregnancy had an increased incidence of brain tumors (hazard ratio = 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.53). The increase in risk was similar for benign and malignant tumors, and was most apparent for astrocytoma.  CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for maternal smoking during pregnancy in the etiology of childhood brain tumors. Maternal occupational exposure to PAH before conception or during pregnancy was rare, and this exposure was not associated with any type of childhood brain tumor.  There was no association between the risk of brain tumors in the child and parental smoking prior to pregnancy, maternal smoking or regular exposure to others' cigarette smoke during pregnancy at home or at work, or passive smoking by the child during the first year of life. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of childhood brain tumors: a meta-analysis of 6566 subjects from twelve epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVE: Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors. Pooling all twelve reports yielded an RRs of 1.05 (0.90-1.21), a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development. .CONCLUSION: The available epidemiological data do not support a clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and pediatric brain tumor development.  We observed only few positive associations, namely, between CNS tumors and low birth weight [<2,500 g; odds ratio (OR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-2.84], between ependymoma and maternal smoking during pregnancy (>10 cigarettes per day: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.69-13.1), and between astrocytoma and exposure to wood preservatives (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-3.01).  The results on exposure to paternal tobacco smoke suggest an association with brain tumors (RR 1.22; CI, 1.05-1. 40; based on 10 studies) and lymphomas (RR 2.08; CI, 1.08-3.98; 4 studies).  No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.3]. A slightly increased OR for CBTs was found for paternal smoking during pregnancy in the absence of maternal smoking (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.90-1.5) and for maternal exposure to passive smoke from any source (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.95-1.6). The results of this analysis are consistent with results from several prior epidemiological studies that showed no significant association between CBTs and maternal smoking before or during pregnancy or maternal exposure to passive smoke during pregnancy. No significant differences in risks were found to be associated with maternal or paternal smoking at any time (odds ratio (OR) = 0.92 for mothers and 1.06 for fathers), during the year of birth of the child (which included both the prenatal and postnatal periods) (ORs = 0.84 for<1 pack/day and 1.0 for>or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.68 for<1 pack/day and 1.07 for>or = 1 pack/day for fathers), or 2 years before the child was born, i.e., the pre-conception period (ORs = 0.75 for<1 pack/day and 1.01 for>or = 1 pack/day for mothers, and 0.90 for<1 pack/day and 1.15 for>or = 1 pack/day for fathers). Mothers were also specifically asked if they smoked during the pregnancy, and no association was found compared with never smokers (OR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.45) or for ever-smokers who continued to smoke during pregnancy compared with those who stopped smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.75-1.78).  The lack of an effect of parental smoking was observed for both the major histologic types and locations of brain tumors. These findings and those from earlier studies provide no support for the hypothesis that parental cigarette smoking influences the risk of brain tumors in children. Increased risk was associated with maternal contact with nitrosamine-containing substances such as burning incense (odds ratio, 3.3; p = 0.005), sidestream cigarette smoke (odds ratio, 1.5; p = 0.03), and face makeup (odds ratio, 1.6; p = 0.02); with maternal use of diuretics (odds ratio, 2.0; p = 0.03) and antihistamines (odds ratio, 3.4; p = 0.002); and with the level of maternal consumption of cured meats (p = 0.008). Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors. Studies of the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on development of brain tumors in the offspring generally have found no increase in risk but most have mainly relied on retrospective exposure assessment. No association was found between the risk of CBTs and maternal or paternal smoking before pregnancy and there was no association between CBTs and maternal smoking during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.3]. There was no association between the risk of brain tumors in the child and parental smoking prior to pregnancy, maternal smoking or regular exposure to others' cigarette smoke during pregnancy at home or at work, or passive smoking by the child during the first year of life. RESULTS: We found positive interaction odds ratios (ORs) for both maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy, EPHX1 H139R, and childhood brain tumors (P(interaction) = 0.02; 0.10), such that children with the high-risk (greater PAH activation) genotype were at a higher risk of brain tumors relative to children with the low-risk genotype when exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy.  Finally, no significant increase in risk of brain tumors was found for the child's passive exposure to parental smoking during the period from birth to diagnosis of the brain tumor in the case. Prior epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumors. a non-statistically significant result suggesting no clear association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of childhood brain tumor development.

Nine patients reported clinically significant bleeding, and seven had intestinal angiodysplasia and transfusion-dependent gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde syndrome), with the median number of transfusions required being 20 (IQR 10-33; range 4-50).

To this end, we performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of HEK-293 cells on samples with lowered activity of candidate RNA editing enzymes.

54d8efb84b1fd0d33c000003	What are the main characteristics/symptoms of the "Brugada" syndrome	In 1992, Brugada and Brugada first described a new entity, which became known as Brugada syndrome, that is associated with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients without structural heart disease. This syndrome is characterized by a distinct electrocardiographic phenotype, type 1 Brugada pattern, consisting of a coved ST-segment elevation (≥0.2 mV) followed by a negative T wave in more than one right precordial lead. Brugada syndrome predisposes individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, in the absence of structural heart disease. The typical Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) phenotype is often concealed in affected population Brugada syndrome is a rare cardiac arrhythmia characterized by electrocardiographic right bundle branch block and persistent ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. Brugada syndrome is a genetically determined familial disease with autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance, conferring a predisposition to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Brugada syndrome (BrS)  BrS is considered to be a primary inherited channelopathy often involving the inward sodium current and the diagnosis has traditionally required the exclusion of overt structural heart disease.  Brugada syndrome (BrS) primarily associates with the loss of sodium channel function. PKP2 mutations may be a molecular substrate leading to the diagnosis of BrS. Brugada syndrome is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome predisposing to sudden cardiac death.  the first mutations in SCN5A encoding the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 were reported. Brugada syndrome is characterized by typical ECG features, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), more frequent during nighttime. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by ST segment elevation in V1-V3 ECG leads. Mutations SCN5A gene encoding for the cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channel are found in some BrS patients, but also in family members with isolated conduction disturbances. Brugada syndrome (BrS), one of the most frequently diagnosed inherited arrhythmogenic syndromes, is responsible for more than 4% of all sudden deaths and at least 20% of sudden deaths in patients with structurally normal hearts. Brugada syndrome is a major cause of sudden death in young adults. Brugada's syndrome is one of the main causes of sudden death in young adults without a structural heart disease The Brugada syndrome is a clinical-electrocardiographic diagnosis characterized by syncopal episodes or sudden death (caused by ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) in patients with a structurally normal heart with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern consisting of ST segment elevation in precordial leads (Vl-V3) and a morphology of the QRS complex resembling right bundle branch block (the latter can transiently disappear). Timely diagnosis and adequate treatment may essentially decrease mortality of this disease. Brugada syndrome In 1992 we described a new syndrome consisting of syncopal episodes and/or sudden death in patients with a structurally normal heart and a characteristic electrocardiogram displaying a pattern resembling right bundle branch block with an ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3. In 1998 it was described that the disease is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Three different mutations have been identified. All three mutations affect the structure and the function of the sodium channel SCN5A. The diagnosis is easily made by means of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The presence of concealed and intermittent forms, however, makes the diagnosis difficult in some patients. The Brugada syndrome is a clinical-electrocardiographic diagnosis characterised by syncopal or sudden death episodes in patients with a structurally normal heart with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern consisting of ST segment elevation in the precordial leads V1 to V3 and a morphology of the QRS complex resembling a right bundle branch block. In many patients with the Brugada syndrome, the electrocardiographic manifestations transiently normalize; leading to underdiagnosis of the syndrome.  The incidence of sudden death in this syndrome is very high and can only be prevented by implanting a cardioverter-defibrillator.

Brugada syndrome is a genetically determined familial disease with autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance, conferring a predisposition to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. Brugada syndrome (BrS)is considered to be a primary inherited channelopathy often involving the inward sodium current and the diagnosis has traditionally required the exclusion of overt structural heart disease. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by ST segment elevation in V1-V3 ECG leads. Mutations SCN5A gene encoding for the cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channel are found in some BrS patients, but also in family members with isolated conduction disturbances.']

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 and Clusterin (CLU) C alleles are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and episodic memory (EM) decline. Memory resilience occurs when genetically at-risk adults perform at high and sustained levels. some 30 to 50% of older individuals who harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia.  Participants with normal cognition (n = 297) and mild cognitive impairment (n = 432) were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Resilience metrics were defined at baseline by examining the residuals when regressing brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume and cognition) on CSF biomarkers. A positive residual reflected better outcomes than expected for a given level of pathology (high resilience). Residuals were integrated into a latent variable model of resilience and validated by testing their ability to independently predict diagnostic conversion, cognitive decline, and the rate of ventricular dilation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia in elder populations with approximately 30 million cases worldwide. Genome wide genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease.

52f3a9ef2059c6d71c000012	what is the role of FGF-2 in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?	To investigate whether transmyocardial drilling revascularization combined with heparinized basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-incorporating degradable stent implantation (TMDRSI) can promote myocardial regeneration after acute myocardial infarction The new method has shown to be capable of promoting CSCs proliferation and differentiation into cardiomyocytes through activating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, while inhibiting myocardial apoptosis, thereby enhancing myocardial regeneration following AMI and improving cardiac function. This may provide a new strategy for myocardial regeneration following AMI. To investigate the effects of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on myocardial regeneration after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Exogenous bFGF was shown to have increased angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion, promoted myocardial regeneration by activating the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis, and thereby improved the cardiac function, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for AMI. Support to the paracrine hypothesis is provided by data showing that several genes, coding for factors (VEGF, FGF-2, HGF, IGF-I, and TB4) that are potential mediators of the effects exerted by the Akt-MSC conditioned medium, are significantly up-regulated in the Akt-MSCs, particularly in response to hypoxia. Taken together, our data support Akt-MSC-mediated paracrine mechanisms of myocardial protection and functional improvement. Prevascularization with basic fibroblast growth factor-incorporated microspheres enhances the benefits of cardiomyocyte transplantation. We expect that this system will contribute to regeneration medicine through its extensive application to other growth factors.

515ac941d24251bc050000ab	How does thyroid hormone regulate mitochondrial biogenesis in the myocardium?	L-T3 significantly increased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and biogenesis, such as hypoxic inducible factor-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, in the LV peri-infarct zone the T(3)-induced phosphorylation of p38 and AMPK in both slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscles suggests that these events may be important in mediating hormone-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4 The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4 T3 mediates an early stimulation of enzymes containing mtDNA encoded subunits (e.g. complex IV and V) in contrast to a different regulatory pattern for the entirely nuclear-encoded enzymes Activity of respiratory complexes II, IV, V and citrate synthase (CS), levels of mitochondrial enzyme subunits (e.g. COXI, COXIV) and nuclear-encoded transcription factors, involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. PGC-1, mtTFA and PPAR-alpha), were significantly elevated with 72 h T3 treatment T(3) increased PGC-1alpha content similarly in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle, as well as in the liver, but not in heart. Thyroid hormone [3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T(3))] induces phenotypic alterations in cardiac mitochondria, in part by influencing protein import and the expression of the import motor mitochondrial heat shock protein (mtHsp70). These findings indicate that import machinery components are differentially regulated in response to stimuli that induce mitochondrial biogenesis, like T(3) and differentiation. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle The contribution of TFAM, TFB2M, and helicase Twinkle in thyroid-induced mtDNA biogenesis was assessed. The activation of TFAM and TFB2M expression is shown to be required for the induction of mtDNA biogenesis. The role of helicase Twinkle, the expression induction of which is also observed after triiodothyronine addition, remains unclear. The analysis of factors that activate TFAM and TFB2M expression showed that NRF-1 is the determinative regulator: in rat cerebellum show that hypothyroidism causes reduction in expression of nuclear encoded genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis like PGC-1alpha, NRF-1alpha and Tfam These results thus indicate an integrated nuclear-mitochondrial cross talk in regulation of mitochondrial transcription by TH during brain development. T(3) acts to reduce cellular oxidative stress, which may help attenuate ROS-mediated damage, along with improving mitochondrial function and energy status in cells with mtDNA defects. These findings suggest the existence of compensatory mechanisms operating at the translational and/or post-translational levels which promote proliferation of mitochondria in the hypothyroid liver. However, when the liver mass was considered, hypothyroidism significantly reduced overall mitochondrial proliferation in rat liver. Total liver mitochondrial DNA levels in thyroid-treated animals were greater than age-paired controls by 79% at 7 days but only 67% at 14 days since a small gain occurred in control animals and no further increase occurred in treated rats during the second week. thyroid hormone treatment produces hyperplasia and an increase in mitochondrial number and mass in rat liver It is concluded that T3 exerts a direct, rather than permissive, effect on mitochondrial biogenesis, and that high affinity binding sites for GH are not present in rat liver mitochondria. These data strengthen the view that thyroid hormone regulates synthesis of specific components within each respiratory-chain complex and that these products apparently play key roles in inner-membrane biogenesis and assembly It is concluded that thyroid hormone causes an increase in the mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial cytochrome content, and respiratory rate, and consequently expands the capacity of oxidative metabolism without an uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation.	['T4 increases myocardial mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. The marked, parallel increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.

In an effort to better understand the molecular drivers of synaptic and neurophysiologic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we analyzed neuronal gene expression data from human AD brain tissue to identify master regulators of synaptic gene expression.Results: Master regulator analysis identifies ZCCHC17 as normally supporting the expression of a network of synaptic genes, and predicts that ZCCHC17 dysfunction in AD leads to lower expression of these genes. We demonstrate that ZCCHC17 is normally expressed in neurons and is reduced early in the course of AD pathology. We show that ZCCHC17 loss in rat neurons leads to lower expression of the majority of the predicted synaptic targets and that ZCCHC17 drives the expression of a similar gene network in humans and rats. These findings support a conserved function for ZCCHC17 between species and identify ZCCHC17 loss as an important early driver of lower synaptic gene expression in AD.

5710a51bcf1c325851000029	What is the function of the AtxA pleiotropic regulator?	The atxA gene product activates transcription of the anthrax toxin genes and is essential for virulence. The atxA-null mutant is avirulent in mice These data suggest that the atxA gene product also regulates toxin gene expression during infection. Thus, we conclude that the pX01 influence on capsule synthesis is mediated by AtxA, the pXO1-encoded trans-activator of the toxin gene expression. atxA, the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively  Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. Our data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.  Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved in regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA are important for optimal toxin gene expression. Two regulatory genes, acpA and atxA, have been reported to control expression of the Bacillus anthracis capsule biosynthesis operon capBCAD The atxA gene is located on the virulence plasmid pXO1, while pXO2 carries acpA and the cap genes Dual promoters control expression of the Bacillus anthracis virulence factor AtxA. Here we report that transcription of the atxA gene occurs from two independent promoters, P1 (previously described by Dai et al. [Z. Dai, J. C. Sirard, M. Mock, and T. M. Koehler, Mol. Microbiol. 16:1171-1181, 1995]) and P2, whose transcription start sites are separated by 650 bp. AtxA controls the expression of more than a hundred genes belonging to all genetic elements, the chromosome and both virulence plasmids, including those encoding the major virulence factors. AtxA can activate or repress gene expression.  Here we employ 5' and 3' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the atxA control region to demonstrate that atxA transcription from the major start site P1 is dependent upon a consensus sequence for the housekeeping sigma factor SigA and an A+T-rich upstream element for RNA polymerase. We also show that an additional trans-acting protein(s) binds specifically to atxA promoter sequences located between -13 and +36 relative to P1 and negatively impacts transcription. Deletion of this region increases promoter activity up to 15-fold. A majority of genes on the virulence plasmid pXO1 that are regulated by the presence of either CO2 or AtxA separately are also regulated synergistically in the presence of both. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanism The majority of the regulated genes responded to both AtxA and carbon dioxide rather than to just one of these factors. Interestingly, we identified two previously unrecognized small RNAs that are highly expressed under physiological carbon dioxide concentrations in an AtxA-dependent manner This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. As a similar organization is found in transcription regulators in many other pathogens, AtxA might become the paradigm of a new class of virulence regulators. AtxA, a Bacillus anthracis global virulence regulator. Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling. The accumulation of the global virulence regulator AtxA protein was strongly reduced in the mutant strain. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.  Opposing effects of histidine phosphorylation regulate the AtxA virulence transcription factor in Bacillus anthracis. The B. anthracis pleiotropic regulator CodY activates toxin gene expression by post-translationally regulating the accumulation of the global regulator AtxA.  Cross-talk to the genes for Bacillus anthracis capsule synthesis by atxA, the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis. AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis.  Consistent with the role of atxA in virulence factor expression, a B. anthracis atxA-null mutant is avirulent in a murine model for anthrax.  This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. PlcR is the first example described of a pleiotropic regulator involved in the control of extracellular virulence factor expression in pathogenic Bacillus spp. Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling.

The AtxA virulence regulator of Bacillus anthracis is required for toxin and capsule gene expression. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes.

5c5866c086df2b9174000002	Describe clinical presentation of Escobar syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Escobar syndrome, a nonlethal variant of multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pterygia and multiple joint contractures along with other anomalies. It is generally characterized by multiple pterygia that are found in the cervical, antecubital and popliteal regions. In this report, we present the treatment management of a 14-year-old case with late stage Escobar syndrome who was admitted due to multiple pterygia and bilateral knee contractures. Escobar syndrome is a nonlethal subtype of multiple pterygium syndromes, characterized by webbing across the joints, congenital joint contracture, facial dysmorphism and a variety of other congenital anomalies. The Escobar variant of multiple pterygium syndrome (MPS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder which may lead to many serious or even lethal fetal abnormalities. MPS is characterized by pterygia, arthrogryposis (joint contractures), and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the case described below, increased fetal nuchal translucency was the first abnormality diagnosed already in the first trimester of pregnancy. Other symptoms of the disease were found during the second trimester of pregnancy using ultrasonography examination. Nonlethal multiple pterygium syndrome: Escobar syndrome. Escobar syndrome (ES) or multiple pterygia syndrome (MIM#265000) is an infrequent condition characterized by facial dysmorphism, multiple webbing (pterygia), congenital contractures (arthrogryposis) and other internal anomalies.  Escobar syndrome is characterized with multiple pterygia or webs of the skin and multiple congenital anomalies. Nonlethal Escobar is a rare disorder that is a variant of multiple pterygium syndromes. It is a form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita characterized by excessive webbing (pterygia), congenital contractures (arthrogryposis), and scoliosis.

58bcb83d02b8c6095300000f	What is Bartter syndrome?	All forms of Bartter syndrome are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism The mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the ClC-Kb chloride channel are responsible for Bartter syndrome type 3, one of the four variants of Bartter syndrome in the genetically based nomenclature. Bartter syndrome (BS) is a hereditary disease, with an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant mode of transmission. It is characterized by salt wasting hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic Bartter syndrome Type III is caused by genetic alterations in the chloride channel kidney B (CLCNKB) gene and often presents in the first 2 years of life, known as classic Bartter syndrome. Bartter syndrome encompasses a variety of inheritable renal tubular transport disorders characterized by hypokalemia and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Classic Bartter syndrome and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the defect occurs in the transport channels of the distal convoluted tubule. Bartter syndrome type III and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract: an antenatal presentation. Bartter's syndrome associated with hydramnios, prematurity, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. Bartter syndrome (BS) is a rare renal tubular disorder presenting with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which is classified into five types It has been described in patients with chronic diarrhoea, eating disorders, laxative abuse and primary hyperaldosteronism; also occasionally in Bartter syndrome (BS), in which severe hypokalaemia accompanies significant renal sodium and water losses, though rarely in Gitelman syndrome (GS), in which there is equally severe hypokalaemia, but only modest sodium losses.We hypothesized that hypokalaemic nephropathy may not be due to potassium depletion per se, but persistently elevated circulating levels of aldosterone, possibly with superimposed episodes of renal hypoperfusion.We searched UK and European data sets to retrospectively compare serum and urinary parameters in patients with GS and BS. Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be induced by diuretics or antibiotics lassic Bartter syndrome is a salt-wasting tubulopathy caused by mutations in the CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb) gene clinical features of two renal tubular disorders characterized by sodium and potassium wasting: Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome Bartter syndrome is an autosomic recessive disease characterized by severe polyuria and sodium renal loss The term "Bartter syndrome" encompasses a group of closely related inherited tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal nephron.   true Bartter's syndrome, diagnosed as a normotensive, hyperreninaemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal urine chloride excretion, low CH2O/(CH2O+CCl) ratio during maximal water diuresis and negative urine screen for diuretics Bartter's syndrome belongs to a group of hypokalemic renal channel diseases. Hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting in the absence of hypertension, moderate metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninism and hyperaldosteronism suggest the presence of Bartter's syndrome.  Inherited hypokalemic renal tubulopathies are differentiated into at least three clinical subtypes: (1) the Gitelman variant of Bartter syndrome (GS); (2) hyperprostaglandin E syndrome, the antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome (HPS/aBS); and (3) the classic Bartter syndrome (cBS).  Bartter syndrome, a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle.  Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Bartter's syndrome has been used to describe a spectrum of inherited renal tubular disorders with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and overlapping and additional clinical and biochemical features.  antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome is characterized by a history of polyhydramnios, premature birth, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, polyuria and renal Most patients with Bartter syndrome have defects in transporters in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, such as the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, NKCC2, or the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ROMK.  Gitelman's syndrome or familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia and Bartter syndrome share some common features but their prognosis is quite different. Bartter syndrome is a group of inherited, salt-losing tubulopathies presenting as hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with normotensive hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are two different genetic renal diseases, but are both characterised by hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis. Bartter's syndrome is characterised by multiple gene mutations (Na-K-2Cl cotransporter; K(+) channels renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK); Cl channels, chloride channel Kb (ClCNKb); regulatory protein Barttin; and Ca(2+) -sensing receptor, CaSR) at the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, 	['All forms of Bartter syndrome are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism', 'All forms of hereditary Bartter syndrome are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism.']
5a7341fe2dc08e987e000018	What is the link between lithium use during pregnancy and Ebstein anomaly?	There is a possibility that, in particular, lithium may be associated with the Ebstein anomaly but present evidence cannot definitely affirm or deny this association. A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly.  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.  No women who took lithium during pregnancy were found among four case-control studies of Ebstein's anomaly involving 25, 34, 59, and 89 affected children, respectively. In two cohort studies, risk ratios of 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 7.7) and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.4 to 6.8) for all congenital anomalies have been observed. [Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve following prenatal exposure to lithium]. An Ebstein's anomaly was diagnosed, with tricuspid valve insufficiency. Exposure to lithium in utero was established. Literature reports indicate an association between exposure to lithium in utero and cardiac anomalies, notably Ebstein's anomaly. Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorders, and teratogenic effects include cardiovascular abnormalities, notably Ebstein anomaly.  Some studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manio-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy.  Cross-sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested lithium during pregnancy. In one infant, Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve was identified. In the other infant cross-sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have Ebstein's anomaly.  It is thought that this malformation is due to a direct teratogenic effect of lithium on the atrioventricular junction. When lithium hurts: a look at Ebstein anomaly. Some studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manio-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy. The search terms were lithium, pregnancy, teratogen, abnormalities (drug induced), Ebstein's anomaly, and adverse effects.<br><b>DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS</b>: In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring. In-utero exposure to lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy might be associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, especially the rare Ebstein's anomaly. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring. BACKGROUND There has been concern that exposure to lithium early in pregnancy may be associated with a marked increase in the risk of Ebstein's anomaly (a right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defect) in infants and overall congenital cardiac defects, but data are conflicting and limited. CONCLUSIONS Maternal use of lithium during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly; the magnitude of this effect was smaller than had been previously postulated. Our data suggest that Ebstein's anomaly is associated with maternal mental health problems generally rather than lithium or benzodiazepines specifically; therefore, changing or stopping medications may not be preventative. A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly. Lithium exposure during the first trimester seems to increase the risk of congenital heart disease, especially Ebstein's anomaly. Reported neonatal problems with maternal lithium therapy include Ebstein's anomaly, poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypotonia and lethargy, hyperbilirubinemia, and large-for-gestational-age infants. All case control studies regarding Ebstein's anomaly were negative, and among 222 infants with Ebstein's anomaly and 44 with tricuspid atresia none of the mothers had taken lithium during pregnancy. 1 patient in the lithium group chose to terminate pregnancy after Ebstein's anomaly was detected by a prenatal echocardiogram. When lithium hurts: a look at Ebstein anomaly. Literature reports indicate an association between exposure to lithium in utero and cardiac anomalies, notably Ebstein's anomaly. In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.

Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid by NADPH Statins, which specifically inhibit HMG Co-A reductase, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis, are widely prescribed to reduce serum cholesterol and cardiac risk, OBJECTIVES: Statins are a lipid-lowering treatment, prescribed frequently to prevent cardiovascular events. The doctors' beliefs about statins' ability to prolong life were associated significantly with their willingness to initiate treatment.CONCLUSION: The overall results imply that doctors have varying and suboptimal understanding of the effect of statins. However, the meta-regression analysis indicated that age of study participants modified the association between statin use and cancer risk (P = .003).CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support a protective effect of statins against cancer. What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug. * Our data do not show any beneficial effect of statins in reducing disease inflammation in RA patients.AIM: To investigate the possible anti-inflammatory effect of statins in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.METHODS: We conducted a cohort study consisting of all patients with at least one claim for RA using LifeLink, a health insurance claims database. Statins are widely used in kidney transplant patients given their established benefits in the general population, however evidence favouring their use is lacking.To assess the benefits and harms of statin therapy on mortality and renal outcomes in kidney transplant recipients.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and hand searched reference lists of articles and scientific proceedings.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing statins with placebo, no treatment or other statins in kidney transplant recipients.Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data Thus, it is important to understand whether other signaling pathways that are involved in atherosclerosis could be targets of statins, and if so, whether individuals with "overactivity" of these pathways could benefit from statin therapy, regardless of serum cholesterol level.Statins inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for the function of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase (ROCK) pathway Evidence for statins in people who have had a kidney transplant were sparse and lower quality due to imprecise effect estimates and provided limited systematic evaluation of treatment harm.Statins may reduce cardiovascular events in kidney transplant recipients, although treatment effects are imprecise Statins decreased 24-hour urinary protein excretion (6 studies, 311 patients: MD -0.73 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.52), but there was no significant improvement in creatinine clearance - a surrogate marker of renal function (11 studies, 548 patients: MD 1.48 mL/min, 95% CI -2.32 to 5.28).The incidence of rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (well known complications of statins use), were not significantly different between patients receiving statins and placebo.Statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients who are not receiving renal replacement therapy. Statins are less cost-effective when obtained at average retail prices, particularly in patients at lower CVD risk.Although statins reduce absolute CVD risk in patients with CKD, the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, and competing risks associated with progressive CKD, partly offset these gains In this review, we debate the relative effect of statins in driving insulin resistance and the impairment of insulin secretion.Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature was retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts employing the key words "Statins", "Randomized Clinical Trial", "Insulin sensitivity", "Insulin resistance", "Insulin Secretion", "Diabetes Mellitus" alone and/or in combination.The weight of clinical evidence suggests a worsening effect of statins on insulin resistance and secretion, anyway basic science studies did not find a clear molecular explanation, providing conflicting evidence regarding both the beneficial and the adverse effects of statin therapy on insulin sensitivity. This study was undertaken to investigate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of statins that target the IFN response in PDCs.We isolated human blood PDCs by flow cytometry and examined the effects of simvastatin and pitavastatin on PDC activation, IFNalpha production, and intracellular signaling.Statins inhibited IFNalpha production profoundly and tumor necrosis factor alpha production modestly in human PDCs in response to Toll-like receptor ligands The earlier JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention) trial provided appealing evidence that the risk of venous thrombosis may be lowered by statins Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) decrease postoperative adhesions by increasing peritoneal fibrinolytic activity. Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce CD40 expression in human vascular cells. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) activate expression of PPARalpha/PPARgamma and ABCA1 in cultured gallbladder epithelial cells. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) might cause high elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CK) in patients with unnoticed hypothyroidism. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce hypertrophic scar formation in a rabbit ear wounding model. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, induce phosphorylation of Mdm2 and attenuate the p53 response to DNA damage. The target for statins, HMG-CoA reductase, is expressed in ductal carcinoma-in situ and may predict patient response to radiotherapy. Two meta-analyses have shown statins do not improve survival, whereas two others showed improved cardiac function and reduced inflammation in HF. It appears lipophilic statins produce better survival and other outcome benefits compared to hydrophilic statins. Statins are the current basis of lipid-lowering therapy, despite which may have limitations on efficacy and safety. In high risk patients who do not achieve current lipid goals, in those intolerant to statins or those with atherogenic dyslipidemia, it is possible combine two or more lipid lowering drugs, including statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, niacin and prescription omega-3 fatty acids.

However, for most of these combination therapies pivotal data on clinical outcomes are still lacking. Statins are the current basis of lipid-lowering therapy, despite which may have limitations on efficacy and safety. However, the findings of two large RCTs do not support the evidence provided by previous studies and suggest statins lack beneficial effects in HF. Subsequently, a number of nonrandomised studies have shown statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Statins have shown broad spectrum anti-cancer properties in laboratory studies. Statin-induced myopathy is an important cause of statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. These findings underscore the need to better define the pathophysiology of statin-induced myalgia and develop methodologies to guide treatment of statin-intolerant patients..

The data presented herein identify many noncoding sequence motifs conserved over 800 million years that may function as genetic control motifs essential to the developmental process by comparing conserved noncoding sequences upstream of these exons in different species, we were able to identify homology between some exons. Some alternative splicing variants are probably very ancient and were already coded for by the ancestral Hox gene cluster Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes the b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes Unexpectedly large number of conserved noncoding regions within the ancestral chordate Hox cluster We found that Hox intergenic regions are largely conserved between the two amphioxus species, especially in the case of genes located at the 3' of the cluster, a trend previously observed in vertebrates We further compared the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters, finding several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. This suggests that the regulation of Hox genes is highly conserved across chordates, consistent with the similar Hox expression patterns in vertebrates and amphioxus Highly conserved syntenic blocks at the vertebrate Hox loci and conserved regulatory elements within and outside Hox gene clusters A large number of CNS was identified within the Hox clusters and outside the Hox clusters spread over large regions. The CNS include previously characterized enhancers and overlap with the 5' global control regions of HoxA and HoxD clusters. Most of the CNS are likely to be control regions involved in the regulation of Hox and other genes in these loci. We propose that the regulatory elements spread across large regions on either side of Hox clusters are a major evolutionary constraint that has maintained the exceptionally long syntenic blocks at the HoxA and HoxD loci omparative sequence analysis between homologous human and mouse genomic sequence upstream of Hoxa13 revealed a remote 2.25-kb conserved noncoding sequence (mmA13CNS) within the fourth intron of the Hibadh gene. mmA13CNS shares a common 131-bp core identity within a conserved noncoding sequence upstream of Hoxd13, which is located within the previously identified distal limb enhancer critical region HoxA cluster noncoding sequences conserved between bichir and euteleosts indicate that novel cis-sequences were acquired in the stem actinopterygians and maintained after cluster duplication Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes.

We have generated a comprehensive database of conserved Hox noncoding sequences that include cartilaginous, lobe-finned, and ray-finned fishes (bichir and teleosts).

533c388dc45e133714000008	What is the principle of the PAR-CLIP methodology?	We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. To gain insight into the complexity of snoRNA processing and the functional relevance of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, we sequence long and short RNAs, small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 protein and RNA fragments obtained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins. A large amount of miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) have been identified by the crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and the photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) along with the next-generation sequencing (NGS) PAR-CLIP shows high efficiency of RNA co-immunoprecipitation, but it also lead to T to C conversion in miRNA-RNA-protein crosslinking regions A recent method, PAR-CLIP, uses photoreactive nucleosides to crosslink RBPs to target RNAs in cells prior to immunoprecipitation. In this article, we review crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods adapted for large-scale identification of target RNA-binding sites and the respective RNA recognition elements. CLIP methods have the potential to detect hundreds of thousands of binding sites in single experiments although the separation of signal from noise can be challenging. We focus on photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP, which relies on the intracellular incorporation of photoactivatable ribonucleoside analogs into nascent transcripts, and yields characteristic sequence changes upon crosslinking that facilitate the separation of signal from noise. Photo-Activatable Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (PAR-CLIP) method was recently developed for global identification of RNAs interacting with proteins. The strength of this versatile method results from induction of specific T to C transitions at sites of interaction. PAR-CLIP reveals a collection of RNAs bound to a protein whereas SILAC-based RNA pull-downs identify a group of proteins bound to an RNA.  Here we present a step-by-step protocol and guidelines for the computational analysis for the large-scale identification of miRNA target sites in cultured cells by photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of AGO proteins. In particular, PAR-CLIP utilizes a photoactivatable nucleoside for more efficient crosslinking. rosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) protocols have made it possible to identify transcriptome-wide RNA-protein interaction sites In this issue of Molecular Cell, Mukherjee et al. (2011) and Lebedeva et al. (2011) identify transcriptome-wide HuR-RNA interactions using PAR-CLIP, unveiling HuR's nuclear role in pre-mRNA processing. ross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is increasingly used to map transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. We developed a method for CLIP data analysis, and applied it to compare CLIP with photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) and to uncover how differences in cross-linking and ribonuclease digestion affect the identified sites. In order to increase the specificity and positional resolution, a strategy referred to as CLIP (UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) was introduced.

56ccae765795f9a73e000035	What is the relationship between TailorX and Oncotype?	The TAILORx trial uses the Oncotype DX recurrence score to assign estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), node-negative patients to chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone.  A cohort study was undertaken, including consecutive patients with early node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and May 2013, including a period of prospective clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualised Options for Treatment (TAILORx)) recruitment. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, tumour clinico-pathological features, Oncotype DX use and recurrence score and chemotherapy use.  Oncotype DX testing began on a trial basis in 2007 and until October 2011, only patients enrolled on TAILORx availed of genomic profiling. 479 consecutive patients were included in the study, of whom 241 (50%) underwent Oncotype DX testing, 97 as part of the TAILORx clinical trial. To evaluate the ability to guide treatment decisions in the group with a mid-range recurrence score, the North American Cooperative Groups developed the Trial Assessing IndiviuaLized Options for Treatment for breast cancer, a randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone on invasive disease-free survival-ductal carcinoma in situ (IDFS-DCIS) survival in women with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer with a recurrence score of 11-25. One of these tests, Oncotype DXtrade mark, is a diagnostic test comprised of a 21-gene assay applied to paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, which allows physicians to predict subgroups of hormone-receptor-positive, node-negative patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy alone or require adjuvant chemotherapy to attain the best survival outcome. We tested if Oncotype DX and TAILORx risk categories could be predicted by standard pathological features and protein markers corresponding to 10 genes in the assay (ER, PR, Ki67, HER2, BCL2, CD68, Aurora A kinase, survivin, cyclin B1 and BAG1) on 52 patients who enrolled on TAILORx The TAILORx trial uses the Oncotype DX recurrence score to assign estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), node-negative patients to chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone Prediction of Oncotype DX and TAILORx risk categories using histopathological and immunohistochemical markers by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis Each patient is stratified into a risk category based on a recurrence score (RS) and the TAILORx trial is determining the benefit of chemotherapy for patients with mid-range RSs.

5507fc114b2a315d41000003	What is the biological role of K-48 linked protein ubiquitination?	On the LCV, AnkB triggers docking of K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins that are degraded by the host proteasomes to elevate cellular levels of amino acids needed for intracellular proliferation.  Transcription and injection of ankB is triggered by attached extracellular bacteria followed by rapid farnesylation and anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane beneath bacterial attachment, where K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins are assembled and degraded by the proteasomes, leading to a rapid rise in the cellular levels of amino acids. Although it has been known for a long time that ubiquitylation has a major role in the activation and regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, recent studies have revealed that the picture is a lot more complex than originally thought. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins.  The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  Covalent and reversible post-translational modifications of proteins are a common theme in signaling. Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues. Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system. Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery	['The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.

Protection against infection and maintenance of homeostasis are the hallmarks of the innate immune system. The complex signaling cascades that occur following microbial infection have been studied intensely for a number of years and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) represent novel regulatory components of these pathways. Over the last decade, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a fundamental molecular class whose members play pivotal roles in the regulation of the genome. Through their numerous functions, lncRNAs play critical roles in the growth, development, senescence, death, and other important physiological and pathological processes. lncRNAs usually function through interactions with proteins, which implies the importance of identifying the binding proteins of lncRNAs in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of lncRNAs. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are involved in multiple processes critical to normal cellular function and dysfunction of lncRNA MIAT may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. lncRNAs function as adaptors that link specific chromatin loci with chromatin-remodeling complexes and transcription factors. The results indicate that lncRNA-CIR contributes to ECM degradation and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OA. We propose that lncRNA-CIR could be used as a potential target in OA therapy. Here, we report that lncRNA#32 is associated with type I IFN signaling. ur results reveal a role for lncRNA#32 in host antiviral responses.

5aad547efcf456587200000b	What is the "protein inference problem"?	 the protein inference problem still hampers the automatic assignment of peptide sequences to proteins, consequently impeding the quantification of sequence variants. the protein inference problem can be regarded as a special protein quantification problem in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins whose abundance values are not zero. Protein inference is an important issue in proteomics research. Its main objective is to select a proper subset of candidate proteins that best explain the observed peptides.  Assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is an important issue in shotgun proteomics. A major challenge in shotgun proteomics has been the assignment of identified peptides to the proteins from which they originate, referred to as the protein inference problem.

56e0813651531f7e33000010	What are viral vectors used for in optogenetics?	To express ChR in neurons, the common expression systems include viral vectors, in utero electroporation, and transgenic animals, each with their advantages and limitations regarding the cost, expression pattern, and the required effort.  In this review, the various strategies for selective genetic targeting of a defined neuronal population are discussed as well as the pros and cons of the use of transgenic animals and recombinant viral vectors for the expression of transgenes in a specific set of neurons. We demonstrate how the ability to target astrocytes with cell-specific viral vectors to express optogenetic constructs helped to unravel some previously unsuspected roles of these inconspicuous cells. Optogenetics, the use of light to stimulate or inhibit neural circuits via viral transduction of protein channels, has emerged as a possible method of treating epilepsy. We demonstrate how the ability to target astrocytes with cell-specific viral vectors to express optogenetic constructs helped to unravel some previously unsuspected roles of these inconspicuous cells. We conclude that a viral vector approach with a strong promoter is required for successful optogenetic stimulation of distal axons to evoke transmitter release in pre-autonomic PVN neurons. RESULTS: Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from infralimbic (IL) pyramidal cells, IL interneurons and prelimbic (PL) pyramidal cells 2-3 weeks after intra-IL injection of a viral vector encoding channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) under the control of the CaMKII promoter (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP) or a control vector that lacked the ChR2 sequence (rAAV5/CaMKIIa-EYFP).  We conclude that a viral vector approach with a strong promoter is required for successful optogenetic stimulation of distal axons to evoke transmitter release in pre-autonomic PVN neurons.  We selectively expressed ChR2(H134R) in rostral VLM catecholaminergic neurons by injecting Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vectors into the brain of adult dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH)(Cre/0) mice.  We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before.  We generated rabies glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that use a positive feedback loop composed of a Tet promoter driving both its own tetracycline-dependent transcription activator (tTA) ("TLoop") and channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2YFP).  Optogenetic control of cardiomyocytes via viral delivery. Here, we used an optogenetic approach, in which female rats received bilateral dorsal mPFC microinjections of viral constructs coding light-sensitive eNpHR3.0-eYFP or control eYFP protein and intracranial fiber optic implants.  We transduced rat LC neurons by direct injection of a lentiviral vector expressing channelrhodopsin2 under the control of the PRS promoter.  Here, we describe the construction of a blue-light-induced K(+) channel 1 (BLINK1) engineered by fusing the plant LOV2-J� photosensory module to the small viral K(+) channel Kcv.  In parallel, remarkable success in the development of highly efficient viral vectors for ocular gene therapy led to new strategies of using these novel optogenetic tools for vision restoration.  These recent findings show that novel optogenetic tools and viral vectors for ocular gene delivery are now available providing many opportunities to develop potential optogenetic strategies for vision restoration.

5a6f8dc6b750ff4455000058	Is trastuzumab associated cardiotoxicity reversible?	Although reduction of cardiac function by trastuzumab is mostly reversible, some patients, especially those with cardiac risk factors, may rarely experience chronic heart failure or prolonged left ventricular ejection fraction reduction.  We report the rare case of a metastatic breast cancer in a woman without cardiac risk factors who experienced long-term irreversible cardiotoxicity after discontinuation of trastuzumab therapy. Long-term irreversible trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity for metastatic breast cancer in a patient without cardiac risk factors. Similar to prior observations in breast cancer, TIC in gastric cancer patients is not frequent or reversible.  BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Cardiotoxicity is a potential adverse effect, manifesting as either an asymptomatic decline in left-ventricular ejection fraction or infrequently as largely reversible symptomatic heart failure (HF).  Furthermore, recent retrospective studies have shown an increased incidence of heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy in patients treated with trastuzumab, that can persist many years after the conclusion of the therapy, thus suggesting that the side toxic effects are not always reversible as it was initially proposed.  Trastuzumab-induced CT may be reversible.  BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, a HER2 monoclonal antibody, has transformed the prognosis of patients with the aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer type. Trastuzumab augments the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines, but its effect is thought to be at least partially reversible. CONCLUSIONS: LV dilation and subclinical impairment in cardiac function persists>2 years after the end of anthracycline and trastuzumab treatment, without significant recovery after trastuzumab cessation, suggestive of long-term underlying cardiac damage and remodeling. Because trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity is reversible, efforts to improve the adequacy of cardiac monitoring are needed, particularly in vulnerable populations. CONCLUSION: PHARE confirm that the incidence of cardiac end-points remains low and mostly reversible after trastuzumab.  Several breast cancer therapies can lead to cardiovascular toxicity: drugs such anthracyclines can cause permanent damage, anti-HER2 agents may cause transitory and reversible cardiac dysfunction and others, such as those used in endocrine therapy, primarily disturb lipid metabolism.  BACKGROUND: Although it is known that trastuzumab causes cardiotoxicity, its extent and reversibility are still in question. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity may induce reversible damage that is usually transitory and improves with trastuzumab withdrawal. The cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab also differs from traditional chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in that it appears to be at least partially reversible, not related to the cumulative dose, and re-challenge is generally tolerated. It is of note that the cardiotoxicity is generally reversible and can usually be managed with standard medical treatment. Although reversible in most cases, cardiotoxicity frequently results in the discontinuation of trastuzumab. The cardiac dysfunction associated with trastuzumab is most often reversible upon discontinuation of treatment and initiation of standard medical therapy for CHF. Two categories of cardiotoxic side effects of antineoplastic drugs have been previously proposed: Type I cardiotoxicity, defined as permanent cardiotoxicity, is usually caused by anthracyclines; Type II cardiotoxicity, considered as reversible cardiotoxicity, has been mainly related to monoclonal antibodies. The long-term significance of these events, isolating known cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines from those of trastuzumab, and the appropriateness of referring to trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity as reversible rather than responsive to trastuzumab withdrawal and heart failure medical therapy, are issues that continue to be debated. LVEF improved in most patients regardless of whether or not trastuzumab was continued.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Decreased LVEF while undergoing trastuzumab therapy occurs frequently and is usually reversible. Reversible cardiotoxicity in a 54-year-old woman treated with trastuzumab. Reversibility of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity: new insights based on clinical course and response to medical treatment. Type II cardiac changes occur in trastuzumab-treated patients, which do not appear to be dose-related, are not associated with histological changes, and are generally reversible.

Air is required for allele-specific silencing of the cis-linked Slc22a3, Slc22a2, and Igf2r genes in mouse placenta.

587f57f692a5b8ad44000002	Elaborate on the link between conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) and fractality.	Fractality and entropic scaling in the chromosomal distribution of conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. We explored the chromosomal distribution of different classes of CNEs in the human genome. We employed two methodologies: the scaling of block entropy and box-counting, with the aim to assess fractal characteristics of different CNE datasets. Both approaches converged to the conclusion that well-developed fractality is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution.  Conserved noncoding elements follow power-law-like distributions in several genomes as a result of genome dynamics. We find widespread power-law-like distributions, i.e. linearity in double logarithmic scale, in the inter-CNE distances, a feature which is connected with fractality and self-similarity.

5ace3e3f0340b9f058000012	What is the biological role of Neddylation?	Neddylation plays an important role in the regulation of murine and human dendritic cell function. Utilizing multiple but complementary approaches, we determined the role of an important but less understood type of PTM, namely, neddylation, in regulating DC functions. nhibition of neddylation suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines by DCs in response to Toll-like receptor, nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor, and noninfectious CD40L stimulation.  blocking neddylation could be a novel strategy for mitigating immune-mediated disease processes. Neddylation is a process that is similar to ubiquitination. It however has its own enzyme machinery. It is coupled to ubiquitination and is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis.  Proteins in the neddylation pathway have also been linked to regulating DDR. NEDDylation is a post-translational protein modification that is tightly linked to ubiquitination and thereby protein degradation. The neddylation conjugation pathway has a pivotal role in mediating ubiquitination of proteins and regulation of numerous biological processes. The present review describes the biological significance of NEDDylation for the novel identified substrates and the emerging evidence for the co-operation between the ubiquitin and NEDD8 pathways to control protein function. By altering the substrate's conformation, stability, subcellular localization or binding affinity to DNA or proteins, neddylation regulates diverse cellular processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated protein degradation, protein transcription, cell signaling etc. Similar to ubiquitination, neddylation is mediated by a cascade of three NEDD8 specific enzymes, an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme and one of the several E3 ligases. Neddylation is a post-translational protein modification that conjugates a ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins. Neddylation is commonly mediated by NEDD8-specific enzymes (typical neddylation) and, sometimes, by ubiquitin enzymes (atypical neddylation). The activity of cullin-RING type ubiquitination E3 ligases is regulated by neddylation, a process analogous to ubiquitination that culminates in covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to cullins. The Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) regulate homeostasis of ~20% of cellular proteins and their activation require neddylation of their cullin subunit. Protein neddylation, a newly characterized posttranslational modification that adds the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 to substrates, modulates important biological processes, whereas dysfunction of neddylation may cause several serious diseases, such as cancer. However, it is unknown whether and how UBE2F, a less characterized neddylation E2, regulates lung cancer cell survival, and whether and how NOXA, a proapoptotic protein, is ubiquitylated and degraded by which E3 and via which ubiquitin linkage.Experimental Design: Methods of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were utilized to examine UBE2F protein expression. Dysregulation in the ubiquitination and neddylation pathways is associated with many cancers. Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that controls diverse biological processes by covalently conjugating the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to specific targets. Ubiquitin can form diverse polyubiquitin chains, on its seven lysines, which play important functions in various biological processes.

532f06e6d6d3ac6a34000028	How does dabigatran therapy affect aPTT in patients with atrial fibrillation?	He had been started on dabigatran 150 mg twice a day about 4 months ago as an outpatient by his cardiologist. His prothrombin time (PT) was 63 seconds with international normalized ratio (INR) of 8.8 and his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 105.7 seconds.  The aPTT assay is relatively insensitive to dabigatran, and normal aPTT results may be observed even with therapeutic dabigatran concentrations. The APTT values became prolonged under dabigatran usage and exhibited a remarkable diversity. Although major bleeding did not occur unless APTT was prolonged excessively, minor bleeding arose irrespective of the APTT values even within the range of the APTT values not exceeding 80s. Dabigatran led to a dose-dependent prolongation of the clotting times in coagulometric tests and influenced the majority of the parameters measured. Statistically significant interference could be observed with the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and PT/aPTT-based assays (extrinsic/intrinsic factors, APC-resistance test) as well as lupus anticoagulant testing. Although aPTT does not provide a linear response to dabigatran therapy, the presence of a completely normal PTT may exclude therapeutic dabigatran anticoagulation. Commonly available global coagulation time assessments (e.g. prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) are highly influenced by rivaroxaban and dabigatran but these assays are relatively insensitive.  The relationship between dabigatran plasma concentrations and activated partial thromboplastin time in healthy volunteers and patients (n=762) was best described with a combination of a linear model and a maximum effect (Emax) model, consistent with previous reports.  We found a wide distribution of APTT in NVAF patients under dabigatran treatment. High APTT might help screen for bleeding risks among patients under dabigatran, but requires future investigation.

5a70e88699e2c3af2600000a	Describe mechanism of action of Nusinersen.	In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Spinraza (nusinersen), the first exon skipping and exon inclusion drugs, to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively. Notably, the first new central nervous system (CNS)-targeted oligonucleotide-based drug (nusinersen/Spinraza) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2016 and several other compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Nusinersen (SPINRAZA™) is a modified antisense oligonucleotide that binds to a specific sequence in the intron, downstream of exon 7 on the pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) of the SMN2 gene. This modulates the splicing of the SMN2 mRNA transcript to include exon 7, thereby increasing the production of full-length SMN protein. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) discovered in 2004 at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.  Spinraza™showed very promising results at all steps of the clinical development and was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 23, 2016.

In this study, e-training was used to train board-certified pathologists to evaluate non-small cell lung carcinoma for eligibility for treatment with onartuzumab, a MET-inhibiting agent. A Randomized Phase II Study of FOLFOX With or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach and Gastroesophageal Junction. MET immunohistochemistry expression as a biomarker of onartuzumab activity was also examined. CONCLUSION: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 in gastric cancer did not improve efficacy in an unselected population or in a MET immunohistochemistry-positive population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The YO28252 study demonstrated that the addition of the anti-MET agent onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 for treatment of gastric cancer did not improve efficacy in an overall study population or those selected for positive MET status by immunohistochemistry.  The phase II study GO27819 investigated the monovalent MET inhibitor onartuzumab plus bevacizumab (Ona + Bev) versus placebo plus bevacizumab (Pla + Bev) in recurrent glioblastoma.  We report results of METGastric, a phase 3 trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab plus standard first-line chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, MET-positive, advanced GEC. Conclusion Onartuzumab plus erlotinib did not improve clinical outcomes, with shorter OS in the onartuzumab arm, compared with erlotinib in patients with MET-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. A recent example of a failed trial is the Phase III MetLung trial that compared the effects of the c-MET monovalent antibody onartuzumab with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.  Monovalent antibody design and mechanism of action of onartuzumab, a MET antagonist with anti-tumor activity as a therapeutic agent. Because onartuzumab, a monovalent antibody to MET, blocks HGF-induced MET activation, the addition of onartuzumab to erlotinib may improve therapeutic efficacy. Because binding of sMET to onartuzumab in circulation resulted in increasing sMET serum concentrations due to reduced clearance, this likely renders sMET unsuitable as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for onartuzumab. Onartuzumab, a humanized, monovalent monoclonal anti-MET antibody, antagonizes MET signaling by inhibiting binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Monovalent antibody design and mechanism of action of onartuzumab, a MET antagonist with anti-tumor activity as a therapeutic agent Nonclinical evaluation of the serum pharmacodynamic biomarkers HGF and shed MET following dosing with the anti-MET monovalent monoclonal antibody onartuzumab. Onartuzumab, a recombinant humanized monovalent monoclonal antibody directed against MET, the receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor, has been investigated for the treatment of solid tumors. Successful therapeutic targeting of the MET/HGF pathway has been achieved using monoclonal antibodies against the MET receptor and its ligand HGF in addition to MET-specific and multitargeted small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors with several drugs in late-phase clinical trials including onartuzumab, rilotumumab, tivantinib, and cabozantinib. Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) were seen in 88.3% of patients receiving onartuzumab and in 78.3% of patients receiving placebo, with serious AEs in 55% and 40%, respectively.The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 in gastric cancer did not improve efficacy in an unselected population or in a MET immunohistochemistry-positive population.The YO28252 study demonstrated that the addition of the anti-MET agent onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 for treatment of gastric cancer did not improve efficacy in an overall study population or those selected for positive MET status by immunohistochemistry.

The reduction of the dose limit for eye lens from 150 to 20 mSv yr-1 must be implemented by EU member states by February 2018. Consequently, there is a requirement for all employers engaged with work with ionising radiation to have appropriate monitoring arrangements in place by this date to demonstrate that they can meet this new limit for all workers. Eye lens dose is conventionally monitored by specific dosemeters worn near the eye Doses to the whole body may be used as an indicator of the eye lens doses in the monitored department. Staff at nuclear medicine departments receive doses of ionising radiation higher than the staff of radiotherapy and radiology departments, with the exception of interventional radiologists The annual permissible radiation ocular lens dose has been reduced to 20 millisieverts (mSv) in the current European directive 2013/59/Euratom. The aim of this study was to evaluate the personal radiation dose for vascular interventions with special focus on ocular lens dose The yearly ocular lens dose, particularly for interventionists dealing with complex interventions, could cross the permitted yearly limit set by the new Euratom directive. Therefore, X-ray safety glasses would become mandatory for complex radiological vascular interventions.

5e2903978b3851296d000007	Describe the mechanism of action of Luspatercept.	The method is a modification of a recently published protocol for Luspatercept (ACE-536, ACVR2B-Fc), another erythropoiesis stimulating fusion protein. They are dimeric recombinant fusion proteins composed of the extracellular domain of a human activin receptor (ActRIIA or IIB) linked to the Fc part of human IgG1. Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (a modified ActRIIB-Fc) in particular are now in phase 2/3 of clinical trials against anemia and included in the prohibited list established by the World Anti-Doping Agency.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sotatercept and luspatercept are recombinant soluble activin type-II receptor-IgG-Fc fusion proteins that are tested in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of anemias, including renal anemia.  Other newly developed ESAs - luspatercept and sotatercept, both activin receptor type II-Fc fusion proteins (ActRII-Fc) - are also now prohibited and could be used in combination with rEPOs.  Recently, activin inhibitors such as Luspatercept have shown to be effective in patients' refractory to ESAs and further clinical trials are ongoing to explore this further. Combined detection of the ActRII-Fc fusion proteins Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (modified ActRIIB-Fc) in serum by means of immunoaffinity purification, tryptic digestion, and LC-MS/MS. In particular, activin receptor competitors, such as the ActRII-Fc fusion proteins Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (modified ActRIIB-Fc), have the potential for being misused as doping agents in sports as they were found to inhibit negative regulators of late-stage erythropoiesis. An example is luspatercept, an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-β signaling, thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis.

55391b2cbc4f83e828000017	What is the involvement of PDGFRB in metastatic medulloblastoma?	Imatinib blocks migration and invasion of medulloblastoma cells by concurrently inhibiting activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor and transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) expression correlates with metastatic medulloblastoma. PDGF stimulation of medulloblastoma cells phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and promotes migration Imatinib (1 μmol/L) treatment of DAOY and D556 cells inhibited PDGF-BB- and serum-mediated migration and invasion at 24 and 48 h, respectively, and concomitantly inhibited PDGF-BB activation of PDGFRB, Akt, and ERK but increased PTEN expression and activity. Imatinib treatment also induced DAOY cell apoptosis at 72 h and inhibited DAOY and D556 cell proliferation at 48 h. siRNA silencing of PDGFRB similarly inhibited signaling, migration, and survival and both siRNA and imatinib treatment inhibited PDGF-BB-mediated EGFR transactivation, indicating that the effects of imatinib treatment are specific to PDGFRB target inhibition. These results indicate that PDGFRB tyrosine kinase activity is critical for migration and invasion of medulloblastoma cells possibly by transactivating EGFR; thus, imatinib may represent an important novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of medulloblastoma.

513832a75274a5fb07000012	What is the function of the mammalian gene Irg1?	IRG1 is highly upregulated in murine ANA-1 macrophages by several proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, as well as in spleen and lung of Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, respectively The proinflammatory cytokine-induced IRG1 protein associates with mitochondria multiple genes induced by Borrelia burgdorferi in macrophages to regulate Lyme disease inflammation One of these genes, IRG1, was confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to be involved in susceptibility. Its precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, although the analysis of gene expression data suggests it has a role in apoptosis. Murine immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) plays significant roles in embryonic implantation and neurodegeneration the IRG1 gene is differentially expressed in human fetal PBMCs and LPS-stimulated adult PBMCs. we identified the immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1), which was expressed substantially higher in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated than in MAP-infected murine macrophage cell lines. The inhibitor also blocked induction by LIF of several LIF-regulated genes in the LE including Irg1, which has been shown previously to be essential for implantation. Immune-responsive gene 1 is a novel target of progesterone receptor and plays a critical role during implantation in the mouse. our studies identified Irg1 as a novel target of PR in the pregnant uterus and also revealed that it is a critical regulator of the early events leading to implantation  This resulted in the identification of one novel P4-regulated gene that had been previously found in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and called immune response gene-1 (Irg1) and which is the mammalian ortholog of the bacterial gene encoding methylcitrate dehydratase the mammalian ortholog of methylcitrate dehydratase (immune response gene 1) Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1). T Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1). This gene exhibits significant homology to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta-inducible human genes p27 and 6-16, indicating that these genes may belong to the same family The level of IRG1 mRNA again rose transiently on day 4 immediately preceding implantation. Although the functional roles of IRG1 and p27 remain unclear, we describe for the first time, identification of a gene family regulated by IFNalpha in both rodent and human uteri Hence, the induction of IRG1 by LPS is mediated by tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C pathway.	['Human IRG1 and mouse Irg1 mediates antiviral and antimicrobial immune responses, without its exact role having been elucidated.

5fdb2e3ea43ad3127800000b	What is the reason for the abundance of operons in the genome of C. elegans?	Our data shows that transcription proceeds in some ways as if operons were composed of multiple adjacent single genes.  Previous work has proposed that germline expression drives operon organization in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a recent hypothesis proposes that operons provide an evolutionary advantage via the conservation of transcriptional machinery during recovery from growth arrested states. Our data suggest that operons and "spliced leader" (SL) trans-splicing predate the radiation of the nematode phylum, an inference which is supported by the phylogenetic profile of proteins known to be involved in nematode SL trans-splicing. These results provide support for the model that a necessity for increased transcriptional efficiency in the context of certain developmental processes could be a selective constraint for operon evolution in metazoans However, analysis of gene-expression profiles identified conserved functions such as an enrichment of germline-expressed genes and higher expression levels of operonic genes during recovery from dauer arrest in both species The operons contain primarily genes required for rapid growth, including genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression. Recent evidence suggests that RNA polymerase is poised at the promoters of growth genes, and operons allow more efficient recovery from growth-arrested states, resulting in reduction in the need for this cache of inactive RNA polymerase. Caenorhabditis elegans operons contain a higher proportion of genes with multiple transcripts and use 3' splice sites differentially C. elegans operons contain a much higher proportion of genes with multiple transcript isoforms than non-operonic genes do.  Our analyses suggest that C. elegans operons enhance expression complexity by increasing the proportion of genes that express multiple transcript isoforms and maintain splicing efficiency by differential use of common 3' splice sites. Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C. elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses. Our work suggests that hybrid operons are common in the C. elegans genome and that internal promoters influence not only gene organization and expression but also operon evolution. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Further analyses suggest that this paucity of duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of gene duplication. The operons contain primarily genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression: transcription, splicing and translation. Many operons contain genes whose products are known to function together. This presumably provides co-regulation of these proteins by producing a single RNA that encodes both. genes with experimentally determined expression rates in the exponential growth phase, those of highest molar abundances are more deviant from the average gene codon frequencies and are more similar in codon frequencies to the average ribosomal protein gene.

58a3196360087bc10a00000b	What are PD-1 inhibitors?	 The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway negatively regulates T-cell activation and has an important role in regulating antitumor host immunity. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1 or the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) have shown activity in several tumor types with preliminary data suggesting a relationship between PD-L1 expression and response. Pembrolizumab is a selective humanized IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, an integral component of immune checkpoint regulation in the tumor microenvironment. Checkpoint inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 or PD-1 axis have revolutionized treatment in some solid tumors, especially melanoma and lung In recent years, the introduction and Federal Drug Administration approval of immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies has dramatically improved the clinical outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptors and have proven to be superior to ipilimumab alone. T The Next Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors: PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade in Melanoma PD-1 inhibitors are also poised to become standard of care treatment for other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkins lymphoma PD-1 inhibitors raise survival in NSCLC PD-1 inhibitors raise survival in NSCLC. PD-1-PD-1 ligand interaction contributes to immunosuppressive microenvironment of Hodgkin lymphoma. The development of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors has changed the landscape of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy, with 2 approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration of PD-1 inhibitors for second-line therapy. In this article, we will review the unique biologic features that predispose cHL to PD-1 inhibition, current data regarding the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of cHL, biomarkers of immune response, ongoing clinical trials with PD-1 inhibitors, as well as areas of uncertainty. To determine how PD-1 signaling inhibits T cell proliferation, we used human CD4(+) T cells to examine the effects of PD-1 signaling on the molecular control of the cell cycle. PD-1 inhibits T cell proliferation by upregulating p27 and p15 and suppressing Cdc25A. The field of immuno-oncology has witnessed unprecedented success in recent years, with several programmed cell death 1 and PD-L1 inhibitors obtaining US FDA registration and breakthrough drug therapy designation in multiple tumor types. The use of antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma.  Since 2010, treatment options for metastatic melanoma have been developed including chemotherapies, checkpoint inhibition immunotherapies, e.g., anti‑cytotoxic T‑lymphocyte antigen‑4 (CTLA‑4) and anti‑programmed death‑1 (PD‑1), and molecular-targeted therapies, e.g., BRAF and MEK inhibitors.  his strategy may be particularly advantageous for vaccines targeting prostate cancer, a disease for which antitumor vaccines have demonstrated clinical benefit and yet PD-1 pathway inhibitors alone have shown little efficacy to dat Manipulation of co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory checkpoint proteins allows for the reversal of tumor-induced T-cell anergy observed in cancer Colorectal cancers (CRCs) have been identified as potential targets for immunotherapy with programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitors Blockading the interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) protein with its ligands (PD-Ls, such as PD-L1) was proved to be a pathway for suppressing the development of tumors and other degradations of biological species.

56bce63cd36b5da37800000b	Describe Malgaigne fracture.	Fractures of the transverse processes in the lumbar vertebrae occur as the result of major forces such as direct blunt trauma, violent lateral flexion-extension forces, avulsion of the psoas muscle, or Malgaigne fractures of the pelvis. The anteroposterior radiographic view revealed ununited fractures at the left superior and inferior pubic ramus, noted as a type I Malgaigne fracture.  Posterior urethral injuries occur more commonly with vertically applied forces, which typically create Malgaigne-type fractures.  Patients with bilateral pubic rami fractures or Malgaigne fractures were particularly prone to additional injuries; therefore, abdominal CT examinations are recommended in these patients. Pelvic fractures, especially those of a Malgaigne type, frequently occur in patients who are polytraumatized.  The authours report the case of a 27-year-old man who had suffered a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the right side, 10 years before. The paper deals with the displacement of the uterus observed during management of Malgaigne type pelvic fracture in a 33 years old female.  This problem was first described by Malgaigne in 1857 in his classic article on double vertical fractures of the pelvis, in which he described a 34-year-old woman with a pelvic fracture who subsequently died during childbirth. Eleven cases of sacroiliac dislocation and/or fracture (Malgaigne pattern) were successfully reduced and stabilized using two threaded compression rods. We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) fracture/dislocations. A 48-year-old woman developed symptomatic superior and inferior pubic rami fractures with a concomitant subluxation of the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint three years after pelvic irradiation for a gynecologic malignancy.  Twenty-six of the thirty-two cadavera that were examined radiographically and dissected had a double break in the pelvic ring (Malgaigne pattern).  Initial hypotension, Malgaigne and bilateral pubic rami fractures, and blood requirements exceeding 2,000 cc were suggestive of abdominal trauma.   Malgaigne-type fractures with sacroiliac disruptions were created in four cadaver pelvises.  The authors report 7 cases involving the surgical treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures (Malgaigne type) using two compression bars, as described by Tile.  Malgaigne fracture is referred to pelvic ring disruption at two sites, and is often treated surgically for its instability.  Sacral fractures are generally accompanied by pelvic ring fractures.

This positioning can also result in the clustering of genes with similar expression patterns, a phenomenon sometimes called "gene kissing."  We speculate that our findings might provide insight into other types of gene kissing, some of which also require cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting proteins. The imposition at a distance of new chromatin structures with regulatory impact can occur in cis as well as in trans, and is examined as intrachromosomally spreading teleregulation and interchromosomal "gene kissing". Instances of 2 different alleles touching each other were found in 20-47% of nuclei depending on the tissue. The frequency of such "kissing" events was not significantly different in cells expressing a high proportion of the Hox clusters when compared to cells expressing none or only a few Hox genes We found that the HoxB and HoxC clusters, which are located in gene-rich regions, were involved more frequently in gene kissing in embryonic nuclei.

58cdbaf302b8c60953000044	What are Degrons?	Specific signals (degrons) regulate protein turnover mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Portable degradation sequences, or degrons, have the ability to bind to E3 ligases and promote substrate ubiquitination when the sequence is presented in isolation or appended to other entities such as fluorescent peptide-based reporters.  The N-degrons, a set of degradation signals recognized by the N-end rule pathway, comprise a protein's destabilizing N-terminal residue and an internal lysine residue. The ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades an enormous variety of proteins that contain specific degradation signals, or 'degrons'. Degron refers to an amino acid sequence that encodes a protein degradation signal, which is oftentimes a poly-ubiquitin chain that can be transferred to other proteins.  Degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the N-end rule pathway include a set called N-degrons. The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which destabilizing N-terminal amino acids of short lived proteins are recognized by recognition components (N-recognins) as an essential element of degrons, called N-degrons The N-end rule pathway is a regulated proteolytic system that targets proteins containing destabilizing N-terminal residues (N-degrons) for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in eukaryotes More than 25 years ago, the first degradation signal was discovered and defined as destabilizing N-terminal amino-acid residue (or N-degron) of protein substrates A protein domain called "degron", which induces rapid proteolysis by the proteasome, can be used for this purpose. Degron-based technologies for the conditional depletion of POI--degron fusion proteins have been developed by exploiting various pathways leading to proteasomal degradation.

Qbeta replicase lacking subunit alpha (R-alpha) is capable of replicating templates other than (+) strand, such as (--), "6S" RNA, poly(C) etc., in the absence of the host factor. Escherichia coli 6S RNA gene is part of a dual-function transcription unit. The DNA sequence results confirm the accuracy of the previously established RNA sequence and, with genomic hybridization data, reveal that there is only one copy of the 6S DNA in the chromosome. Consistent with its relaxed mode of expression, the promoter region of the 6S RNA gene was found to lack the hypothetical GC-rich discriminator domain common to other stable RNA genes under stringent control. The sequence results also revealed the occurrence of a 540-base-pair open reading frame immediately downstream from the 6S RNA coding region. 6S RNA function enhances long-term cell survival. 6S RNA-deficient cells are at a disadvantage for survival in stationary phase, a time when 6S RNA regulates transcription. 6S RNA inhibition of sigma(70)-dependent transcription was not ubiquitous, in spite of the fact that the vast majority of sigma(70)-RNA polymerase is bound by 6S RNA during stationary phase. The sigma(70)-dependent promoters inhibited by 6S RNA contain an extended -10 promoter element, suggesting that this feature may define a class of 6S RNA-regulated genes.  a secondary effect of 6S RNA in the activation of sigma(S)-dependent transcription at several promoters. 6S RNA regulation of both sigma(70) and sigma(S) activities contributes to increased cell persistence during nutrient deprivation. Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription.  Preferred binding of 6S RNA to Esigma(70) was confirmed, however weaker binding to Esigma(38) was also observed. Moreover, we show for the first time that 6S RNA acts as a template for the transcription of defined RNA molecules in the absence of DNA. In conclusion, this study reveals new aspects of 6S RNA function. 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase The release reaction depends on a characteristic property of 6S RNAs, namely to act as template for the de novo synthesis of small RNAs, termed pRNAs.Here, we used limited hydrolysis with structure-specific RNases and in-line probing of isolated 6S RNA and 6SRNA ∼ pRNA complexes to investigate the molecular details leading to the release reaction The release reaction depends on a characteristic property of 6S RNAs, namely to act as template for the de novo synthesis of small RNAs, termed pRNAs.Here, we used limited hydrolysis with structure-specific RNases and in-line probing of isolated 6S RNA and 6SRNA ∼ pRNA complexes to investigate the molecular details leading to the release reaction.

58b558d522d3005309000006	Where is the proteasome located?	Cellular regulation by UPS- mediated protein degradation is a highly specific and selective process that depends on time (e.g. cell cycle) and location (nucleus, mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum).  In eukaryotic cells, regulated protein degradation of intracellular proteins is mediated largely by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).  We followed two key parameters of this process: the distribution of proteasomes in nuclear and cytosolic compartments, and the formation of cytoplasmic aggregate-like structures called proteasome storage granules (PSGs).  Subsequently, cellular distribution of the PAI-2·proteasome complexes was established by immunogold staining and electron microscopy analyses. As judged by confocal microscopy, both proteins appeared in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but they also could be found in a dense perinuclear and nuclear location.   Frequently ubiquitinated proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation in the cytosol.   More recently, proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, production and loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA molecules, and transient homing of diverse virion proteins required for entry and/or egress have been shown to be coordinated at the centrosome.  We conclude that N-terminal sequences of Wld(S) protein influence the intranuclear location of both ubiquitin proteasome and NAD(+) synthesis machinery and that an evolutionary recent sequence mediates binding of mammalian Ube4b to VCP. Two new forms of proteasomes, designated as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated proteasome (ERa proteasome) and ER membrane-bound proteasome (ERb proteasome), were purified to homogeneity from 0.0125 and 2.5% sodium cholate extracts, respectively, of a rat liver microsomal fraction. The proteasome is a large multicatalytic, proteinase complex located in the cytosol and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Subcellular distribution of proteasomes implicates a major location of protein degradation in the nuclear envelope-ER network in yeast. JAB1, which is thought to bind p27KIP1 and transport it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for proteasome/ubiquitin-mediated degradation, was found to be localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in undifferentiated and differentiating tumors whereas located predominantly in the nucleus of differentiated tumor cells. 20S proteasomes are present in all areas where ATPase subunits are detected, consistent with the presence of intact 26S proteasomes. Inhibition of proteasomes located in axons resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in these axons. All these observations indicate that the mouse sperm proteasome participates in the binding to the zona pellucida and the acrosome reaction and that there is a pool of proteasomes located on the sperm head.. Thus, newly synthesized apoB is localized throughout the entire ER and degraded homogeneously, most likely by neighboring proteasomes located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. While misfolded and short-lived proteins are degraded in proteasomes located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, the degradation of organelles and long-lived proteins in the lysosome occurs by the process of autophagy. The GFP-tagged proteasomes were located within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Proteasomes are large multicatalytic proteinase complexes located in the cytosol and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Immunohistochemically, proteasomes (26S) were located in the cytoplasm in normal human muscle, but the staining intensity was weak. In DMRV, proteasomes often were located within or on the rim of rimmed vacuoles, and in the cytoplasm of atrophic fibers.	['The proteasome can be found in perinuclear and nuclear location, as well as in cytosolic compartments, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, production and loading of antigenic peptides onto HLA molecules, and transient homing of diverse virion proteins required for entry and/or egress have been also shown to be coordinated at the centrosome.']

We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion.

515dd9a0298dcd4e5100001e	What are the clinical trial outcomes of metformin use in polycystic ovary disease?	It has been demonstrated that by reducing hyperinsulinemia, in particular with the administration of metformin, insulin-lowering agents might improve endocrine and reproductive abnormalities in PCOS patients. Metformin has failed to gain wide acceptance as a first-line treatment option for women with anovulatory infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome. This study aimed to ascertain factors that predict fertility success with treatment that included metformin compared to standard (non-metformin) treatment. METHODS: Randomised trial data analysis by logistic regression of factors likely to have a differential influence on the likelihood of success of metformin versus non-metformin treatment amongst women with ovulation dysfunction related to polycystic ovary syndrome. RESULTS: metformin versus those receiving placebo and those with lower BMI who received metformin were more likely to become pregnant than their lower BMI counterparts who received placebo (P=0.039). This study provides preliminary evidence that BMI may be an important prognostic factor in response to metformin for women with ovulation dysfunction related to polycystic ovary syndrome, suggesting that women with a lower BMI may respond better to metformin treatment versus placebo amongst women with BMI>32 kg/m(2) A prospective comparative study including 63 patients with PCOS has been done during 2 years. Women were randomly allocated to clomifene + Metformin (Metformin group, Metformin took during 8 weeks, 850 mg twice a day, plus Clomifene 100 mg per day during five days) or Clomifene only (100 mg per day during five days) Our conclusion is that Metformin is an effective addition to Clomifene Citrate in term of reestablishment of ovulation and full-term pregnancies achievement, excluding ART cycles. A prospective, randomized, double-blind 26 week long study was undertaken in 50 women with PCOS. They all received diet and lifestyle counselling, and metformin 850 mg three times daily. nti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels reflect the number of small antral follicles in the ovaries and are elevated in PCOS. Six months of androgen suppression by either metformin or low-dose dexamethasone treatment failed to influence circulating AMH levels. The effect of metformin on serum AMH concentrations, follicle number and ovarian volume was studied in 26 women (aged 20-41 years) with PCOS after 6 months of treatment Serum AMH levels, the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume decreased significantly during metfromin treatment.

Pre-treatment with metformin prior to conventional IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS does not improve stimulation or clinical outcome. However, among normal weight PCOS women, pre-treatment with metformin tends to improve pregnancy rates. Treatment of 10 insulin-resistant PCOS women with metformin significantly increased circulating fasting ghrelin concentrations double-blind, placebo-controlled approach with detailed assessment of ovarian activity The effect of metformin on follicular maturation was rapid, because the E2 circulating concentration increased over the first week of treatment only in the metformin group. Significant (P < 0.01) weight loss (and leptin reduction) was recorded in the metformin group, whereas the placebo group actually increased weight (P < 0.05). A significant increase in circulating high-density lipoprotein was observed only in the metformin-treated group. Metabolic risk factor benefits of metformin treatment were not observed in the morbidly obese subgroup of patients (body mass index > 37). No change in fasting glucose concentrations, fasting insulin, or insulin responses to glucose challenge was recorded after 14-wk metformin or placebo therapy. We show in a large randomized placebo-controlled trial that metformin treatment improves ovulation frequency in women with abnormal ovarian function and polycystic ovaries significantly but to a modest degree, and protracted treatment improves cardiovascular risk factors. These data support a beneficial effect of metformin in improving ovarian function in women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries. studies evaluating metformin treatment in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovaries (PCO) There was no improvement in the ovulation rate despite a significant reduction of body mass index, serum testosterone and fasting leptin concentrations in the metformin group.

5167d47e298dcd4e5100005e	What is the use of MammaPrint and Oncotype DX?	Molecular tests such as the 21 gene expression test (Oncotype DX(TM)) and 70 gene microarray test (MammaPrint(®)) have revolutionized the predictive and prognostic tools in the clinic. By stratifying the risk of recurrence for patients, the tests are able to provide clinicians with more information on the treatment outcomes of using chemotherapy, HER2 targeted therapy or endocrine therapy or the combination of the therapies for patients with particular genetic expressions. Gene expression profiling tests are used in an attempt to determine the right treatment for the right person with early-stage breast cancer that may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant parts of the body. These new diagnostic approaches are designed to spare people who do not need additional treatment (adjuvant therapy) the side effects of unnecessary treatment, and allow people who may benefit from adjuvant therapy to receive it. In the present review we discuss in detail the major diagnostic tests available such as MammaPrint dx, Oncotype dx, PAM50, Mammostrat, IHC4, MapQuant DX, Theros-Breast Cancer Gene Expression Ratio Assay, and their potential clinical applications. Oncotype DX, PAM50, and MammaPrint are multigene tests that are being used clinically for early-stage breast cancer to predict recurrence risk and guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. We critically evaluated the available evidence on genomic tests in breast cancer to define their prognostic ability and likelihood to determine treatment benefit. METHODS: Independent evaluation of six genomic tests [Oncotype Dx™, MammaPrint(®), Genomic Grade Index, PAM50 (ROR-S), Breast Cancer Index, and EndoPredict] was carried out by a panel of experts in three parameters: analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility based on the principles of the EGAPP criteria. PANEL Gene expression profiling (GEP) is being used increasingly for risk stratification to identify women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, early stage breast cancer who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The authors of this report evaluated the cost effectiveness of recurrence score-guided treatment using 2 commercially available GEP tests, Oncotype DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, Calif) and MammaPrint (Agendia Inc., Irvine, Calif), from a third-party payer's perspective. genomic tumor signatures that predict a patient's risk of breast cancer recurrence and response to chemotherapy. The paper builds on empirical evidence from the two trials to explore the emergence of diverse regulatory-scientific hybrids; that is, the paper discusses configurations of genomic practice and bioclinical work that depend on linkages between technical, commercial, patient, clinical, and legal interests and institutions. The development of the genomic signatures for each trial--Oncotype DX and MammaPrint--has followed quite different routes. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes. We will review the primary tools in clinical use: Adjuvant!, Oncotype DX, and MammaPrint as well as intrinsic subtypes and the plans for their further assessment in the clinical trial setting. The expected benefit from these models are that treatment recommendations for women with early-stage breast cancer will become more individualized and thereby appropriate by combining standard clinicopathologic and molecular features. newer prognostic markers with a focus on the 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX(™)), 70-gene prognosis profile (Mammaprint(®)), and Adjuvant! Online. Conclusion: These techniques differ in their execution and application and have been demonstrated to provide further data on risk stratification as compared with conventional breast-cancer-risk factors. diagnostic tools such as MammaPrint and oncotype-DX are beginning to have impact on clinical practice of breast cancer.

We recently showed that the dendritic protein neurogranin (Ng), including the endogenous Ng peptide 48 to 76 (Ng48-76), is markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD and that Ng48-76 is the dominant peptide in human brain tissue. In agreement with previous studies, we show that CSF Ng is significantly increased in AD as compared with healthy controls.  The results suggest that CSF Ng, in particular Ng48-76, might reflect the neurodegenerative processes within the brain, indicating a role for Ng as a potential novel clinical biomarker for synaptic function in AD.  These modifications were associated with impaired spatial memory and reduced hippocampal expression of signaling molecules important for synaptic plasticity and memory, including neurogranin, CaMKII, ERK, GSK3β, CREB, and expression of the transcription factor EGR1/Zif268.  Neurogranin in cerebrospinal fluid as a marker of synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Relative quantification revealed a significant increase of neurogranin in the AD group compared with controls, while the MCI group was not statistically different from either controls or the AD group.  The elevated neurogranin levels in the MCI and AD groups might reflect synaptic degeneration. These results together suggest that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin might be valuable together with the established AD biomarkers in the early diagnosis of AD and warrants further studies to determine the diagnostic value of neurogranin. Further, to determine whether presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments of neurons are preferentially affected in AD patients, we studied 3 presynaptic vesicle proteins (synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and Rab 3A), 2 synaptic membrane proteins (Gap 43 and synaptobrevin), and 2 postsynaptic proteins (neurogranin and synaptopodin) in specimens from AD and age-matched control brains.  Our study suggests that postsynaptic proteins and presynaptic proteins are important for synaptic function and may be related to cognitive impairments in AD. These results together suggest that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin might be valuable together with the established AD biomarkers in the early diagnosis of AD and warrants further studies to determine the diagnostic value of neurogranin.

58b6a42522d300530900000b	What is the function of transthyretin in cerebrospinal fluid?	Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein that binds and distributes thyroid hormones (THs). TTR synthesised in the liver is secreted into the bloodstream and distributes THs around the body, whereas TTR synthesised in the choroid plexus is involved in movement of thyroxine from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid and the distribution of THs in the brain. This is important because an adequate amount of TH is required for normal development of the brain.  The choroid plexus forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In reptiles, birds and mammals, the main protein synthesized and secreted by the choroid plexus is a thyroid hormone distributor protein: transthyretin. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth.  Transthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.  Serum TH binding proteins play a major role for the availability of TH since only free hormone concentrations may dictate cellular uptake. One of these proteins, transthyretin is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after being secreted by the choroid plexus. Entry routes into the brain like the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-CSF-barrier will be explicated regarding fetal and adult status.  Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.  Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein secreted by the liver and choroid plexus, is mainly known as the physiological carrier of thyroxine (T(4)) and retinol.  The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-circulating homotetrameric protein Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric serum and cerebrospinal fluid protein that transports both thyroxine (T(4)) and the retinol-retinol binding protein complex (holoRBP) Dose-dependent transthyretin inhibition of T4 uptake from cerebrospinal fluid in sheep. The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain. High-affinity cellular binding sites for TTR have been described; however, their function and that of choroid plexus synthesis of TTR and transport of T4 into the cerebrospinal fluid remain unclear. Transthyretin is the major thyroxine-binding protein in the plasma of rodents, and the main thyroxine-binding protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of both rodents and humans. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid.

56c1f033ef6e39474100004f	Describe clinical presentation of Parkinsonism with dementia of Guadeloupe syndrome.	The clinical entity was a unique combination of levodopa-resistant parkinsonism, tremor, myoclonus, hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and fronto-subcortical dementia. Based on the presence or the absence of supranuclear gaze palsy, two subgroups of patients were distinguished. One-half of the patients with this tauopathy have dopa-resistant parkinsonism, tremor, subcortical dementia and abnormal eye movements suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). They also have hallucinations, dysautonomia, which are not characteristic of PSP. Furthermore, the oculomotor abnormalities and the tremor, which is jerky, differ from what is observed in classical PSP patients.  In conclusion, Gd-PSP patients have cortical myoclonus and cortical oculomotor impairments, but only minor signs of brainstem oculomotor dysfunction, suggesting that cortical dysfunction predominates over brainstem impairments.  REM sleep behavior disorder in patients with guadeloupean parkinsonism, a tauopathy. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep characteristics and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in patients with Guadeloupean atypical parkinsonism (Gd-PSP), a tauopathy resembling progressive supranuclear palsy that mainly affects the midbrain. RESULTS: REM sleep behavior disorder was found in 78% patients with Gd-PSP (43% of patients reported having this disorder several years before the onset of parkinsonism), 44% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, 33% of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and no controls. CONCLUSION: Although Gd-PSP is a tauopathy, most patients experience REM sleep behavior disorder. Only one-third of the patients that develop parkinsonian symptoms were reported to present the classical features of idiopathic Parkinson disease and one-third a syndrome resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).  Patients with a PSP-like syndrome developed levodopa-resistant parkinsonism, associated with early postural instability and supranuclear oculomotor dysfunction. They differed, however, from classical PSP patients by the frequency of tremor (>50%), dysautonomia (50%) and the occurrence of hallucinations (59%). PDC patients had levodopa-resistant parkinsonism associated with frontosubcortical dementia, 52% of these patients had hallucinations, but, importantly, none had oculomotor dysfunction. Cerebral atrophy was seen in the majority of the PSP-like and PDC patients, with enlargement of the third ventricle and marked T2-hypointensity in the basal ganglia, particularly the substantia nigra. Consumption of soursop was significantly greater in both PSP-like and PDC patients than in controls and Parkinson's disease patients. In conclusion, atypical Guadeloupean parkinsonism comprises two forms of parkinsonism and dementia that differ clinically by the presence of oculomotor signs, but have similar cognitive profiles and neuroimaging features, suggesting that they may constitute a single disease entity, and both were similarly exposed to annonaceous neurotoxins, notably annonacin. Guadeloupean parkinsonism: a cluster of progressive supranuclear palsy-like tauopathy. Postural instability with early falls, prominent frontal lobe dysfunction and pseudo-bulbar palsy were common and three-quarters of the patients were L-dopa unresponsive. One-third of all patients seen had probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Guadeloupean parkinsonism may prove to be a tauopathy identical or closely related to PSP. Progressive supranuclear palsy and its relation to pacific foci of the parkinsonism-dementia complex and Guadeloupean parkinsonism.  Now on Guadeloupe in the Carribbean French West Indies, Caparros-Lefebvre is identifying many patients with similar clinical and histological features. : On Guadeloupe, atypical parkinsonism is abnormally frequent, and represents 75% of progressive parkinsonism while Parkinson's disease (PD) accounts for only 25%, which is an inversed percentage in comparison with Europe. On the French West Indian island of Guadeloupe, atypical parkinsonian patients represent two-thirds of all cases of parkinsonism, which is exceptionally frequent compared to epidemiological data from European countries where atypical parkinsonism accounts for only approximately 5% of all cases. Atypical unclassifiable parkinsonism on Guadeloupe: an environmental toxic hypothesis. In Guadeloupe, there is an abnormally high frequency of atypical parkinsonism. Atypical parkinsonism in Guadeloupe: a common risk factor for two closely related phenotypes? Atypical parkinsonism is extremely frequent in Guadeloupe and may have an environmental cause. Atypical parkinsonism in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe: etiological role of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor annonacin. The development of atypical parkinsonism in Guadeloupe and probably elsewhere, could result from synergistic toxicity, but acetogenins are probably the most potent neurotoxin, acting as mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. Atypical parkinsonism on Guadeloupe, comparison with the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, and environmental toxic hypotheses. Two hundred and twenty consecutive patients with Parkinson's syndrome seen by the neurology service at Pointe à Pitre, Guadeloupe University Hospital were studied.

Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs. Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs.	["In mammals there is a bias in amino acid usage near splice sites that is explained, in large part, by the high density of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in these regions. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) activate pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of the flanking splice sites. Some of these variants may have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing, either by altering degenerate positions of splice site sequences or by affecting intronic or exonic splicing regulatory sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements. FELINES was shown to be useful for characterizing branchsites, polypyrimidine tracts and 5' and 3' splice sites in the intron databases and exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in S.pombe exons.

Those referring to representative scoring systems about predicting the survival of patients with metastatic spine tumors were used. The significance and limits of these scoring systems, and the future perspectives were described. Tokuhashi score, Tomita score, Baur score, Linden score, Rades score, and Katagiri score were introduced.  BACKGROUND: We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems.  Accuracy of the revised Tokuhashi score in predicting survival in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). PURPOSE: The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal disease. CONCLUSION: We would conclude that although the predictive value of the Tokuhashi score in terms of survival time is at best modest (66 %), the fact that there were statistically significant differences in survival between the groups looked at in this paper indicates that the scoring system, and the components which it consists of, are important in the evaluation of these patients when considering surgery.

58a9cd03396a458e50000003	What is the Shelterin complex?	Human telomeres are associated with the shelterin complex which consists of six telomere-associated proteins that specifically bind to telomeric DNA. Alterations or removal of individual shelterin components would lead to telomere uncapping and telomere dysfunction, resulting in cellular senescence and transformation to a malignant state. Telomeres interact with numerous proteins, including components of the shelterin complex, whose alteration, similarly to proliferation-induced telomere shortening, initiates cellular senescence. Telomere repeat binding factor TRF2 is a member of shelterin complex with an important role in protecting and stabilizing chromosomal ends. In human, the shelterin complex binds TTAGGG DNA repeats and provides capping to chromosome ends. Shelterin Protects Chromosome Ends by Compacting Telomeric Chromatin. Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, are shielded against the DNA damage response (DDR) by the shelterin complex.  Telomeres need to be protected by the shelterin complex to avoid junctions occurring between chromosomes while failing topoisomerases or clustered DNA damage processing may produce double-strand breaks, thus requiring swift repair to avoid cell death. A multiprotein complex known as shelterin prevents recognition of telomeric sequences as sites of DNA damage.

To characterize disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the United States and to determine patient factors associated with medication use. Among children without systemic arthritis, methotrexate use was most strongly associated with uveitis (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.6-7.6), anticitrullinated protein antibodies (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.7-12), and extended oligoarthritis (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5-6.6) About three-quarters of all children with JIA in the CARRA Registry received nonbiologic DMARD. Nearly one-half received biologic DMARD, and their use was strongly associated with RF-positive polyarthritis, PsA, uveitis, and systemic arthritis. pediatric JIA patients who were being treated with MTX for active uveitis Eighteen patients (18/22; 82%) showed improvement of their uveitis with a significant decrease in activity of AC inflammation after a minimal period of 3 months of MTX treatment. A topical steroid-sparing effect was observed when MTX was administered for a period of 3 to 9 months Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study) The data suggest that MTX is very effective in controlling inflammation of uveitis in patients with JIA. However, additional topical steroids or systemic immunosuppressive drugs are often required. The risk factor for development of early cataract requiring surgery in children with JIA-associated uveitis is the presence of posterior synechia at the time of diagnosis of uveitis. However, early treatment with MTX is associated with a mean delay in the development of cataract requiring surgery of 3.5 years. MTX seems to be an effective therapy for JIA associated uveitis.	["The first-line standard therapy for uveitis is topical and systemic corticosteroids, often reinforced by methotrexate as a second-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).  MTX has a topical steroid sparing effect as well. Early treatment with MTX is advocated to prevent complications such as cataract. There are no trial data on the effect of MTX. Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study). Biologic DMARDs can be used with Methotrexate in refractory uveitis as well."]
56d03a4d3975bb303a00000c	What is ceritinib?	We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib.  The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib is effective and approved for ALK-positive NSCLC in the acquired resistance setting.  Ceritinib is an oral, potent, second-generation ALK inhibitor recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Preclinical data showed impressive antitumor activity against crizotinib-resistant clones, and based on available data, ceritinib could represent a suitable option in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also presented. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.  The ALK inhibitor ceritinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.  The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib. The accelerated approval of potent ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib and more recently ceritinib (LDK378), based on the well designed phase I/II trials has been a landmark success in clinical cancer research and contributes a new era of oncogenic targeted therapy characterized by elegant clinical trial design.

5fdb43c2a43ad3127800002c	How can B-cells transdifferentiate into macrophages?	The absence of PAX-5 could have triggered B cells to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. By comparing B cells with macrophage-like cells trans-differentiated by ectopic expression of C/EBPβ, iChIP-SILAC detected B cell-specific interaction of a nuclear protein, Thy28/Thyn1, with the Pax5 1A promoter.  C/EBP-Induced Transdifferentiation Reveals Granulocyte-Macrophage Precursor-like Plasticity of B Cells Conversion of B cells to macrophages was readily induced by the ectopic expression of any C/EBP, and enhanced by endogenous C/EBPα and β activation. C/EBPβ-expressing B cells produced granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP)-like progenitors when subjected to selective pressure to eliminate lymphoid cells Through the investigation of reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other master TF-mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons. Focusing on B-cell and macrophage development, we defined a qualitative dynamical model recapitulating cytokine-induced differentiation of common progenitors, the effect of various reported gene knockdowns, and the reprogramming of pre-B cells into macrophages induced by the ectopic expression of specific transcription factors C/EBPα poises B cells for rapid reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) induces transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages at high efficiencies An ideal system to study the role of Tet2 in myelopoeisis is CEBPα-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages Our observations indicate that Tet2 helps CEBPα rapidly derepress myeloid genes during the conversion of pre-B cells into macrophages. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP(alpha))-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages involves no overt retrodifferentiation. Earlier work has shown that pre-B cells can be converted into macrophages by the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α at very high frequencies. Forced C/EBPalpha expression furthermore induces direct transdifferentiation of immature thymocytes or B cells into macrophages. Our experiments show that human cancer cells can be induced by C/EBPα to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high frequencies and provide a proof of principle for a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating B cell malignancies. Earlier work demonstrated that the transcription factor C/EBPα can convert immature and mature murine B lineage cells into functional macrophages. esting >20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPα is expressed at sufficiently high levels. A CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) induces transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages at high efficiencies and enhances reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells when co-expressed with the transcription factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (hereafter called OSKM). Howev ced C/EBPalpha expression furthermore induces direct transdifferentiation of immature thymocytes or B cells into macrophages. N  we report that enforced expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta in differentiated B cells leads to their rapid and efficient reprogramming into macrophages. C/EB A tamoxifen-inducible subclone of the Seraphina Burkitt lymphoma line, expressing C/EBPαER, could be efficiently converted into phagocytic and quiescent cells with a transcriptome resembling normal macrophages. We here investigated the acquisition of DNA methylation changes during C/EBPα-induced pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation. We also demonstrated that C/EBPα and RNA Pol II are associated with the methylated promoters of macrophage-specific genes in reprogrammed macrophages without inducing methylation changes. Testing >20 human lymphoma and leukemia B cell lines, we found that most can be transdifferentiated at least partially into macrophage-like cells, provided that C/EBPα is expressed at sufficiently high levels. Our earlier work has shown that pre-B cells can be converted into macrophage-like cells by overexpression of the transcription factor C/EBPα or C/EBPβ with high efficiency. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) induces transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages at high efficiencies and enhances reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells when co-expressed with the transcription factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (hereafter called OSKM). C/EBPα induces highly efficient macrophage transdifferentiation of B lymphoma and leukemia cell lines and impairs their tumorigenicity. C/EBPa-induced pre-B cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation provides an excellent model to investigate the contribution of miRNAs to hematopoietic cell identity, especially because the two cell types involved fall into separate lymphoid and myeloid branches.

High CO2 retention, or hypercapnia Sixty-seven stable hypercapnic COPD patients were randomised to initiation of NIV in the hospital or at home using telemedicine. Primary outcome was daytime arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) reduction after 6 months NIV, Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis are the main disadvantages of this ventilator strategy. The use of extracorporeal CO2 removal device has been introduced to support protective and ultra-protective ventilation during respiratory failure in complex cases Hypercapnia has been reported to play an active role in protection against organ injury. The aim of this study was to determine whether a higher level of partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation induces hypercapnic respiratory acidosis. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) aims to eliminate blood carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to reduce adverse effects from hypercapnia and the related acidosis. was to examine the prevalence of day 1 and sustained (day 1 and 2) hypocapnia (Paco2 < 35 mm Hg), normocapnia (Paco2 35-45 mm Hg), and hypercapnia (Paco2 > 45 mm Hg) in patients with ARDS. Secondary objectives included elucidating the effect of CO2 tension on ventilatory management and examining the r Normocapnia (82 measurements; 35 mmHg ≤ PaCO2 < 45 mmHg) and hypercapnia groups (57 measurements; 45 mmHg ≤ PaCO2) were classified. Hypercapnia is clinically defined as an arterial blood partial pressure of CO2 of above 40 mmHg and is a feature of chronic lung disease. Hypercapnia, the elevation of CO2 in blood and tissues, commonly occurs in severe acute and chronic respiratory diseases, and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Hypercapnia, an elevation of the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in blood and tissues, is a marker of poor prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other pulmonary disorders. Hypercapnia, the elevation of CO2 in blood and tissue, commonly develops in patients with advanced lung disease and severe pulmonary infections, and it is associated with high mortality. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) retention, or hypercapnia, is a known risk of diving that can cause mental and physical impairments leading to life-threatening accidents. Hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide) are co-incidental features of the tissue microenvironment in a range of pathophysiologic states, including acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Elevated blood and tissue CO(2), or hypercapnia, is common in severe lung disease. The effect of hypercapnia (an increase in CO(2) concentration in the blood) on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) haemodynamic response has been well characterised and is commonly used for BOLD calibration.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000009	What is known about the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring?	In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The outcome of one study suggested that children with autism were more likely to have a mother who was prescribed an SSRI during pregnancy. A history of maternal (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.08) but not paternal depression was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. In the subsample with available data on drugs, this association was confined to women reporting antidepressant use during pregnancy (3.34, 1.50 to 7.47, P=0.003), irrespective of whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors were reported. In utero exposure to both SSRIs and non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants) was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, particularly without intellectual disability. Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development, concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment, interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs, especially during the first trimester.  Among the potential environmental factors, hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues, hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs, and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy.  In adjusted logistic regression models, we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3]), with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-7.8]). Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low, results suggest that exposure, especially during the first trimester, may modestly increase the risk of ASD.  Together, these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.  Although several studies have not confirmed an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopment, a recent study observed an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in prenatally exposed offspring.  Considering the important role of serotonin in central nervous system development, more studies are needed to assess the possible adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopment.	['Greater risk for autism spectrum disorders has been reported among mothers that have used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. However, others did not find an association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring. Also, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy were associated with a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with autism spectrum disorders.']
58a3264e60087bc10a00000d	What are reactive metabolites?	The results implicate the cis-enedial reactive metabolite of DIOB was responsible for the observed toxicities. The observed modest depletion of hepatic GSH in DIOB-treated animals suggests the actions of one or more reactive metabolites, and the hepatic injury observed could be due at least in part to reactions of these metabolites with crucial biomolecules. Cytochrome P450 3A enzymes are implicated in DIOB-induced hepatotoxicities by catalyzing the formation of the reactive metabolite of DIOB. . The neurotoxicity of endosulfan and its metabolites is closely related to oxidative damage and antioxidative deficit. Our data from this study strongly indicate that Dic as well as its metabolites could be involved in the hepato-toxic action through inhibition of ATP synthesis. Reactive metabolites can form adducts with trapping reagents, such as glutathione, which makes the reactive metabolites detectable. [Reactive metabolites of xenobiotics : their role in the hepatotoxicity of drugs]. The formation of reactive metabolites has been associated with the observed hepatotoxicity. Electrochemical oxidation of troglitazone: identification and characterization of the major reactive metabolite in liver microsomes. DNA bases attack by reactive metabolites produced during carbon tetrachloride biotransformation and promotion of liver microsomal lipid peroxidation. Certain drugs are transformed into reactive metabolites by cytochrome P-450, a hepatic microsomal enzyme. The reactive metabolites covalently bind to hepatocyte macromolecules, thus determining liver lesions. Induction of microsomial enzymes increases the formation of reactive metabolites and exaggerates hepatotoxicity of these drugs. It is generally accepted that a predominant pathway of drug-induced toxicity is through the generation of reactive metabolites. In addition, the incidence and nature of adverse reactions associated with a given drug is probably determined in large measure by the location of reactive metabolite formation, as well as the chemical reactivity of the reactive metabolite. Reactive metabolite-mediated toxicity is frequently limited to the organ where the electrophilic metabolites are generated. While there is a disproportionate number of compounds metabolized to reactive metabolites that are associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity and serious skin toxicities such as toxic endothelial necrolysis and Steven's Johnson syndrome,  Central to most hypotheses of the mechanism of idiosyncratic drug-induced blood dyscrasias is the involvement of reactive metabolite Although idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are rare, they are still a major concern to patient safety. Reactive metabolites are widely accepted as playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions.  detection and identification of minor reactive metabolites are equally important since the minor metabolites, even though at low levels, may be highly reactive and also play an important role in drug-induced adverse reactions.  Metabolic activation of a drug leading to reactive metabolite(s) that can covalently modify proteins is considered an initial step that may lead to drug-induced organ toxicities. Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for most idiosyncratic drug reactions.  This review will focus on our current understanding and speculative views on how a reactive metabolite of a drug might ultimately lead to immune-mediated toxicity he decline in approval of new drugs during the past decade has led to a close analysis of the drug discovery process. One of the main reasons for attrition is preclinical toxicity, frequently attributed to the generation of protein-reactive drug metabolites. Reactive metabolites are estimated to be one of the main reasons behind unexpected drug-induced toxicity, by binding covalently to cell proteins or DNA rug metabolism can result in the formation of highly reactive metabolites that are known to play a role in toxicity resulting in a significant proportion of attrition during drug development and clinical use.  The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected cause of many adverse drug reactions.  Drug bioactivation leading to the formation of reactive species capable of covalent binding to proteins represents an important cause of drug-induced toxicity. The traditional view of these reactive oxygen metabolites is one of oxidative stress and damage that leads to decline of tissue and organ systems in aging and disease  A number of withdrawn drugs are known to undergo bioactivation by a range of drug metabolizing enzymes to chemically reactive metabolites that bind covalently to protein and DNA resulting in organ toxicity and carcinogenesis	['Reactive metabolites are generated when a small molecule, commonly a drug or hydrocarbon, is broken down in the body.

58a3275960087bc10a00000f	What are some of the effects of Zika Virus in infected individuals?	Maternal-fetal transmission of Zika virus has been documented; evidence suggests that congenital Zika virus infection is associated with microcephaly and other adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes Recent studies have reported an increase in the number of fetuses and neonates with microcephaly whose mothers were infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. ika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes species mosquitoes, and symptoms of infection can include rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis (1).* Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe brain defects (2). Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome To better understand the etiologic role and mechanism(s) of Zika virus in causing birth defects such as microcephaly, Most persons infected with Zika virus have a mild illness or are asymptomatic. However, increasing evidence supports a link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes (1), and a possible association between recent Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome has been reported (2). There is now strong biologic evidence of causality between Zika virus and microcephaly and other neurologic abnormalities identified. Several pieces of evidence suggest that maternal Zika virus infection is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, most notably microcephaly.  Zika virus has gained international attention due to concerns for infection in pregnant women potentially causing fetal microcephaly. Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and infection can be asymptomatic or result in an acute febrile illness with rash (1). Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe birth defects (2). Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (3) and severe thrombocytopenia (4,5) Most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic (1,6). Clinical illness, when it occurs, is generally mild and characterized by acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes such as fetal loss, and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies  In 2015, Zika virus infection was diagnosed in Brazil where it was associated with microcephaly in the infants of some women who were pregnant when they contracted the disease. Cases of the Guillain-Barré syndrome were also found to be associated with Zika virus These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil  In response to the current cluster of congenital malformations (microcephaly) and other neurological complications (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) that could be linked to Zika virus infection, WHO declares that Zika virus is of global public health importance.  Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion and birth defects, including microcephaly n the case of Zika virus, an accumulating body of recent evidence implicates the virus in the etiology of serious pathologies of the human nervous system, that is, the occurrence of microcephaly in neonates and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. We describe the first case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring immediately after a Zika virus infection, during the current Zika and type 1 and 3 dengue fever co-epidemics in French Polynesia. We report a case of Zika virus infection in an Australian traveler who returned from Indonesia with fever and rash woman who recently traveled to Thailand came to a local emergency department with a fever and papular rash. She was tested for measles, malaria, and dengue. Positive finding for IgM antibody against dengue and a failure to seroconvert for IgG against dengue for multiple blood samples suggested an alternate flavivirus etiology. Amplification of a conserved region of the non-structural protein 5 gene of the genus Flavivirus yielded a polymerase chain reaction product with a matching sequence of 99% identity with Zika virus. A urine sample and a nasopharygeal swab specimen obtained for the measles investigation were also positive for this virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactio  It is estimated that approximately 18% of individuals infected with ZIKV will go on to develop symptoms. When symptoms develop, it is usually within 3-12 days, although this may vary. Most often, symptoms are mild and self-limited. The most common symptoms are fever, arthralgia, maculopapular rash, and conjunctivitis lasting up to seven days. Less frequent symptoms include headache, vertigo, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhea. At present, there is no vaccine available to prevent ZIKV and no specific antiviral treatment. Supportive care consisting of rest, hydration, analgesics, antihistamines, and antipyretics is recommended as needed.  marked increase in infants born with microcephaly in Brazil after a 2015 outbreak of Zika virus (Zika virus) disease suggests an association between maternal Zika virus infection and congenital microcephaly. Zika virus causes a self-limiting, systemic illness; however, the current outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas has been associated with increased rates of fetal malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome	['While most of the symptoms of zika virus are relatively mild, zika virus in pregnant mothers can cause microcephaly and other congenital defects in the fetus.']

Vivotif® is an oral live attenuated vaccine which contains a mutated strain of Salmonella (Ty21a) and reproduces the natural infection. The vaccine was first licensed in Europe in 1983 and in the US in 1989, and over the years it has proved efficacious and safe. It is indicated for adults and children from 5 years of age upwards. Specifically, in the most developed countries, vaccination is suggested for highrisk population groups and particularly for international travellers to destinations where the risk of contracting typhoid fever is high.  Vivotif® appears to be a powerful means of disease prevention, the importance of which is highlighted by the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella typhy (S. typhi).

56b9cabbac7ad10019000002	What is the role of Caenorhabditis elegans Heterochromatin protein 1 (HPL-2) in development?	Caenorhabditis elegans Heterochromatin protein 1 (HPL-2) links developmental plasticity, longevity and lipid metabolism.  We show that HPL-2 regulates the expression of germline genes, extracellular matrix components and genes involved in lipid metabolism. Comparison of our expression data with HPL-2 ChIP-on-chip profiles reveals that a significant number of genes up- and down-regulated in the absence of HPL-2 are bound by HPL-2. Germline genes are specifically up-regulated in hpl-2 mutants, consistent with the function of HPL-2 as a repressor of ectopic germ cell fate.  HPL-2 regulates the dauer developmental decision, a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in which environmental conditions determine developmental fate. Our results suggest that the worm HP1 homologue HPL-2 may coordinately regulate dauer diapause, longevity and lipid metabolism, three processes dependent on developmental input and environmental conditions. Interestingly, lin-61 genetically interacts with two other synMuvB genes, hpl-2, an HP1 homologous H3K9me2/3 binding factor, and met-2, a SETDB1 homologous H3K9 methyl transferase (H3K9MT), in determining C. elegans vulva development and fertility. We have specifically characterized the intranuclear positioning of in vivo fluorescence of the Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 homologue HPL-2 as a marker for heterochromatin domains in developing embryos.  While HPL-2 functions in vulval and germline development, no function has so far been attributed to HPL-1. Here we report the characterization of an hpl-1 null allele. We show that while the absence of hpl-1 alone results in no obvious phenotype, hpl-1;hpl-2 double mutants show synthetic, temperature sensitive phenotypes including larval lethality and severe defects in the development of the somatic gonad. Furthermore, we find that hpl-1 has an unexpected role in vulval development by acting redundantly with hpl-2, but not other genes previously implicated in vulval development. Localization studies show that like HPL-2, HPL-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein. However, HPL-1 and HPL-2 localization does not completely overlap. Our results show that HPL-1 and HPL-2 play both unique and redundant functions in post-embryonic development. We show that one of the homologues, HPL-2, is required for the formation of a functional germline and for the development of the vulva by acting in an Rb-related pathway.  A heterochromatin protein 1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans acts in germline and vulval development.

In this report, we demonstrate that systemic administration of an NK3R antagonist (ESN364) prolongs the LH interpulse interval in ovarectomized ewes and significantly lowers plasma LH and FSH concentrations in castrated nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis). Moreover, daily oral dosing of ESN364 throughout the menstrual cycle in M fascicularis lowered plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner, although nadir levels of estradiol were maintained well above menopausal levels. Nevertheless, estradiol levels during the follicular phase were sufficiently inhibited at all doses to preclude the triggering of ovulation as evidenced by the absence of the LH surge and failure of a subsequent luteal phase rise in plasma progesterone concentrations, consistent with the absence of normal cycle changes in the uterus. Apart from the point at surge, FSH levels were not altered over the course of the menstrual cycle. These effects of ESN364 were reversible upon cessation of drug treatment. The NK3 Receptor Antagonist ESN364 Suppresses Sex Hormones in Men and Women. ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Drug effects were rapidly reversible.  Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women. These results suggest that ESN364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events.

5e369c30b5b409ea53000001	Describe ChromoTrace	ChromoTrace: Computational reconstruction of 3D chromosome configurations for super-resolution microscopy. The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance.

530f7d7fe3eabad021000002	What is the role of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone in the treatment of comatose patients?	Despite the correction of these metabolic disorders, the patient became comatose, and MRI, on T2 weighted image, showed hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia consistent with extra-pontine myelinolysis. The patient's state remained unchanged for six weeks. Since S. Konno and H. Wakui published cases of myelinolysis who dramatically improved after TRH treatment, the patient was given 0.6 mg i.v daily of TRH for six weeks. Improvement began within a few days, and continued until complete recovery. His CNS symptoms improved dramatically after administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone tartrate (TRH-T). [Montirelin hydrate (NS-3), a TRH analog, improved the disturbance of consciousness caused by head concussion and pentobarbital in mice]. NS-3 shortened the latent periods to the recovery of the righting reflex (0.03-0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) and spontaneous motor activity (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) following the head concussion. In the case of TRH, higher doses were needed to induce such effects. NS-3 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed the pentobarbital-induced narcosis in a dose-dependent manner. A similar effect was elicited by 30- to 100-fold higher doses of TRH than NS-3. Taken together with the finding that NS-3 did not bind to dopamine, adrenaline or muscarine receptors, it is suggested that NS-3 may restore the disturbance of consciousness by activating the brain dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine neurons without stimulating these receptors directly. A 46-year-old female motorcyclist, who suffered injuries to the brain stem in a traffic accident, showed hypotensive and bradycardiac responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given to counter consciousness disturbance. The direct TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) stimulation to the anterior lobe was responded to well.  The neuropharmacological activities of TRH include an interesting arousal effect and an analeptic action on generalized depression of the CNS whether this depression is of natural origin, such as hibernation, or induced pharmacologically (barbiturates, ethanol) or of a traumatic origin (coma). This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma and for the treatment of endogenous depression.  In the vegetative group, TRH caused significant increases in MBP (from 91 +/- 8 mm Hg to 110 +/- 10 mm Hg) at 2 min after the injection [p < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Scheffé F-test]. In contrast, five of the seven BD patient showed no alterations in the measured parameter in response to the TRH injection. However, the remaining two BD patients, who had spinal reflexes, exhibited an elevation in MBP.  These results indicate that in comatose patients, the hemodynamic effects of TRH may differ depending on impairments in the central nervous system; the results support previous reports indicating a mediation of the central sympathetic nervous system in the development of pressor effects of TRH.

As determined by the new dissociation constants, antipsychotic drugs which elicit Parkinsonism (trifluperazine, chlorpromazine, raclopride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, risperidone) bind more tightly than dopamine to D2, while those antipsychotic drugs which elicit little or no Parkinsonism (melperone, seroquel, perlapine, clozapine, remoxipride, molindone, sulpiride, olanzapine, sertindole) bind more loosely than dopamine to D2 receptors. Compared to the tightly bound antipsychotic drugs, the more loosely bound antipsychotics generally require higher clinical doses, require fewer days for clinical adjustment, but may dissociate from the D2 receptor more rapidly and could lead to clinical relapse somewhat earlier than that found with the traditional tightly bound antipsychotic drugs. All antipsychotic drug treatments examined in this study caused a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex.  Other drugs of the typical (molindone and pimozide) and atypical (remoxipride) classes had no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue.   Loxapine is an alternative when sedation is necessary and molindone is useful if a short-acting antipsychotic is required.  Neuroleptics with a clearly documented liability for producing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, metoclopramide and molindone elevated FLI in the dorsolateral striatum. Pretreatment with molindone (0.45 and 0.8 mg/kg IP), in doses reported to selectively block the presynaptic DA receptors, not only decreased the cataleptic effect of AP but also reversed the AP antagonism of methamphetamine stereotypy.  The antagonist molindone exhibits selectivity for cortical serotonin-stimulated cyclase versus dopamine-stimulated cyclase and may prove useful for further elucidating the sites of lisuride action.  Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine.

Following the 25 d lesion, we administered PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, for 30 d to eliminate microglia.  .METHODS: Using x-ray co-crystallography to guide our drug-discovery research, we generated a potent, selective CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, that traps the kinase in the autoinhibited conformation. Treatment with PLX3397, a small molecule inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R and related kinases, decreases microglial numbers by promoting microglial apoptosis in both CSF1 overexpressing and control mice. Sustained inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases and macrophage depletion by PLX3397 and rapamycin as a potential new approach for the treatment of MPNSTs. We hypothesized that PLX3397, which inhibits KIT and colony-stimulating-factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), would be more efficacious than imatinib in GIST by also depleting tumor-associated macrophages, which are generally thought to support tumor growth. The cytokine CSF-1 (or M-CSF) is an important factor of TAM recruitment and differentiation and several pharmacological agents targeting the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) have been developed to regulate TAM in solid cancers. We show that the kinase inhibitor PLX3397 strongly dampened the systemic and local accumulation of macrophages driven by B16F10 melanomas, without affecting Gr-1(+) myeloid derived suppressor cells.  The CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase that is targetable by small molecule inhibitors such as PLX3397. In conclusion, CSF-1R blockade with PLX3397 improved the efficacy of ACT immunotherapy by inhibiting the intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive macrophages.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic virus which circulates in pigs and wild boars as main reservoir species.  Rodents and bats are now widely recognised as important sources of zoonotic virus infections in other mammals, including humans. Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus harbored by bats and lethal to humans. A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be passed from animals to humans. Zoonotic viruses may adapt to a human host eventually becoming endemic in humans, but before doing so punctuated outbreaks of the zoonotic virus may be observed.  Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a close relative of Variola virus, is a zoonotic virus with an unknown reservoir. 	['A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be passed from animals to humans.

5525317687ecba3764000007	Which type of cell death is known as anoikis?	As a barrier to metastasis of cancer, cells that lost contact with the neighbouring cells or extracellular matrix(Extracellular matrix, ECM) will be subjected to apoptosis. This cell death process has been termed "anoikis". When normal epithelial cells or solid tumor cells without metastatic potential detach from the primary site, and then enter into the circulatory system, the anoikis mechanism will be activated. The significance of anoikis is to prevent the shedding cells from growing and implanting into other inappropriate sites.  Anoikis is a programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment from extracellular matrix, behaving as a critical mechanism in preventing adherent-independent cell growth and attachment to an inappropriate matrix, thus avoiding colonizing of distant organs.  As a barrier to metastasis, cells normally undergo an apoptotic process known as "anoikis," a form of cell death due to loss of contact with the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells. Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation. It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix. Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development.  Detachment from the extracellular matrix induces a form of programmed cell death termed anoikis. Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in systemic circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs. Anoikis - apoptotic cell death triggered by loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts - is dysregulated in many chronic debilitating and fatal diseases. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in cell-cell communication and signaling, and the signals it propagates are important for tissue remodeling and survival. However, signals from disease-altered ECM may lead to anoikis-apoptotic cell death triggered by loss of ECM contacts. Anoikis is a mode of apoptotic cell death, consequential to insufficient cell-matrix interactions and a critical player in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Anoikis is also a physiologic process in normal cells used to maintain homeostasis, in which cell death is induced in response to loss of extracellular membrane (ECM) attachment. Cancer cells are notoriously resistant to anoikis, enabling metastasis and new tumor growth beyond their original environment. Anoikis is a subtype of apoptosis induced by detachment of adherent cells from the extracellular matrix. Developed organs display strict spatial organization of differentiated cells which is required for proper organ function. One important device that prevents tissue disorganization is the death of cells that lose anchorage to their native matrix, a signal that indicates potential loss of proper tissue context. Termed anoikis (Greek for Homelessness), this form of cell death is a specialized form of apoptosis. As a barrier to metastases, cells normally undergo apoptosis after they lose contact with their extra cellular matrix or their neighbouring cells. This cell death process has been termed "anoikis". Tumour cells that acquire malignant potential have developed mechanisms to resist anoikis and thereby survive after detachment from their primary site and while travelling through the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Epithelial cells require attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) to suppress an apoptotic cell death program termed anoikis.  Detachment of adherent epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix induces apoptosis, known as anoikis. Integrin stimulation protects cells from anoikis, but the responsible mechanisms are not well known. Apoptosis triggered by cell detachment from the extracellular matrix, which occurs during hepatocyte isolation, is a phenomenon termed "anoikis". It's importance in the normal physiologic development of the human body, as well as in disease states, has been described. Cancer cells harbor anoikis resistance allowing spread to occur. Anoïkis is defined as programmed cell death induced by the loss of cell/matrix interactions. Adhesion to structural glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix is necessary for survival of the differentiated adherent cells in the cardiovascular system, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and cardiac myocytes. Adhesion is also a key factor for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. In particular, fibronectin is considered a factor of survival and differentiation for many adherent cells. Adhesion generates cell tensional integrity (tensegrity) and repression of apoptotic signals, whereas detachment has the opposite effect. Anoïkis plays a physiological role by regulating cell homeostasis in tissues. Anoikis is a special type of programmed cell death after loss of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Detachment-induced cell death, or anoikis, is a type of apoptosis that occurs when epithelial cells lose their attachment to the extracellular matrix. Anoikis is a type of apoptosis due to the detachment from the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells.

5fdb40eba43ad31278000014	Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?	Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization. Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4 Together with architectural proteins and transcriptional regulators, such as CTCF and Mediator, respectively, it contributes to genome organization at different scales and thereby affects transcription, DNA replication, and locus rearrangement. By defining the organizational hierarchy of the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin, CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.  Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly. Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes.

Although  Loss of nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins, transcription factors (TFs), histone modification enzymes, Mediator, and factors involved in mRNA export disrupts the physical interaction of chromosomal sites with NPCs. Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression. This study provides an extensive genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway. Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has a crucial coregulator function in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network that determines NSC identity. These advances emphasize the importance of genomic proximity and nuclear organization for homology search and the critical role of homology search mediators in this process. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while Tail and CKM play regulatory roles. Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM). Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing. The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters. Individual Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently associating kinase module. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space.

54fc3cf410565e080c000001	Which phenomenon is known as the "calcium paradox" in the isolated perfused heart?	"Calcium paradox" as a term describes the deleterious effects conferred to a heart perfused with a calcium-free solution followed by repletion, including loss of mechanical activity and sarcomere disruption. Calcium paradox was found to markedly activate members of the MAPKs (p43-ERK, JNKs, p38-MAPK).  To our knowledge, this is the first time that the calcium paradox has been shown to induce apoptosis in amphibians, with p38-MAPK and calpain playing significant roles. The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. We and others have demonstrated that contracture and calpain are involved in the Ca(2+) paradox-induced injury. The Ca(2+) paradox was elicited by perfusing isolated rat hearts with Ca(2+)-free KH media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. These results provide evidence suggesting that contracture is the main cause for contractile dysfunction, while activation of calpain mediates cell death in the Ca(2+) paradox. The Ca2+ -paradox is an important phenomenon to study cell injury induced by Ca2+ -overload in myocardium. Although intracellular Ca2+ -overload acts as a trigger and modulator of cell death due to apoptosis under various pathophysiological conditions, the presence of apoptosis in hearts subjected to Ca2+ -paradox has not been demonstrated. Ca2+ -paradox was induced by perfusing the isolated rat heart with Ca2+ -free medium for 5 min followed by reperfusion with Ca2+ -containing medium for 30 min. This study suggests that cardiac dysfunction due to Ca2+ -paradox may be associated with apoptosis. Normothermic 3 min lasting perfusion of the isolated rat heart by Krebs--Henseleit solution in which Ca2+ was replaced by EDTA and subsequent perfusion with a Ca2+ containing medium induced structural and metabolic changes demonstrated electron microscopically and histochemically. In contrast to the ischemic reperfusion damage, in calcium paradox, the histochemically studied enzymes alpha-glucan-phosphorylase, lactate dehydrogenase, succinic dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, and ATPases were better preserved in the subendocardial region of the left ventricle. On the other hand, myocytes in the subepicardial region and in the midmyocardium were markedly damaged and all characteristic signs of calcium paradox were present, including hypercontraction bands with myofilament fusion, extrusion and accumulation of edematous mitochondria with occurrence of electron dense material in mitochondrial cristae, ruptures of the sarcolemma in all its layers, separation of intercalated discs, etc. Intracellular Ca2+-overload in the myocardium can be induced not only after readmission of Ca2+-containing fluid to rat hearts previously perfused with a Ca2+-free buffer, a phenomenon called "the calcium paradox", but also during administration of a Ca2+-ionophore to cardiac tissue. In rat hearts, the myocardial damage induced by the Ca2+ paradox was more pronounced than that after administration of the Ca2+-ionophore A23187, as indicated by the amount of lactate dehydrogenase released. When hearts were reperfused with Ca++ after a short period of Ca++-free perfusion, irreversible loss of electrical and mechanical activity was observed. This phenomenon, first described by Zimmerman and Hulsmann, was termed the "calcium paradox". Chizzonite and Zak recently reported that rat hearts exhibited an age-dependent response in a calcium paradox model.  Injury is sustained by isolated hearts on repletion with calcium after a short period of perfusion with calcium-free medium at 37 degrees. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-fre medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Isolated perfusion of the heart with a Ca2+-free perfusate followed by a Ca2+-containing perfusate causes dramatic alterations in the physiology and biochemistry of the tissue, a phenomenon known as the calcium paradox.

The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the \'calcium paradox\' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx.

58d388958acda34529000006	What is a mimotope vaccine?	These data are proof of principle that by performing affinity selection on neutralizing antibodies, our VLP technology can identify peptide mimics of non-linear epitopes and that these mimotope based VLP vaccines provide protection against pathogens in relevant animal models. A major hurdle in vaccine development is the difficulty in identifying relevant target epitopes and then presenting them to the immune system in a context that mimics their native conformation. We have engineered novel virus-like-particle (VLP) technology that is able to display complex libraries of random peptide sequences on a surface-exposed loop in the coat protein without disruption of protein folding or VLP assembly. This technology allows us to use the same VLP particle for both affinity selection and immunization, integrating the power of epitope discovery and epitope mimicry of traditional phage display with the high immunogenicity of VLPs. Our data suggest that the improved tumor immunity results from the expansion of mimotope-elicited tumor-specific T cells that have increased avidity for the tumor antigen. The enhanced T cells are phenotypically distinct and enriched for T-cell receptors previously correlated with improved antitumor immunity. These results suggest that incorporation of native antigen into clinical mimotope vaccine regimens may improve the efficacy of antitumor T-cell responses. One strategy for overcoming these mechanisms is vaccination with mimotopes, or peptide mimics of tumor antigens, which alter the antigen presentation and/or T cell activation to increase the expansion of tumor-specific T cells.  The high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) is an attractive target for immunotherapy of malignant melanoma. We have recently generated a vaccine based on the HMW-MAA mimotope 225D9.2+ that was able to induce anti-HMW-MAA antibodies with antitumor activity in vitro.  Peptide mimics of a conformational epitope that is recognized by a mAb with antitumor activity are promising candidates for formulations of anticancer vaccines. These mimotope vaccines are able to induce a polyclonal Ab response focused to the determinant of the mAb.  Carbohydrate mimetic peptides of tumor associated carbohydrate antigens (TACA) are T-cell-dependent antigens and, therefore, immunization with these surrogates is predicted to overcome the low immunogenicity of carbohydrate antigens. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that among the potential immune cells involved, peptide immunization led to an increase in T-cell populations.  To explore the mimotope vaccine approach against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), five IBDV-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared and their binding peptides were screened against a phage-displayed 12-mer peptide library. After three rounds of biopanning, 12 phages were selected for each mAbs and their specificity to IBDV was verified by sandwich and competitive inhibition ELISAs. Seven phages per mAb were sequenced and their amino acid sequences were deduced. The five representative sequences of mimotopes corresponding mAbs were determined. An artificial gene, designated 5epis (5 epitopes) and consisting of the five mimotopes arranged in tandem (F1-F7-B34-2B1-2G8) with four GGGS spacers, was chemically synthesized and cloned into a prokaryotic expression plasmid pET28b.  The mimotope vaccine was then generated by coupling the most suitable candidate mimotope to tetanus toxoid as an immunogenic carrier. We hypothesized that boosting the mimotope vaccine with the native tumor antigen would focus the T-cell response elicited by the mimotope toward high affinity, tumor-specific T cells. Following the mice immunization, phage-based mimotope vaccine induced humoral immunity. In this article we focus on cancer vaccines for antibody production, in particular mimotope vaccines. Vaccines that incorporate peptide mimics of tumor antigens, or mimotope vaccines, are commonly used in cancer immunotherapy and function by eliciting increased numbers of T cells that cross-react with the native tumor antigen. We hypothesized that boosting the mimotope vaccine with the native tumor antigen would focus the T-cell response elicited by the mimotope toward high affinity, tumor-specific T cells. Augmenting antitumor T-cell responses to mimotope vaccination by boosting with native tumor antigens. Induction of protective immune responses against NXS2 neuroblastoma challenge in mice by immunotherapy with GD2 mimotope vaccine and IL-15 and IL-21 gene delivery. These mimotope vaccines are able to induce a polyclonal Ab response focused to the determinant of the mAb. We therefore suggest that mimotope gene vaccines are potential candidates for epitope-specific immunotherapy of type I allergy. Conformational B-cell epitopes on the HCV E2 protein recognized by human antibodies were characterized by the use of a peptide mimotope named K1. Following the mice immunization, phage-based mimotope vaccine induced humoral immunity. In this article we focus on cancer vaccines for antibody production, in particular mimotope vaccines.	['A mimotope vaccine contains peptide mimics of specific antigen epitopes, which alter the antigen presentation and/or T cell activation to increase the expansion of tumor-specific T cells and are able to induce polyclonal antibodies response.']

5a895a96fcd1d6a10c000003	Can a circRNA be translated into protein?	However, whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although translation of several circRNAs was recently reported Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs.  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large type of noncoding RNAs characterized by their circular shape resulting from covalently closed continuous loops. They are known to serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and encode for proteins. Covalently closed loop structures elevate the stability of this new type of noncoding RNA.  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNA that assumes a covalently closed continuous conformation.  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNAs produced by circularization of specific exons.  Circ-ZNF609 Is a Circular RNA that Can Be Translated and Functions in Myogenesis.  Circ-ZNF609 is associated with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for translation of circRNAs, revealing the existence of an unexplored layer of gene activity. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

57169a49cb4ef8864c00000a	What is the mechanism of action of decitabine?	The use of the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine (Dacogen®) has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and its clinical effects on solid tumors have gained attention. low-dose decitabine and combined therapy show significant improvement in solid tumor treatment. Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent degradation of Dnmt1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing catalytic site mutant (cys-ser), confirming that the covalent bond formation between Dnmt1 and decitabine-incorporated DNA is not essential for this process. NMT1o, the oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the N-terminal 118-amino acid domain, did not undergo decitabine-mediated degradation, which further proves the requirement of multiple domains including nuclear localization signa Analysis of glycerol density gradient fractions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei showed that both nucleosomal and nucleoplasmic DNMT1 are degraded upon decitabine treatment. The maximal effect caused by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) persuaded us to investigate further its role in decitabine-mediated DNMT1 degradation.  These studies provide substantial evidence that decitabine-induced degradation of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 does not require covalent bond formation with the substrate and also elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Decitabine is a potent demethylating agent that exhibits clinical activity against myeloid malignancies. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. Recent studies indicating that decitabine also induces regional chromatin remodeling of some unmethylated genes suggest additional mechanisms of action. Our findings indicate that decitabine can relieve p21WAF1 repression in AML by a mechanism that involves release of HDAC1 without requiring promoter demethylation. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) can relieve p21WAF1 repression in human acute myeloid leukemia by a mechanism involving release of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) without requiring p21WAF1 promoter demethylation. Decitabine, a demethylating drug, is the first-line treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and gains better overall survival, which is based on epigenetic mechanism Demethylating agent decitabine was reported to be able to up-regulate CTAs through its hypomethylation mechanism, thus enhance the immunogenicity of leukemia cells However, further elucidation of its mechanism of action is required, as clinical response to decitabine does not correlate with demethylation of the p15 gene promoter or the repetitive DNA element LINE.  In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is increasingly used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear.

56bf4035ef6e394741000010	What is 2d 4d ratio in athletes.	RESULTS: A highly significant difference was found in 2D:4D ratios of both the hands with Kabaddi players having a lower ratio compared to their controls. There was no statistically significant difference in 2D:4D (Δ r-l) between Kabaddi players and controls. BACKGROUND: Ratio of second and fourth digit (2D:4D) is known to be germane in analyzing utero concentrations of testosterone and estrogen in human and other vertebrates. 2D:4D had been linked to several traits like athletes' abilities, reproductive success, risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  There was also a lower digit ratio in both females and males. Research from other fields is presented to suggest that healthy individuals with low 2D:4D ratio have enhanced sporting prowess, particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and dependent upon slow-twitch muscles.  Varsity athletes have lower 2D:4D ratios than other university students. The 2D:4D ratio has been negatively correlated with many factors, including aggression, physical fitness, and athleticism. Our results confirmed that both male (mean ± s(x) : 0.97 ± 0.004) and female (0.98 ± 0.005) varsity athletes had significantly lower ratios than their non-varsity peers (males: 0.99 ± 0.004; females: 1.00 ± 0.006), and that male athletes had significantly lower 2D:4D ratios than female athletes. Overall, males had significantly lower 2D:4D ratios than females (0.98 ± 0.003 vs. 0.99 ± 0.004). A smaller 2D:4D ratio appears to be consistent with participation in varsity sports among both males and females. Research suggests that prenatal levels of testosterone are related to finger length development and traits beneficial to athletic skill, such as power, endurance, visual-spatial skills, or sensation seeking and dominance behavior. In men, the second digit to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) has been shown to correlate with success in competitive levels of football (soccer), which suggests that the 2D:4D ratio is a possible marker for level of attainment in sport.  Significant differences were found among the different groups (p = 0.000), with significantly lower ratios between football and crew (p = 0.000), football and nonathletes (p = 0.030), and gymnastics and crew (p = 0.001). This research provides a stronger level of evidence that the 2D:4D ratio may help indicate potential athleticism or competition-level achievement, but the external validity may be limited to only specific sports. Low 2D:4D has been linked to various measures of performance in a range of sports (e.g., soccer, rugby).  We found that right 2D:4D (but not left 2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches' ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30). It appears that in line with other sports that low right 2D:4D (high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen) correlates to high surfing ability in men. Compared with controls, players were larger and had lower 2D:4D for the right and left hand. With regard to number of caps, players with low 2D:4D in their right hand and low right 2D:4D compared with their left (right - left 2D:4D difference) had high numbers of caps. First-choice players did not differ significantly from second-choice players in their 2D:4D but they did have a lower right - left 2D:4D difference than second-choice players.  We conclude that low right 2D:4D and low right - left 2D:4D difference are predictors of high rugby performance. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a widely studied putative marker for masculinization through prenatal androgen exposure, is lower (more masculinized) in athletes than in general population controls, and athletes with lower 2D:4D have higher sporting success. Digit ratio (2D:4D) predicts sporting success among female fencers independent from physical, experience, and personality factors. Research particularly focusing on male athletes and popular sports (running and soccer) suggests associations of lower (masculinized) second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a putative marker of prenatal androgen action, with better sports performance.  Among female, but not male, fencers, lower 2D:4D was related to better national fencing rankings. Athletes active in the most aggressive form (the sabre) had lower 2D:4D than those active in the other forms (épée and foil fencing). Our results showed that elite female athletes have significantly lower left hand 2D:4D ratios compared to the control group (P<0.05). Therefore, we can speculate that low 2D:4D ratio may be a positive correlate of sports potential in females. Our results confirmed that both male (mean ± s(x) : 0.97 ± 0.004) and female (0.98 ± 0.005) varsity athletes had significantly lower ratios than their non-varsity peers (males: 0.99 ± 0.004; females: 1.00 ± 0.006), and that male athletes had significantly lower 2D:4D ratios than female athletes.

56c3104c50c68dd416000001	What is GDF10?	We have identified a new member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, growth/differentiation factor-10 (GDF-10), which is highly related to bone morphogenetic protein-3 (BMP-3). The nucleotide sequence of GDF-10 encodes a predicted protein of 476 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 52,000. The GDF-10 polypeptide contains a potential signal sequence for secretion, a putative RXXR proteolytic processing site, and a carboxy-terminal domain with considerable homology to other known members of the TGF-beta superfamily. In the mature carboxy-terminal domain GDF-10 is more homologous to BMP-3 (83% amino acid sequence identity) than to any other previously identified TGF-beta family member. GDF-10 also shows significant homology to BMP-3 (approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity) in the pro- region of the molecule. Based on these sequence comparisons, GDF-10 and BMP-3 define a new subgroup within the larger TGF-beta superfamily. By Northern analysis, GDF-10 mRNA was detected primarily in murine uterus, adipose tissue, and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen. In addition, GDF-10 mRNA was present in both neonatal and adult bone samples, with higher levels being detected in calvaria than in long bone. These results suggest that GDF10 may play multiple roles in regulating cell differentiation events, including those involved in skeletal morphogenesis. Gdf10 was mapped to the proximal region of mouse chromosome 14 close to a region known to contain a spontaneous recessive mutation that is associated with a craniofacial defect. Growth differentiation factor 10 (Gdf10), also known as Bmp3b, is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß superfamily Thus, we show for the first time, that Gdf10, expressed in Bergmann glial cells, is affected by the loss of Shh as early as E18.5, suggesting a regulation of glial development by Shh. These results suggest that GDF10 may play multiple roles in regulating cell differentiation events, including those involved in skeletal morphogenesis.

56c036afef6e394741000019	What causes erucism?	Erucism is a skin reaction to envenomation from certain poisonous caterpillar bristles. Although many tropical insects carry infectious diseases, cutaneous injury can occur by other mechanisms, for example erucism (envenomation by caterpillars) or lepidopterism (dermatitis from moths). We present a case of erucism (caterpillar dermatitis) in a British serviceman deployed in Croatia on Operation Resolute.  The hair on the dorsum of the last instar larvae of the moth may cause urticarial reactions (erucism) as well as eye problems and temporary blindness. In the South of Brazil during the last years caterpillars of this butterfly caused a great number of cases of erucism including some deaths.  Urticating moths (genus Hylesia and Anaphae) protect their eggs and young caterpillars with urticating hairs, thus it is very ambiguous to label erucism as the contact dermatitis produced by caterpillar production or Lepidopterism as the contact dermatitis caused by moth urticating hairs. Erucism is defined as urtication by Lepidoptera larvae.  Specific syndromes caused by Lepidoptera include erucism (cutaneous reactions from contact with caterpillars, moths, or cocoons), lepidopterism (systemic involvement), ophthalmia nodosa (ocular involvement), dendrolimiasis and pararamose (each with joint symptoms relating to a specific species of caterpillar), lonomism (a severe hemorrhagic disease related to Lonomia species), and seasonal ataxia (related to ingestion of Anaphe venata).

Ear acupressure (EAP) and ear acupuncture have been used for smoking cessation, and some positive results have been reported Auricular (ear) acupressure has been purported to be beneficial in achieving smoking cessation in some studies, while in others has been deemed insignificant Acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking and pressing has reliable therapeutic effect for smoking cessation Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking cessation. Combining ten studies showed auricular acupuncture at 'correct' points to be more effective than control interventions, odds ratio 2.24 (95% CI 1.61, 3.10), Auricular acupuncture appears to be effective for smoking cessation, but the effect may not depend on point location. The combination of auricular acupressure and Internet-assisted smoking cessation program was more efficacious than auricular acupressure alone in terms of quit rate. auricular acupuncture in smoking cessation has some effect. With a one-year success rate of 41.1% ear acupuncture is a competitive alternative to orthodox medicine withdrawal methods. Acupuncture treatment can be applied and adapted individually, furthermore it is economical and without side effects. Auriculotherapy is an useful aid for giving up smoking. It is easy and painless, has no secondary effects and it is economic. the combined acupuncture-education group showing the greatest effect from treatment. Acupuncture and education, alone and in combination, significantly reduce smoking; however, combined they show a significantly greater effect, as seen in subjects with a greater pack-year history. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of laser acupuncture treatment in adolescent smokers.  Thus, there was no significant difference in the rates of smoking cessation in the treatment and control groups. This simple ear electroacupuncture treatment was significantly more effective in helping volunteers to quit smoking than placebo treatment.

517151f28ed59a060a000008	What is the correlation between SPARC expression and growth inhibition in human cancer?	Using a chemical carcinogenesis model in Sparc-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates, we found that loss of SPARC accelerated the development of urothelial preneoplasia (atypia and dysplasia), neoplasia, and metastasis and was associated with decreased survival. Our studies showed that inhibition of HDAC decreased NB proliferation, and induced caspase activity and G1 growth arrest. Expression patterns of cancer-related genes were modulated by VPA. The expression of THBS1, CASP8, SPARC, CDKN1A, HIC1, CDKN1B, and HIN1 was upregulated, and that of MYCN and TIG1 was downregulated. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of SPARC inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation. Concomitantly, SPARC was upregulated in all ccRCC cells, suggesting that Ukrain could also affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition, as supported by the cell cycle analysis, as SPARC also acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. SPARC silencing in IM-R cells restored imatinib sensitivity, whereas enforced SPARC expression in imatinib-sensitive cells promoted viability as well as protection against imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Notably, we found that the protective effect of SPARC required intracellular retention inside cells We found that depletion of SPARC induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition with activation of p53 and induction of p21(Cip1/Waf1) acting as a checkpoint, preventing efficient mitotic progression. Knockdown of SPARC expression in H322 and A549 cells led to suppression of cell invasion, comparable to that observed in KLF4-transfected cells. Moreover, retrovirus-mediated restoration of SPARC expression in KLF4-transfected cells abrogated KLF4-induced anti-invasion activity. Together, our results indicate that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell invasion by suppressing SPARC gene expression. To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation In vivo experiments revealed that SPARC overexpression in HCC cells inhibited their tumorigenic capacity and increased animal survival through a mechanism that partially involves host macrophages. Our data suggest that SPARC overexpression in HCC cells results in a reduced tumorigenicity partially through the induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Finally, we demonstrated that SPARC, which has been previously associated with meningioma invasiveness, was increased in aggressive meningiomas. We found that the leukemic cells of AML patients with MLL gene rearrangements express low to undetectable amounts of SPARC whereas normal hematopoietic progenitors and most AML patients express this gene. SPARC RNA and protein levels were also low or undetectable in AML cell lines with MLL translocations. Consistent with its tumor suppressive effects in various solid tumor models, exogenous SPARC protein selectively reduced the growth of cell lines with MLL rearrangements by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. These data indicate that SPARC plays an essential role in tumor evasion from immune surveillance through the inhibition of the antitumor PMN activity. We conclude that SPARC is inhibitory to human breast cancer cell proliferation, and does not stimulate migration, in contrast to its stimulatory effects reported for melanoma (proliferation and migration) and glioma (migration) cells. Similar growth repression by SPARC has been reported for ovarian cancer cells, and this may be a common feature among carcinomas. Furthermore, SPARC delayed but did not inhibit tumor growth. The patterns of invasion and the extent of growth delay correlated with the level of SPARC expression.	['Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a multi-faceted protein-modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. SPARC seems to act as a tumour suppressor, as it has been found that loss of SPARC accelerates the development of certain types of cancer, whereas its expression impairs tumor growth. However it has also been associated with a aggressive phenotypes of some tumours. The role of SPARC may depend on its subcellular localization.']

5a9d8ffe1d1251d03b000022	What are pQTLs?	A genome-wide association study identifies protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). The identification of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) may be a powerful complementary method of improving our understanding of disease pathways.  Yet the impact of genetic variation, including eQTLs, on protein levels remains poorly understood. To address this, we mapped genetic variants that are associated with eQTLs, ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). We found that most QTLs are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. By studying the genetic variation affecting gene expression levels (cis expression quantitative trait loci [cis-eQTLs]) and protein levels (cis protein QTLs [cis-pQTLs]), we determined that young, primate-specific genes are enriched in cis-eQTLs and cis-pQTLs.  Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified seven genomic loci influencing fibrosis phenotypes (pQTLs) with genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4, 5, 7, 12, and 17. We observed enrichment of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cellular sensitivity to two commonly used chemotherapeutics: cisplatin and paclitaxel.  Here, we assayed the abundance levels of proteins in plasma from 96 elderly Europeans using a new aptamer-based proteomic technology and performed genome-wide local (cis-) regulatory association analysis to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). we describe a proteomic quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study of plasma proteome screens in an F(2) intercross of 455 mice mapped with 177 genetic markers across the genome.
