We have recently proposed a model in which chromatin remodeling by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein (JBP2) regulates the developmental and de novo site-specific localization of J synthesis within bloodstream form trypanosome DNA.JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes.The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases.Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis.  We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis.Two thymidine hydroxylases differentially regulate the formation of glucosylated DNA at regions flanking polymerase II polycistronic transcription units throughout the genome of Trypanosoma brucei.We have previously characterized two thymidine-hydroxylases (TH), JBP1 and JBP2, which regulate J-biosynthesis.JBP2 is a chromatin re-modeling protein that induces de novo J-synthesis, allowing JBP1, a J-DNA binding protein, to stimulate additional J-synthesis.JBP2 and JBP1 are capable of stimulating de novo J-synthesis.Chromosome-internal J deposition is primarily mediated by JBP1, whereas JBP2-stimulated J deposition at the telomeric regions. \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes.Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein.The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive.

{"id": "55451e53bf90a13052000003", "question": "Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?", "context": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions.Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription.the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP.We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription.NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesionBacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase.Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively.The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli.The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA.The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors.Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins.The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins.Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site.Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factorsMfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation.Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrAE. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation.We also find that the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAPWe show that Mfd-dependent TCR in bacteria involves the formation of a damage search complex that can detect lesions downstream of a stalled RNAP, and that the strand specificity of the accelerated repair pathway is independent of the requirement for a lesion to stall RNAPcoli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins", "answers": {"answer_start": [477, 1055], "text": ["Mfd", "NusA"]}}

{"id": "5523f1a62c8b63434a000002", "question": "Which mutations of phopspholamban have been found in patients with cardiomyopathy?", "context": " In 19 of 142 patients (13%), the PLN founder mutation c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) was identified. PLN mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (p = 0.004), inverted T waves in leads V4 to V6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (p = 0.007) or functional (p = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities.Recently, we showed that the c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) mutation in the phospholamban (PLN) gene can be identified in 10-15 % of Dutch patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients. The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC. R14del+ patients diagnosed with DCM showed an arrhythmogenic phenotype, and SCD at young age can be the presenting symptom. These findings support the concept of 'arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy'.Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients.To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse.Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling.Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart failure has been conducted.Two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L).One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). The fourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop).The genetic analysis was focused on R9C mutation with the ability to block PLN phosphorylation leading to chronic inhibition of SERCA2a activity. Another analysed mutation causing the alteration of PLN level in cells was related to the substitution of a leucine residue at position 39 with a premature stop codon (L39X). A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant. We identified 1 family with a deletion of arginine 14 in the PLN. Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic with congestive heart failure. Phospholamban R14 deletion results in late-onset, mild, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No homozygous individuals were identified. By middle age, heterozygous individuals developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases.Transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death.A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy.Here, a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. The heterozygous individuals exhibited hypertrophy without diminished contractile performance. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes.

The \"RAM\" region of NICD recruits Notch to CSL, facilitating the binding of MAML at the interface between the ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain of NICD and CSL.Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression.Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled.Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane. ICN then travels into the nucleus where it drives the assembly of a transcriptional activation complex containing the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL, ICN, and a specialized co-activator of the Mastermind family. A consensus DNA binding site motif for the CSL protein was previously defined using selection-based methods, but whether subsequent association of Notch and Mastermind-like proteins affects the DNA binding preferences of CSL has not previously been examined.We report here the crystal structure of a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing the ankyrin domain of human Notch1 (ANK), the transcription factor CSL on cognate DNA, and a polypeptide from the coactivator Mastermind-like-1 (MAML-1). Ligand binding by Notch receptors triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that liberate the intracellular portion of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane, permitting it to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex.On the basis of our results, we present a working structural model for the organization of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex.The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading.We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis.Mastermind (Mam) is a component of Notch pathway signaling. In combination with the intracellular domain of Notch and Suppressor of Hairless, Mam forms a transcriptional activation complex.High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member.This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA.This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNAHigh levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family memberNotchIC, together with the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind, form a ternary complex with CSL that activates transcription from genes that are responsive to Notch signalingNuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expressionNuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex", "answers": {"answer_start": [4, 32, 1038, 1067, 1226, 2120, 2132, 741, 764, 656, 1811], "text": ["Notch intracellular domain (NICD)", "NICD", "Intracellular part of Notch", "ICN", "Transcription factor CSL", "RBP-Jkappa", "CBF1", "Suppressor of Hairless", "Lag-1", "The coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1", "MAML-1"]}}

Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals. However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group. There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57.3%, P<0.004) in adrenal glands of obese mice. Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47.0%, P<0.005). Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected. Differential housing (single vs. group) and social defeat of rats is known to alter the activity of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the medulla. The present studies examined the effect of 70 days of triad (3 rats per large cage) and individual housing of male rats on adrenal mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and on TH protein levels.As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands. We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas.

However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results.RESULTS: We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation.mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads?mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 1773, 1789], "text": ["mmquant", "EMASE", "Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression"]}}

{"id": "52bf1af803868f1b06000008", "question": "Which diseases are caused by mutations in Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene?", "context": "Recessively inherited CPVT is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene. It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia. The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene. In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p.L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT. These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease. Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT.Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2).Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease. We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT. Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p.Y55C (c.164A>G) and p.P308L (c.923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene. A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT.Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations. We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles. The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias.Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT. Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias. These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT.This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT.An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu).

This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect. This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes.Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis.Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND) is a rare disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial, brain, and limb malformations, including frontonasal dysplasia, interhemispheric lipoma, agenesis of the corpus callosum, tibial hemimelia, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, and intellectual disability. Exome sequencing of one trio and two unrelated probands revealed the same heterozygous variant (c.3487C>T [p. Arg1163Trp]) in a highly conserved protein domain of ZSWIM6; this variant has not been seen in the 1000 Genomes data, dbSNP, or the Exome Sequencing Project. Sanger validation of the three trios confirmed that the variant was de novo and was also present in a fourth isolated proband. In situ hybridization of early zebrafish embryos at 24 hr postfertilization (hpf) demonstrated telencephalic expression of zswim6 and onset of midbrain, hindbrain, and retinal expression at 48 hpf. Immunohistochemistry of later-stage mouse embryos demonstrated tissue-specific expression in the derivatives of all three germ layers. qRT-PCR expression analysis of osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines available from two probands was suggestive of Hedgehog pathway activation, indicating that the ZSWIM6 mutation associated with AFND may lead to the craniofacial, brain and limb malformations through the disruption of Hedgehog signaling.A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C>T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations.Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis .A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.A single recurrent heterozygous missense substitution in ZSWIM6, encoding a protein of unknown function, was previously shown to underlie this disorder in four unrelated cases.", "answers": {"answer_start": [58, 250, 284], "text": ["Severe intellectual disability without frontonasal or limb malformations", "Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis", "AFND"]}}

It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.RESULTS uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively.Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs.These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology.METHODS: The uc.160 expression was examined in gastric cancer tissues and established cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay.RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1480, 3668], "text": ["Uc.160+", "Uc.416+A"]}}

It is available in fixed-dose combinations of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, 50/12.5/200, 75/18.75/200, 100/25/200, 125/31.25/200, 150/37.5/200 and 200/50/200 mg. Stalevo is currently approved for use in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose wearing off.Good news were marketing of ropinirole, a new non-ergot agonist, in December 2006 and entacapone, the first catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor in Japan in April 2007. Having faced these new situations, Japanese Neurological Association has started revising \"the Guideline 2002 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease\".Stalevo (Orion) combines levodopa, the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa and the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone in a single tablet.We investigated whether administration of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, alters the pharmacokinetics of apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients experiencing severe motor fluctuations.The catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone is given in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off.Entacapone (Comtess/Comtan) is Orion Pharma's original proprietary catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor. Entacapone is able to slow down degradation of levodopa and improve the availability and efficacy of each levodopa dose, hence its use as a complement to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease.Sleep attacks in Parkinson's disease induced by Entacapone, a COMT-inhibitor.We present a patient who suffered from sleep attacks after starting entacapone in addition to levodopa. Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, alters the pharmacokinetics of levodopa, leading to increase of levodopa concentration in plasma and brain.Two COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been made available as adjunctive agents to levodopaTwo inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been introduced as adjuncts to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients.Tolcapone, a peripheral and central COMT inhibitor, appears to be quite effective, producing a 47% reduction in 'off' time.. Entacapone, a purely peripheral COMT inhibitor with a lower potency than tolcapone, has also proved to be effective and has not been associated with liver damage, obviating the need for testing.Here we report that a treatment of the cerebral tissue with tolcapone, a central and peripheral inhibitor of COMT, does not change the membrane responses of midbrain dopamine neurons to dopamine and levodopa.Therefore, the therapeutic action of tolcapone in Parkinson's disease, might be dependent on the reduction of COMT activity in the extracerebral tissue.Pretreatment with entacapone (OR-611), a peripheral catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor, greatly reduces the plasma 3OMFD fraction and provides an ideal situation to evaluate the contribution of the plasma 3OMFD fraction in several kinetic models of FDOPA uptake.The novel and reversible inhibitors are the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitors, Ro 40-7592 (3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone), and the monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, Ro 19-6327 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-2-pyridine carboxamide HC1).", "answers": {"answer_start": [2190, 0], "text": ["tolcapone", "entacapone"]}}

CONCLUSION: Matuzumab 800 mg weekly combined with ECX chemotherapy does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced OG cancer.In all studies, the patients had different types of advanced carcinoma - mainly colon, rectal and pancreatic cancer. They received matuzumab as multiple 1-hour intravenous infusions in a wide range of dosing regimens (development dataset: from 400 mg every 3 weeks to 2000 mg in the first week followed by 1600 mg weekly; evaluation dataset: from 100 mg weekly to 800 mg weekly).

We recently published a phase I study of weekly matuzumab plus paclitaxel.Our data suggest that EGFR expression and KRAS mutation status is predictive for clinical response to matuzumab +/- paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC.Phase I study of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine plus matuzumab in previously untreated patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer.To evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the humanised antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) in patients as first-line treatment for advanced oesophagogastric cancer that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Therefore, these first successes led to the development of several drugs including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, panitumumab, matuzumab), TK inhibitors targeting one receptor as well as TK pan-inhibitors (lapatinib, HKI 272, PKI 166, EKB-569, AEE-788), currently assessed through clinical trials worldwide.Antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor in non small cell lung cancer: current status of matuzumab and panitumumab.Matuzumab and panitumumab are antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that are being evaluated in several malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In phase I trials of single-agent matuzumab in patients with EGFR-positive cancer, three tumor responses were documented in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well as colorectal carcinoma.A phase II trial of EMD72000 (matuzumab), a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies.CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated.

TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16), a GTPase-activating protein, is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of TBC1D16 in EOC remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression and prognostic significance of TBC1D16 in EOC and its relationship with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The tissue specimens included 156 histologically confirmed EOC and 30 normal ovarian tissues. The expression of TBC1D16 and VEGF was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the immunoreactive score was calculated with signal intensity and percentage of positive cells. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as \"high expression,\" compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). The Chi-square test showed that high TBC1D16 expression was related to advanced pT stages (P = 0.029), but not correlated with other clinical features. Moreover, the TBC1D16 expression was significantly higher in EOC specimens with low VEGF expression (P < 0.001). Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, high expression of TBC1D16 was significantly correlated with good overall survival (OS). In conclusion, TBC1D16 is a predictive marker for favorable prognosis of EOC.Epigenetic activation of a cryptic TBC1D16 transcript enhances melanoma progression by targeting EGFR.Metastasis is responsible for most cancer-related deaths, and, among common tumor types, melanoma is one with great potential to metastasize. Here we study the contribution of epigenetic changes to the dissemination process by analyzing the changes that occur at the DNA methylation level between primary cancer cells and metastases. We found a hypomethylation event that reactivates a cryptic transcript of the Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D16 (TBC1D16-47 kDa; referred to hereafter as TBC1D16-47KD) to be a characteristic feature of the metastatic cascade. This short isoform of TBC1D16 exacerbates melanoma growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. By combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified RAB5C as a new TBC1D16 target and showed that it regulates EGFR in melanoma cells. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells.Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as \"high expression,\" compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05).Expression of TBC1D16 Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer .Based on the immunoreactive score , TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as \" high expression , \" compared with normal ovarian tissues ( P < 0.05) .

Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the \"Stupp protocol\") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy. The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients with primary GBM were postoperatively treated with either radiation and concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ (Stupp protocol) (n = 154), or radiation followed by adjuvant TMZ (n = 37).Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. The treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by chemoradiation with the protocol of Stupp et al. Since the publication of a study by Stupp et al in 2005, which used a protocol of conventional fractionated irradiation with concomitant TMZ followed by standard TMZ for six cycles, many clinical studies in the People's Republic of China have demonstrated that such a treatment strategy has significantly improved efficacy with limited side effects for newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgery as compared with strategies that do not contain TMZ.Standard chemoradiotherapy as per the Stupp protocol, together with multimodal rehabilitation, resulted in substantial functional improvement within 6 weeks of initiation.BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma treated with BCNU wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the Stupp protocol.This is followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) according to the Stupp protocol. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status and low MGMT expression both were identified as positive prognosticators in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection and received Gliadel wafer implants followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant oral TMZ chemotherapy (the Stupp protocol).INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the incidence and impact of early post-chemoradiation (cRT) 'pseudoprogression' (PsPD) amongst glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with the current standard of care - 60 Gy conformal radiotherapy with concurrent low-dose temozolomide, followed by six cycles of high-dose temozolomide (the 'Stupp protocol'). In patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is no consensus on the sequential use of two existing regimens: post-operative Gliadel implantation into the surgical cavity and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide ('Stupp protocol'). We also screened for associations between the level of methylation of CpG sites and overall survival in a cohort of 50 patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (STUPP protocol). Surprisingly, less than half the patients having surgery received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. We analyzed MGMT methylation by methylation-specific PCR in 90 GBM patients from four Portuguese hospitals, uniformly treated with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp protocol).The current care standards for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consist, when feasible, in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, as described in the Stupp protocol. Moreover, there are no data concerning the effect of concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the STUPP protocol on the course ofMS in patients with coexisting glioblastoma.

The most serious clinical complication of the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency is the rarely observed neonatal icterus.

A single nucleotide change causing the substitution of proline for a conserved alanine residue in the carboxyl terminus of the goat muscle chloride channel (gCIC-1) was discovered.The nondystrophic myotonias are rare muscle hyperexcitability disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene or loss-of-function mutations in the CLCN1 genehe observed phenotype resembled congenital myotonia caused by CLCN1 mutations in goats and humans. Nondystrophic myotonias are characterized by muscle stiffness triggered by voluntary movement. They are caused by mutations in either the CLCN1 gene in myotonia congenita or in the SCN4A gene in paramyotonia congenita and sodium channel myotonias.Thomsen's and Becker's diseases are the most prevalent nondystrophic myotonias. Their frequency varies, according to different sources, from 1 : 100 000 to 1 : 10 000. Thomsen's myotonia is autosomal dominant, and Becker's myotonia is autosomal recessive. Both diseases result from mutations of the CLCN1 gene encoding chloride ion channels of skeletal muscles.Thomsen's (TM) and Becker's (BM) Myotonias are nondystrophic myotonias.

We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines.We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers.We detected Notch1 missense mutations in 8.3% of the tumors (only in the posterior fossa location and in case of 9q33-34 gain).Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis).Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome.In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome.Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we describe a new candidate gene isolated from array comparative genomic hybridization redundant 6qter deletions, DELTA Like 1 (DLL1), which is a ligand of NOTCH.Four genes causing a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease have been identified: DLL3 (SCDO1: MIM 277300), MESP2 (SCDO2: MIM 608681), LFNG (SCDO3: MIM609813) and HES7 (SCDO4). These genes are all essential components of the Notch signalling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Previously, only a single SCD-causative missense mutation was described in HES7. In this study, we have identified two new missense mutations in the HES7 gene in a single family,Here we have used autozygosity mapping to identify a mutation in a fourth Notch pathway gene, Hairy-and-Enhancer-of-Split-7 (HES7), in an autosomal recessive SCD family.Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals.Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously.Altogether 226 different JAG1 mutations have been described in association with AGS, including our novel 36 mutations.Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of JAG1 mutations result in AGS. These include total gene deletions, protein truncating, splicing and missense mutations which are distributed across the coding region of the gene. Here we present results of JAG1 mutation screening by SSCP and FISH in 105 patients with AGS. For these studies, new primers were designed for 12 exons. Mutations were identified in 63/105 patients (60%)We have screened 54 AGS probands and family members to determine the frequency of mutations in JAG1. Three patients (6%) had deletions of the entire gene. Of the remaining 51 patients, 35 (69%) had mutations within JAG1, identified by SSCP analysis. Of the 35 identified intragenic mutations, all were unique, with the exceptions of a 5-bp deletion in exon 16, seen in two unrelated patients, and a C insertion at base 1618 in exon 9, also seen in two unrelated patients.Analyses of many patients with cytogenetic deletions or rearrangements have mapped the gene to chromosome 20p12, although deletions are found in a relatively small proportion of patients (< 7%).

We have found that phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A (PKA) leads to an increase in the rate of Ca(2+) leak from Ca(2+)-loaded SR vesicles.PKG activity of cardiac myocytes was assessed by phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation determined by western blot. PLB is not a unique reporter for PKG activity since it is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an important role mediating apoptosis/necrosis during ischemia-reperfusion (IR).The onset of reperfusion increased the phosphorylation of Thr(17) site of phospholamban, without changes in total protein, consistent with an increase in CaMKII activity. We found that when activated, Akt interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr(17), the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIdelta site, whereas silencing Akt signaling, through the knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PLN at Thr(17). Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition.Dephosphorylated PLN tonically inhibits the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a), while phosphorylation at Ser16 by PKA and Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) relieves the inhibition, and this increases SR Ca(2+) uptake.

Bowtie extends previous Burrows-Wheeler techniques with a novel quality-aware backtracking algorithm that permits mismatches.We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.SOAP2 is a significantly improved version of the short oligonucleotide alignment program that both reduces computer memory usage and increases alignment speed at an unprecedented rate. We used a Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT) compression index to substitute the seed strategy for indexing the reference sequence in the main memory.We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory.Here, we propose a new base-calling algorithm, TotalReCaller, to achieve improved performance. A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach.To tackle this problem, a new alignment tool BWBBLE is introduced in this article. We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome.Seed-based algorithms are generally slow but robust, while Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based algorithms are fast but less robust. To have both advantages, we developed an algorithm FANSe2 with iterative mapping strategy based on the statistics of real-world sequencing error distribution to substantially accelerate the mapping without compromising the accuracy.Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment.In this paper, we propose a BWA-MT tool, evolved from BWA but supporting multi-thread computation, designed to fully utilize the underlying multi-core architecture of computing resources. By using multi-thread computation, BWA-MT can significantly shorten the time needed to generate an alignment for single-end read sequences.The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gapsAlthough the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment stepsWe implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g.Although the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment steps.", "answers": {"answer_start": [54, 306, 338, 578, 960, 1012, 1192, 1549, 2190, 2484, 2566], "text": ["Bowtie", "Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool", "BWA", "SOAP2", "Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment", "BWA-SW", "TotalReCaller", "BWBBLE", "FANSe2", "BWASW-PMR", "BWA-MT"]}}

Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome.Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs).Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises \u223c 1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTsWe find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6.The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway.Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanismRecent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity.Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome.

This finding reveals the importance of MEC-17 and \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in cortical development.NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an \u03b1-tubulin deacetylase.Moreover, \u03b1-tubulin acetylation levels of microtubules specifically extending into the terminal synaptic boutons are reduced in response to dTip60 HAT reduction.In this study, angiotensin II induced disassembly and deacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using RNA interference.These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced vascular remodeling.Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules.Alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic microtubule dynamics can be explained by impaired histone deacetylase 6 functionAddition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold).Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules.We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells.The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform.Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration.Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells.Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells.Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells.Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin", "answers": {"answer_start": [952, 976, 996, 1744], "text": ["MEC-17", "SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2)", "HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6)", "dTip60"]}}

{"id": "51656c94298dcd4e51000058", "question": "What is the inheritance pattern of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy? ", "context": ". Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait.Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance.The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers.compatible with X-linked inheritance formThe first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD.As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus.contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD.The STA gene encodes emerin and is one of the genes that is affected in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Although it has been reported that EDMD caused by the STA gene mutation is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance, the genotype-phenotype correlations, with special reference to cardiac manifestations, are not well defined.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a muscular disorder characterized by 1) early contracture of the elbows. Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles, 2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a humeroperoneal distribution, and 3) life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction block. Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy. The patient had no familial background of the disease. This patient might have a sporadic inheritance pattern with severe cardiac involvement.autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy,Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is characterized by the clinical triad of early onset contractures of elbows, Achilles tendons and spine, wasting and weakness with a predominantly humero-peroneal distribution and life-threatening cardiac conduction defects and/or cardiomyopathy. Two main types of inheritance have been described: the X-linked form is caused by mutations in the STA gene on locus Xq28 and the gene for the autosomal dominant form (LMNA gene) has been localized on chromosome 1q11-q23. Recently, mutations in this LMNA gene have been also found to be responsible for the less frequent autosomal recessive form of the disease.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by early contractures of elbows and Achilles tendons, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and a cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks which is life-threatening. Two modes of inheritance exist, X-linked (OMIM 310300) and autosomal dominant (EDMD-AD; OMIM 181350). EDMD-AD is clinically identical to the X-linked forms of the disease. Mutations in EMD, the gene encoding emerin, are responsible for the X-linked form.including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD,this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance.Seventeen families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) have been studied both by DNA sequencing and by emerin protein expression. Fourteen had mutations in the X-linked emerin gene, while three showed evidence of autosomal inheritance. Twelve of the 14 emerin mutations caused early termination of translation.One family presented a rare autosomal dominant variant of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another with X-linked recessive inheritance showed unusual intrafamilial variability.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is characterised by (1) early contractures of the Achilles tendons, elbows, and postcervical muscles, (2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a predominantly humeroperoneal distribution in the early stages, and (3) cardiomyopathy with conduction defects and risk of sudden death. Inheritance is usually X linked recessive but can be autosomal dominant.Tendon contractures may be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women.Since the disease was diagnosed in 3 brothers, the X-coupled recessive type of its inheritance is assumed. An opinion is advanced that the described form is a clinical variety of Emery-Dreyfus myodystrophy.Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS)the term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance.Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with proximal weakness in both the upper and lower limbs and X-linked scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy represent the same disorder.There is at least one other report of autosomal dominant transmission of this clinical picture, which had previously only been reported as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with X-linked recessive inheritance.", "answers": {"answer_start": [100, 1091, 3139], "text": ["X-linked", "autosomal dominant", "autosomal recessive"]}}

Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage.We discuss the pertinent physics of the intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the timescales of collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of biological systems, material science investigations, and the study of matter in extreme conditions.employment of \"exotic\" systems, such as the Free Electron LASER (FEL), that are expected to focus on the fundamental processes of life, following chemical reactions and biological processes as they happen, on unprecedented time and size scales.New data analysis approaches are outlined for the correlated fluctuations in fast WAXS, for protein nanocrystals just a few molecules on a side, and for the continuous x-ray scattering from a single virusResearch opportunities and techniques are reviewed for the application of hard x-ray pulsed free-electron lasers (XFEL) to structural biology. These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump--probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. The use of femtosecond exposure times, rather than freezing of samples, as a means of minimizing radiation damage is shown to open up new opportunities for the molecular imaging of biochemical reactions at room temperature in solutionNew opportunities for solving the phase problem for XFEL data are outlined. A summary of the latest results is given, which now extend to atomic resolution for nanocrystals. Possibilities for time-resolved chemistry using fast WAXS (solution scattering) from mixtures is reviewed, toward the general goal of making molecular movies of biochemical processes.Molecular imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers.The recent development of X-ray free-electron laser sources has created new opportunities for the structural analysis of protein nanocrystals.X-ray free electron lasers hold the promise of enabling atomic-resolution diffractive imaging of single biological molecules.The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales.In this paper we report room temperature X-ray diffraction data of PS II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort (< 50 fs) 9 keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac Coherent Light Source.High-resolution protein structure determination by serial femtosecond crystallographyWe applied serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals (less than 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer by 3 micrometers) of the well-characterized model protein lysozyme.X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. Here we recorded interpretable diffraction data from micrometer-sized lipidic sponge phase crystals of the Blastochloris viridis photosynthetic reaction center delivered into an X-FEL beamHere we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.Single mimivirus particles intercepted and imaged with an X-ray laserFemtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallographyHere we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes.These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources.With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules.X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially coherent pulses of X-ray radiation.Diffractive imaging using the intense and coherent beam of X-ray free-electron lasers opens new perspectives for structural studies of single nanoparticles and biomolecules.The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination.Where possible we also highlight areas that we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane protein structural biology community.X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) deliver short (<100 fs) and intense (\u223c10(12) photons) pulses of hard X-rays, making them excellent sources for time-resolved studies.Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals.In single-particle coherent x-ray diffraction imaging experiments, performed at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), samples are exposed to intense x-ray pulses to obtain single-shot diffraction patterns.The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the \"diffraction-before-destruction\" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals.Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).Ultrashort X-ray pulses from free-electron laser X-ray sources make it feasible to conduct small- and wide-angle scattering experiments on biomolecular samples in solution at sub-picosecond timescales.The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage destroys the sample.The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology.X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology.X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains largely unsolved.Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam.Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from x-ray free-electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data, or both.By combining serial nanocrystallography with x-ray free-electron laser sources in the future, it may be possible to produce molecular-resolution electron-density maps using membrane protein crystals that contain only a few hundred or thousand unit cells.Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the principle of collect and destroy.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1977], "text": ["molecular imaging"]}}

{"id": "52bf209303868f1b0600001a", "question": "What are the indications for alteplase?", "context": "In Japan, intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), was approved for an indication of ischemic stroke in 2005 on the basis of the results of a clinical trial with a unique dose of the drug (0.6 mg/kg). Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited.The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children.To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients. Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator improves outcomes in patients treated early after stroke but at the risk of causing intracranial hemorrhage.Intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is the only approved thrombolytic agent at present indicated for acute ischaemic stoke.This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from the manufacturer to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process. The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days. Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months.The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities.Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated.Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation. Alteplase is the first thrombolytic drug to be approved in France for the treatment of ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptom onset.However, the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke suggests that alteplase is the most promising treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.  To determine whether cryopreserved solutions of the thrombolytic agent alteplase could be used as a safe, effective, and economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in patients presenting with occluded central venous access devices (CVADs).Alteplase has been reported as an efficacious alternative to urokinase for treatment of occluded CVADs. Patients presenting with occluded CVADs received a sufficient volume of the thawed alteplase solution to fill the occluded catheter(s). Cryopreserved 1-mg/mL aliquots of alteplase are safe and effective in the clearance of occluded CVADs when stored at -20 degrees C for 30 days. The ability to cryopreserve alteplase aliquots makes it an economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in the setting of CVAD occlusion.Of the thrombolytic agents and therapeutic protocols in use, alteplase 100 mg/2 hours seems to be the best compromise between the risk of bleeding and efficacy in reducing pulmonary resistances by 30 to 40% and relatively early pulmonary revascularisation of 40-50%. To explore the best regimen of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism(APE), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-h infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, Alteplase (rt-PA) and urokinase(UK). A 2 h regimen of rt-PA or UK showed reliable efficacy and safety for treatment of APE. The indication of thrombolytic therapy can be extended.Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase.Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries. Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min.A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI. An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention. Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period.Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis. However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease.Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate. Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI.The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate.Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion. However, its use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as extensively documented. Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are scarce.Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism.The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA). In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients.Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not proven in a satisfactory manner. Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more readily than occlusive thrombi. For this indication the optimal dose regimens for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not established. To save 1 year of life, the costs of thrombolytic therapy using intravenous streptokinase, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) or anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex) under standard restricted indication criteria, vary from 1000 pounds British sterling to 1700 pounds British sterling in the UK, SEK3090 to 9660 in Scandinavia and $US35 000 to 800 000 in the US, depending on time delay in starting treatment after pain onset, size of infarct, thrombolytic agents used, study methodology, lists of clinical events considered in cost counting and the discount rate.Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis. Further studies are needed to define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication.Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension. The local treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively. More recently, new drugs like alteplase, reteplase, lanoteplase and saruplase have been a breakthrough in the treatment of acute myocardial infarctionThe non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA)The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in childrenSome acute ischemic strokes (before the 3rd hour) could be treated with alteplase if there is no absolute or relative contraindication for thrombolysis.Alteplase and reteplase are the most efficient thrombolytics despite a higher risk of cerebral bleeding.

Over the past decade, PADs and protein citrullination have been commonly implicated as abnormal pathological features in neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and rheumatoid arthritis. These findings suggest that PAD2 and citrullinated proteins may play a key role in the brain pathology of prion diseases. We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression. recent advances have shown that the once obscure modification known as citrullination is involved in the onset and progression of inflammatory diseases and cancer.These observations may reflect a role of P. gingivalis in the protein citrullination, which is related to the pathogenesis of RA.Protein citrullination has been detected in the CNS and associated with a number of neurological diseases.Protein and peptide citrullination are important in the development of rheumatoid arthritiscitrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Our data thus suggest that autoantibody formation in response to citrullinated vimentin directly induces bone loss, providing a link between the adaptive immune system and bone.citrullinated protein also has a negative side, because this protein's accumulation in the brain is a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of tobacco smoking on disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis patients and its relation to anti-cyclical citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies.It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullinationwe have reported pathological characterization of PAD2 and citrullinated proteins in scrapie-infected mice, aberrant citrullinated proteins could play a role in pathogenesis and have value as a marker for the postmortem classification of neurodegenerative diseases.We previously reported that abnormal protein citrullination by PAD2 has been closely associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and prion diseaseThis study suggests that accumulated citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 may function in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and serve as potential therapeutic targets.PTMs such as citrullination due to alterations of peptidylarginine deiminase activity or generation of RA-specific epitopes, should be considered as a trigger in tolerance break.Protein citrullination is an important posttranslational modification recognized by rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific autoantibodies.

This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients.The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome.In patients with Apert syndrome, the hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures. These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space. The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions and the neurovascular bundles. Two of the patients had Apert syndrome (syndromic craniosynostosis with symmetrical syndactyly) and two had polydactyly. The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle syndactyly mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed. In these 10 patients, a total of 53 web spaces were released, 49 of which involved osteotomies for complex syndactyly. Apert syndrome, characterised by craniosynostosis, craniofacial anomalies, and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits (cutaneous and bony fusion), has been associated with two canonical mutations in the FGFR2 gene (S252W, P253R) in the great majority of cases.

Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease.Congenital Cataracts Facial Dysmorphism Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome is a complex developmental disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and course of ophthalmologic abnormalities in congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome in a genetically verified group of 9 patients.Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder that occurs in an endogamous group of Vlax Roma (Gypsies; refs. 1-3). The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter.The CCFDN syndrome is a complex phenotype involving multiple systems, characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital cataracts, microcorneae, delayed early motor and intellectual development, hypogonadotrop hypogonadism, hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, and serious complications related to general anaesthesia. Developmental abnormalities include congenital cataracts and microcorneae, primary hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, impaired physical growth, delayed early motor and intellectual development, mild facial dysmorphism and hypogonadism. Para-infectious rhabdomyolysis is a serious complication reported in an increasing number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy. All patients showed a peripheral, demyelinating neuropathy and varying degrees of ataxia. In the older patients, muscular atrophy in distal muscles and facial dysmorphism was evident. Early-onset bilateral congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil could be found in all patients. All children had floppy eyelid syndrome and pseudoptosis.All patients had syndrome-associated nystagmus and congenital esotropia. Distant visual acuity could be classified as severe to moderate impairment, whereas near visual acuity was much better (mild to moderate impairment).Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder. Peripheral nerve abnormalities in the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome.Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a novel developmental disorder in Gypsies maps to 18qter.We propose to refer to the syndrome as congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN). The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy. Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a rare cause of parainfectious rhabdomyolysis.CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy.The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features.Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder.Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the diseaseThe major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter", "answers": {"answer_start": [267, 288, 1522], "text": ["congenital cataracts", "facial dysmorphism", "peripheral neuropathy"]}}

{"id": "56f3f0f02ac5ed1459000017", "question": "Which are the most widely used computational methods for the identification of CRMs (cis-regulatory modules)?", "context": "Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). However, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs.In this work we present CisMiner, a novel methodology to detect putative CRMs by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. CisMiner allows to perform a blind search of CRMs without any prior information about target CRMs nor limitation in the number of motifs. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets.To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method 'CPModule'the optimal choice of method varies depending on species and composition of the sequences in question. When discriminating CRMs from non-coding regions, those methods considering evolutionary conservation have a stronger predictive power than methods designed to be run on a single genome. Different CRM representations and search strategies rely on different CRM properties, and different methods can complement one another. For example, some favour homotypical clusters of binding sites, while others perform best on short CRMs. Furthermore, most methods appear to be sensitive to the composition and structure of the genome to which they are applied. CisMiner: genome-wide in-silico cis-regulatory module prediction by fuzzy itemset miningAdditionally, we make a number of new predictions on combinatorial regulation of these five key TFs with other TFs documented in TRANSFAC.Due to degeneracy of nucleotide content among binding site instances or motifs, and intricate &apos;grammatical organization&apos; of motifs within cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), extant pattern matching-based in silico motif search methods often suffer from impractically high false positive rates, especially in the context of analyzing large genomic datasets, and noisy position weight matrices which characterize binding sitesGenome-wide identification of cis-regulatory motifs and modules underlying gene coregulation using statistics and phylogeny.We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. It can identify &apos;orthologous&apos; CRMs without multiple alignments.These methods are problematic when binding sites are not well aligned in multiple alignments or when the number of input known motifs is large. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.", "answers": {"answer_start": [473], "text": ["fuzzy itemset mining"]}}

In an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of Escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress.Here, we compare the staining patterns observed in Bacillus subtilis using fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin.Ramoplanin probes may be better imaging agents than vancomycin probes because they yield clear staining patterns at concentrations well below their minimum inhibitory concentrations.Structures of the muraymycins, novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors.The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety.The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Rethinking ramoplanin: the role of substrate binding in inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis.Vancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect.The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation.The lantibiotic mersacidin has been previously reported to interfere with bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesisHere, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursorsThe analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster.Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant bacteria by a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic.LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasmThe fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin.Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affectedMersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatantMode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycinIncubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis.n contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics.Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ramoplanin.Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.Bacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium.This effect does not involve a change in the permeability of the cell wall by this drug and is consistent with the identification of D-alanine racemase as a target of D-cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation. The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria. Fosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc and alanine-alanine.In contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface.The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment.

These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene.Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB.Transcriptional activation of the virus inducible enhancer of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, IRFs and the architectural protein of the mammalian high mobility group I(Y) [HMG I(Y)].Here, we demonstrate that the first step in enhanceosome assembly, i.e. HMG I(Y)-dependent recruitment of NF-kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun to the enhancer, is facilitated by discrete regions of HMG I and is mediated by allosteric changes induced in the DNA by HMG I(Y) and not by protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and these proteins. However, we show that completion of the enhanceosome assembly process requires protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and the activators.Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP. The transcriptional coactivators CBP and P/CAF are required for activation of transcription from the IFN beta enhanceosome. We show that CBP and P/CAF acetylate HMG I(Y), the essential architectural component required for enhanceosome assembly, at distinct lysine residues, causing distinct effects on transcription.The transcriptional activity of an in vitro assembled human interferon-beta gene enhanceosome is highly synergistic. This synergy requires five distinct transcriptional activator proteins (ATF2/c-JUN, interferon regulatory factor 1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB), the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y), and the correct alignment of protein-binding sites on the face of the DNA double helix.In addition, we provide evidence that recruitment of the holoenzyme by the enhanceosome is due, at least in part, to interactions between the enhanceosome and the transcriptional coactivator CREB, cAMP responsive element binding protein (CBP). Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y).Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators.A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on the DNA helix.We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex (enhanceosome). This multicomponent complex includes at least three distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y).Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome.Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y).A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa BTranscriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBPTranscriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y)", "answers": {"answer_start": [2085, 24, 34, 513, 519], "text": ["NF-kappa B (p50/p65)", "ATF-2", "c-jun", "IRF-3", "IRF-7"]}}

Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants. Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection. Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions. Recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics to guide diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis.Palivizumab is effective in reducing RSV hospitalization in high risk patient groups. .CONCLUSION: Palivizumab was effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalization infection in CF patients.CONCLUSIONS: Among infants 29 to 32 weeks' gestation without chronic illness, palivizumab use was associated with reduced RSV hospitalizations but increased hospitalizations for bronchiolitis without RSV diagnosis.There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease.Eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis in a cohort of children with severe bronchiolitis.n 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated their recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis for children who are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. To investigate the potential impact of the more restrictive 2014 criteria on the eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis, we applied the 2012 and 2014 AAP recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis to a multicenter cohort of 2207 US children hospitalized for bronchiolitis.The decrease was largely driven by the restriction of eligibility to preterm infants with gestational age<29 weeks.To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting.Preventing RSV bronchiolitis in vulnerable infants: the role of palivizumab.Palivizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV is the only agent licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk children.OBJECTIVES Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is the only existent immunoprophylaxis therapy for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants (up to 2 years of age), particularly in those who meet high-risk criteria (preterm infants and/or those with bronchopulmonary or congenital heart disease).CONCLUSION Palivizumab provides cost-effective prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants.OBJECTIVE To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting.", "answers": {"answer_start": [295, 336, 390], "text": ["infants born before 29 weeks' gestation", "infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity", "infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease"]}}

A 21-gene (Oncotype DX\u00ae; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) recurrence score (RS) is prognostic for recurrence and predictive of chemotherapy benefit.We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors.Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes.Molecular tests such as the Oncotype DX(\u00ae) breast cancer test are proving to be more effective tools for individualized patient stratification and treatment planning than traditional methods such as patient demographic variables and histopathology indicators.Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.The oncotype DX\u00ae genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and treatment decisions.The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer.The 21-gene signature has been intensively studied and incorporated into major guidelines for treatment decision in early breast cancer.Among early-stage breast cancer patients who received Oncotype DX, we found low knowledge about many aspects of genomic recurrence risk testing.the gene expression signatures that define specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets, such as luminal A and B, basal, normal-like, and ERBB2+, and prognostic signatures including MammaPrint and Oncotype DX, predicted genomic instability in our samples. This remarkable congruence suggests a biological interdependence of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome.The Oncotype DX assay is one of the molecular tests that provide predictive and prognostic information to breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and node-negative disease. This study evaluates the association of Forkhead-box protein A1 (FOXA1) and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) expressions with Oncotype DX recurrences scores in 77 cases of patients with ER-positive node-negative breast carcinomas diagnosed at Indiana University.the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond to chemotherapy.The EWG found adequate evidence regarding the association of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with disease recurrence and adequate evidence for response to chemotherapy.EWG) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer.confirmed the clinical validity of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay, not only as a way to predict recurrence but also as a tool for determining therapeutic benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.Over several decades, investigators working through National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cooperative Groups have contributed to major advances in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer.Cooperative Group studies have contributed to the development of a molecular profiling test, Oncotype Dx, which identifies women who have an excellent prognosis with hormonal therapy alone.In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancerThe Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.78 women, treated for early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with 0-3 positive lymph nodes, whose medical records indicated they received Oncotype DX testing earlier.A retrospective chart review of 58 T1/T2, node-negative, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer patients that underwent Oncotype DX gene assay testing between January and December 2006 was performed.", "answers": {"answer_start": [473], "text": ["breast cancer"]}}

{"id": "550712739d0faaa527000008", "question": "Which mutations in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been found to be related to CPVT?", "context": "Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers.These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2.The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays. The S4153R mutation enhanced propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and reduced SOICR threshold but did not alter Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding, a common feature of other CPVT gain-of-function RYR2 mutations. We conclude that the S4153R mutation is a gain-of-function RYR2 mutation associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by both CPVT and atrial fibrillation.To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice.The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction. We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05).The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a \"leaky\" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT.A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6.We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.  Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias.We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals.RyR2 mutations suggested to cause defective Ca2+ channel function have recently been identified in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) affected individuals.

Somatic mutation of the EGFR signalling pathway is a prevalent mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (Nature 486(7404):532-536, 2012). If the human genome harbours variants that influence susceptibility of the EGFR pathway to oncogenic mutation, such variants could also be prognostic for cetuximab responsiveness. KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab. KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab. KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies.The EGFR-R497K polymorphism is a potential predictor for overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab based therapy in the palliative setting.Laboratories are increasingly required to perform molecular tests for the detection of mutations in the KRAS gene in metastatic colorectal cancers to allow better clinical management and more effective treatment for these patients. KRAS mutation status predicts a patient's likely response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab.KRAS mutation has been unambiguously identified as a marker of resistance to cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.  This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status.Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy.KRAS mutation is a dramatic example of single nucleotide polymorphism, which is able to identify a priori patients that could receive or not an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab. While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate.Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy.. This study suggests that TP53 mutations are predictive of cetuximab sensitivity, particularly in patients without KRAS mutation, and that TP53 genotyping could have a clinical interest to select patients who should benefit from cetuximab-based CT.A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line. KRAS genotyping was recently introduced as predictive biomarker, since only tumors carrying a wildtype were found to respond to treatment with panitumumab.", "answers": {"answer_start": [161, 277, 2617], "text": ["KRAS", "EGFR", "BRAF"]}}

We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (A\u03b2) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects. High A\u03b2 depg biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid deposition [imaged with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose metabolism (imaged with [(18)F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural atrophy (imaged by MRI).

We now exteCriteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent A\u03b2 burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that A\u03b2-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE Tol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging. The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance. We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects. By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls). In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights. The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several A\u03b2-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied A\u03b2-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between A\u03b2-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of A\u03b2-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing A\u03b2 content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition,is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD).

The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE \u03b54+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \u03b54- EMCI and \u03b54- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than \u03b54- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE \u03b54+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than \u03b54- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data alssitron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled A\u03b2 ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvid\u2122) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of A\u03b2. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high A\u03b2 affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of A\u03b2 in the brain. It was the (Abeta) plaque formation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and precedes the onset of dementia. Abeta imaging should allow earlier diagnosis, but clinical application is hindered by the short decay half-life of current Abeta-specific ligands. (18)F-BAY94-9172 is an Abeta ligand that, due to the half-life of (18)F, is suitable for clinical use. We thus studied the effectiveness of this ligand in identifying patients with AD.

Therefore, three microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206, were previously reported as alternative biomarkers for duchenne muscular dystConclusion: Results support the use of GLDH as a specific biomarker for liver injury in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Creatine kinase (CK) is generally used as a blood-based biomarker for muscular disease including DMD, but it is not always reliable since it is easily affected by stress to the body, such as exercise., albumin Cys34 undergoes thiol oxidation and these changes correlate with levels of protein thiol oxidation and damage of the dystrophic muscles. AWe show that plasma albumin oxidation reflects muscle dystropathology, as increased after exercise and decreased after taurine treatment of mdx mice.These data support the use of albumin thiol oxidation as a blood biomarker of dystropathology to assist with advancing clinical development of therapies for DMD.Among a selected set of potential biomarkers for cardiomyopathy (MMP9, BNP, GAL3, CRP, LEP, TNC, TLR4 and ST2) we validated ST2 as significantly elevated in the serum of DMD cardiomyopathy group (35,798 \u00b1 4884 pg/mL) compared to normal controls (9940 \u00b1 2680 pg/mL; p < 0.01; n = 6).Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) levels were found significantly increased in both DMD groups compared to controls (p < 0.01).Increased ST2 levels were found in serum of DMD subjects compared to healthy volunteers and further elevated in DMD subjects with cardiomyopathy.Interleukin 1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein (ST2) is a Potential Biomarker for Cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Extracellular dystrophy-associated miRNAs (dystromiRs) show dynamic patterns of expression that mirror the progression of muscle pathology in mdx mice. xpression of the myogenic miRNA, miR-206 and the myogenic transcription factor myogenin in the tibialis anterior muscle were found to positively correlate with serum dystromiR levels, suggesting that extracellular miRNAs are indicators of the regenerative status of the musculature.Our data revealed that miR-499 was significantly upregulated in all DMD patients, and true carriers (mothers), while 78 % of potential carriers (sisters) exhibited high levels of this miRNA.Similarly, miR-103a-3p showed an increase in the patients' families although to a lesser extent. On the other hand, miR-206 and miR-191-5p were significantly downregulated in the majority of the DMD patients and the tested female family members. MicroRNA miR-103a-5p and miR-208a followed a comparable trend in patients and mothers.OPN is a promising biomarker for muscle regeneration in dystrophic dogs and can be applicable to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.The serum OPN level was significantly correlated with the phenotypic severity of dystrophic dogs at the period corresponding to the onset of muscle weakness, whereas other serum markers including creatine kinase were not. Immunohistologically, OPN was up-regulated in infiltrating macrophages and developmental myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating muscle fibers in the dystrophic dogs, whereas serum OPN was highly elevated. OPN expression was also observed during the synergic muscle regeneration process induced by cardiotoxin injection.There were very good inverse correlations between the levels of these miRNAs, especially miR-206, and functional performances: high levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life. Moreover, by receiver operating characteristic curves analyses, we revealed that these miRNAs, especially miR-206, were able to discriminate DMD from controls.miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs in serum are useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and hence as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease. miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs are useful as non-invasive biomarkers for DMD.Furthermore, ADAMTS5 was found to be significantly elevated in human DMD patient serum. Emerging MRI biomarkers of myocardial function and structure include the estimation of rotational mechanics and regional strain using MRI tagging; T1-mapping; and T2-mapping, a marker of inflammation, edema and fat. Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|\u03c1| = 0.68-0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|\u03c1| = 0.63-0.73) and peroneals (|\u03c1| = 0.59-0.72) also showed strong correlations.Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function.Our results show that the serum levels of miR-30c and miR-181a increased 7- and 6-fold respectively in DMD patients (n = 21, 2-14 years, ambulant), and 7-fold in BMD patients (n = 5, 9-15 years) compared to controls (n = 22, 2-14 years).However, there was a trend towards higher levels of miR-30c in DMD patients with better preserved motor function according to various motor scales and timed tests. We propose miR-30c and miR-181a as reliable serum diagnostic biomarkers for DMD and BMD and miR-30c as a potential novel biomarker to assess disease severity in DMD.highlights novel mdx biomarkers (GITR, MYBPC1, HSP60, SIRT2, SMAD3, CNTN1).Furthermore, the five TFs ZNF362, ATAT1, SPI1, TCF12 and ABCF2, as well as the eight miRNAs miR-124a, miR-200b/200c/429, miR-19a/b, miR-23a/b, miR-182, miR-144, miR-498 and miR-18a/b were identified as playing crucial roles in the molecular pathogenesis of DMD.erein we examined the potential applicability of serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, myostatin (GDF-8) and follistatin (FSTN) as non-invasive biomarkers to distinguish between DMD steroid na\u00efve patients and healthy controls of similar age and also for carrier detection.Our data suggest that serum levels of MMP-9, GDF-8 and FSTN are useful to discriminate DMD from controls (p < 0.05), to correlate with some neuromuscular assessments for DMD, and also to differentiate between Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) patients.carbonic anhydrase 3, microtubule associated protein 4 and collagen type I alpha 1 chain decline rather constantly over time, myosin light chain 3, electron transfer flavoprotein A, troponin T, malate dehydrogenase 2, lactate dehydrogenase B and nestin plateaus in early teens.

J wave is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.The J wave may be a risk factor for SCA in patients with HCM.Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was the most common risk factor present (alone or in combination with other markers) in patients experiencing primary prevention interventions (17 of 26 [65%]).Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was most frequently associated with appropriate interventions.In conclusion, it is demonstrated that LGE has incremental value in addition to clinical risk factors for risk stratification and management of patients with HC.Fibrosis as detected by CMR should be evaluated as an additional risk factor to further delineate risk of SCD in carriers of an HCM causing mutation.Nonsustained VT was the only predictive risk factor (RF) for an appropriate ICD intervention in the PP (positive predictive value 22%, negative predictive value 96%).Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia seems to be the most predictive RF for appropriate device discharges. However, LGE was strongly associated with surrogates of arrhythmia and remained a significant associate of subsequent SCD and/or ICD discharge after controlling for other variables. If replicated, LGE may be considered an important risk factor for sudden death in patients with HCM.In conclusion, our cohort study results do not support LVOTO as an independent risk factor for SD in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.The appearance of a \"hump\" at the ST segment during exercise testing appears to be a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM. However, further studies are necessary to validate this finding in larger populations and to elucidate the mechanism of the appearance of the \"hump.\"The ICD is definitely indicated for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients with HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest with documented ventricular fibrillation, or experienced one or more episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia.A number of risk markers are used to assess the magnitude of risk, including family history of premature sudden death; extreme left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (> 30 mm) in young patients; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter electrocardiographic recording; unexplained (not neurally mediated) syncope, particularly in young patients; and blood pressure decrease or inadequate increase during upright exercise.Measured risk factors for sudden death included family history of sudden death, massive left ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, and unexplained prior syncope.The following risk factors were analyzed: 1) previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 2) family history of sudden cardiac death; 3) high-risk genetic mutations; 4) syncope; 5) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 6) hypotensive response to exercise; and 7) marked left ventricular hypertrophy.Family history of sudden death was associated with a positive predictive value of 25% for appropriate therapies, 40% for syncope and 50% for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value.

{"id": "5506e2ff8e1671127b00000d", "question": "Which are the subunits of the IkB protein kinase (IKK)?", "context": "NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) associates with catalytic subunits IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 to form the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex and is a key regulator of NF-\u03baB pathway signaling.All known NF-\u03baB activators converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex to activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits (IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2) and a regulatory subunit NEMO/IKK\u03b3 that regulates the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, whereas IKK\u03b1 regulates the non-canonical pathway. The IKK protein complex is comprised of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and NEMO subunits, with IKK\u03b2 thought to play the dominant role in modulating NF-\u03baB activity. The I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex plays a crucial role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB by phosphorylating an inhibitory molecule I\u03baB\u03b1. Recently, we showed that IKK2 (also called IKK\u03b2), a catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, induces immunoglobulin E-mediated degranulation in mast cells by phosphorylating SNAP-23, the target-membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE).The depletion of any of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF\u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b3/NEMO), each of which is essential for the canonical NF\u03baB activation pathway, limits autophagy induction by physiological or pharmacological triggers, while constitutive active IKK subunits suffice to stimulate autophagy. NF-\u03baB activation is tightly regulated by the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, and a regulatory subunit IKK\u03b3/NEMO.Activation of the classical NF-\u03baB pathway is mediated through the activity of the IKK kinase complex, which consists of a heterotrimer of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3 subunits. NF-kB is a key regulator of inflammation and immunity in cancer development. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3. Activation of NF-\u03baB involves the I\u03baB kinase (IKK)-complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, and a regulatory scaffold protein, IKK\u03b3.The IKK kinase complex is the core element of the NF-kappaB cascade. It is essentially made of two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKgamma.Additional components may exist, transiently or permanently, but their characterization is still unsure.Activation of NF-kappaB subunits is regulated by the upstream IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex which contains IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma; the latter also known as NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO).Proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation requires the IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO).Inhibition of NF-kappaB by suppressing the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway, for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKK1, IKK2 and NEMO) triggers apoptosis in such cells. The IkappaB-Kinase (IKK) complex is a multisubunit protein complex crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB proteins and thus controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions.Activation of a large multisubunit protein kinase, called the inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, is central to the induction of the family of transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB. IKK is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory IKKgamma subunit.The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3", "answers": {"answer_start": [2163, 68, 2960, 2176, 77, 813, 2216, 395, 0], "text": ["IKKalpha", "IKK\u03b1", "IKK1", "IKKbeta", "IKK\u03b2", "IKK2", "IKKgamma", "IKK\u03b3", "NEMO"]}}

In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development.Emerging data suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1 by IHC have improved clinical outcomes with anti-PD-1-directed therapy, but the presence of robust responses in some patients with low levels of expression of these markers complicates the issue of PD-L1 as an exclusionary predictive biomarker. The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cellsit is not clear whether expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response. In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologic features, such as the composition and amount of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status.PD-L1 expression is likely an imperfect predictive biomarker for patient selection and association with other markers of the tumor immune microenvironment will be probably necessary in the future.Taking this data in account, PD-L1 overexpression could not be currently considered a robust biomarker to tailor the immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment.Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. IHowever in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to be confirmed by larger studies.. Although the most studied biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable.PD-L1: a novel prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination.Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of CM aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects.Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose. We question the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker in gastroesophageal cancers, as there are fundamental differences in PD-L1 expression between NSCLC and gastroesophageal cancers.PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC.Breaking the biomarker code: PD-L1 expression and checkpoint inhibition in advanced NSCLC.PD-L1 Expression in Carcinosarcomas of the Gynecologic Tract: A Potentially Actionable Biomarker.Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer.This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker.Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges.", "answers": {"answer_start": [818, 1055], "text": ["low levels of expression", "variable detection antibodies"]}}

Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions.Identification of a Tibetan-specific mutation in the hypoxic gene EGLN1 and its contribution to high-altitude adaptation.Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion).The estimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (\u223c8,400 years ago).

HMOX2 Functions as a Modifier Gene for High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetans.In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans. Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism.Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population. Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration.Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese.

In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode.The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations.Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data. Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data. In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data. One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of sequencing a genome. This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted. To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e.g. FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain). Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained.In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.We describe CSAM (Compressed SAM format), a compression approach offering lossless and lossy compression for SAM files.GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 1055, 2373, 3107, 3886], "text": ["GeneComp", "NGC", "SAMZIP", "QVZ", "CSAM"]}}

To date few comparative studies have been carried out to investigate the difference of genome editing characteristics between CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has overtaken TALENs as the tool of choice for most research groups working in this field, we hypothesized that there could be certain applications whereby the application of TALENs would have specific benefits.

We found that paired Cas9 nucleases induced targeted genomic deletion more efficiently and precisely than two TALEN pairs. However, when concurrently supplied with a plasmid template spanning the two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within EGFP, TALENs stimulated homology directed repair (HDR) more efficiently than CRISPR/Cas9 and caused fewer targeted genomic deletions.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the choice of genome editing tool should be determined by the desired genome editing outcome.

{"id": "5156be75d24251bc05000088", "question": "Which diseases is microRNA 132 (miR-132) implicated in?", "context": "Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays.Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNA are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy.Inflammation, stress signalling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted.Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes a chronic immuno-inflammatory response in the eye that may result in corneal neovascularization during blinding immunopathological lesion stromal keratitis (SK). miR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that is induced in endothelial cells in response to growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17.The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease. Manipulating miRNA expression holds promise as a therapeutic approach to control an ocular lesion that is an important cause of human blindness.Role of miR-132 in angiogenesisThe cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identified 26 genes up-regulated in schizophrenia subjects.Our data suggest miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia.Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD.Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice.Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments.Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis.Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases.The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus.

We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC.Previous work has shown that activin, a TGF(beta+) signaling molecule, permits pancreas development by repressing expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules that antagonize pancreas development. Here we show that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another hedgehog family member, and Patched 1 (Ptc1), a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity, are expressed in pancreatic tissue.The original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh). Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule of the hedgehog family known to play important roles in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, cortical bone formation, and the development of joints.Hedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) bind to Patched family receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2) to transduce signals to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3.

Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by mRNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity.Conclusions: Consistent with the function of the IFT-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core IFT-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of IFT-B components.Defects in USH2A cause both isolated retinal disease and Usher syndrome (ie, retinal disease and deafness). To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073 G>A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156 G>A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3 T>A; and c.12575 G>A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting.Null mutations in the ABHD12 gene lead to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease including polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract. Our study allowed us to report 5 new mutations in ABHD12. This is the first time missense mutations have been described for this gene. Furthermore, these findings are expanding the spectrum of phenotypes associated with ABHD12 mutations ranging from PHARC syndrome to a nonsyndromic form of retinal degeneration.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 1131, 2197, 4120], "text": ["DYNC2H1", "IFT81", "USH2A", "ABHD12"]}}

Microsatellite analysis was performed to confirm monozygosity and bi-parental inheritance of the X chromosome. Hypophosphatemia due to isolated renal phosphate wasting is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Two new genes linked to two different forms of hereditary hypophosphatemias have recently been described. Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein.Somatic and germline mosaicism for a mutation of the PHEX gene can lead to genetic transmission of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets that mimics an autosomal dominant trait.Familial hypophosphatemic rickets is usually transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder (XLH), although autosomal dominant forms have also been observed. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively.Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait. Somatic and germline mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal dominant inheritance.We report two cases of x-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets involving a man and his daughter.

These findings provide the convincing evidence for the first time that the upregulation of miR-203 may serve as a novel molecular marker to predict the aggressive tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis of EOC patientsSome, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissuesThere was a significantly positive correlation between miR-200a and E-cadherin in EOC. The biphasic expression pattern suggested that miR-200a levels may serve as novel biomarkers for the early detection of EOC, and miR-200a and E-cadherin are candidate targets for the development of new treatment modalities against ovarian cancerKaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0.05).

Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.Results: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.Availability and implementation: The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/.MobiDB: a comprehensive database of intrinsic protein disorder annotations.Disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous processes within an organism and to the determination of a protein's biological role. The most common source for protein disorder annotations, DisProt, covers only a fraction of the available sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures. Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding the content provided by already existing sources. In addition to the DisProt and PDB X-ray structures, we have added experimental information from NMR structures and five different flavours of two disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit manual annotations through a submission form. MobiDB features experimental annotations for 17 285 proteins, covering the entire PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database, with 565 200 annotated sequences.

Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations.RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus. In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined. Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks. Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases. Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events. The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor. Severity of ID ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders. Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia.CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants. Larger investigations will better define the prevalence of epilepsy, the epileptic phenotype, and syndromic features underlying GRIA3 variants.Missense variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are intracellular proteins which regulate voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the brain and other tissues. FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 1638, 1643], "text": ["GRIA3", "FHF2", "FGF13"]}}

{"id": "530cefaaad0bf1360c000003", "question": "What are the names of anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that is used for treatment of multiple sclerosis patients?", "context": "Alemtuzumab offers induction strategy for very active relapsing MS patients who have failed conventional therapy, and possibly selected treatment-naive patients.Differential reconstitution of T cell subsets following immunodepleting treatment with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 mAb) provides long-lasting disease activity suppression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, increased the risk of thyroid dysfunction in CAMMS223, a phase 2 trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a), in treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFN\u03b2-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the CD52 protein present at high levels on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. In clinical trials, alemtuzumab has shown a clinical benefit superior to that of interferon-\u03b2 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.These results potentially help explain the level of immunocompetence observed in alemtuzumab-treated MS patients.Alemtuzumab was first used in multiple sclerosis in 1991. It is a monoclonal antibody which is directed against CD52, a protein of unknown function on lymphocytes. Against an active comparator and the current first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (interferon-beta), alemtuzumab showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate as well as a significant reduction in the accumulation of disability. Alemtuzumab (previously known as Campath(\u00ae)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes that results in lymphopenia and subsequent modification of the immune repertoire. Compared to interferon beta-1a, alemtuzumab reduced the relapse rate by 49%-74% (P < 0.0001), and in two studies it reduced the risk of sustained disability accumulation by 42%-71% (P < 0.01). In one study (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis; CARE-MS1), there was no significant difference compared to interferon, perhaps reflecting the surprisingly low frequency of disability events in the comparator group.Alemtuzumab has been submitted for licensing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States and Europe.Alemtuzumab was associated with a greater chance of improved contrast sensitivity in patients with RRMS and may delay the worsening of visual function. The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduced disease activity in a phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab's consistent safety profile and benefit in terms of reductions of relapse support its use for patients with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, benefit in terms of disability endpoints noted in previous trials was not observed here. Alemtuzumab, formally known as Campath-1H, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a protein on the surface of lymphocytes and monocytes with unknown function. A single dose of alemtuzumab leads to a rapid, profound and prolonged lymphopenia. A Phase II trial has shown that alemtuzumab reduces the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability by over 70% compared with interferon beta in patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).Alemtuzumab, targeting CD52 expressed on T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and macrophages, has also shown to be effective in early RRMS and phase III trials are currently ongoing. monoclonal antibody therapy has provided the opportunity to rationally direct the therapeutic intervention by specifically targeting mechanisms of the immune system such as CD52 (alemtuzumab), CD25 (daclizumab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and CD20 (rituximab)Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, a broadly expressed cell surface molecule on immune cells.Alemtuzumab-treatment of MS patients with relapsing-remitting forms of the disease significantly reduced the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability compared to interferon \u03b2-1a treatment in a phase II trial. Alemtuzumab (CD52-specific humanized monoclonal antibody) was found to be an effective therapy for treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab effectively reduced relapse rates and improved clinical scores in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis not controlled by interferon therapy.Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody with remarkable efficacy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduces disease activity in previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. For patients with first-line treatment-refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab could be used to reduce relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability. Campath-1H causes the immune response to change from the Th1 phenotype, suppressing multiple sclerosis disease activity, but permitting the generation of antibody-mediated thyroid autoimmunity.Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation.Campath 1-H (Alemtuzumab) is a humanised monoclonal antibody which targets the CD52 antigen, a low molecular weight glycoprotein present on the surface of most lymphocyte lineages, causing complement mediated lysis and rapid and prolonged T lymphocyte depletion. Following encouraging initial data from other centres we report our open label experience of using Campath 1-H as a treatment in aggressive relapsing multiple sclerosis in a consecutive series of 39 highly selected patients treated across three regional centres and followed for a mean of 1.89 years.Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on lymphocytes and monocytes, may be an effective treatment for early multiple sclerosis. In patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab was more effective than interferon beta-1a but was associated with autoimmunity, most seriously manifesting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura.Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, is a highly promising agent currently being studied in two phase III clinical trials. In this review, data from the recently published phase II clinical trial in the treatment of early relapsing remitting MS is summarized and analyzed in light of the development of alemtuzumab for MS and its potential role in treating this disease is discussed.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52, an antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant lymphocytes. It is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. To assess the effect of systemic lymphocyte depletion on disease activity, seven patients with MS received a 10-day intravenous course of the humanised monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CDw52).The effect of CAMPATH-1H on disease activity provides direct, but preliminary, evidence that disease activity in MS depends on the availability of circulating lymphocytes and can be prevented by lymphocyte depletion.The elective treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis, using a humanized anti-leukocyte (CD52) monoclonal antibody (Campath-1H), has illuminated mechanisms that underlie the clinical course of the disease. Alemtuzumab is currently under review to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, based on positive Phase II and Phase III trials in both treatment-na\u00efve and treated relapsing MS patients. Alemtuzumab has recently been approved by the European authorities for active relapsing MS, in essence as a first-line agent.Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52.

The zoonotic bacterium Corynebacterium ulcerans may be pathogenic both in humans and animals: toxigenic strains can cause diphtheria or diphtheria-like disease in humans via diphtheria toxin, while strains producing the dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase D may lead to caseous lymphadenitis primarily in wild animals. Diphtheria toxin-positive Corynebacterium ulcerans strains have been isolated mainly from cattle, dogs and cats.Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria, has been performed. Corynebacterium ulcerans 0102 carries the gene encoding diphtheria toxin on a prophage different from the C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 prophage.Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin. Acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of C. ulcerans and C. diphtheriae. Corynebacterium ulcerans (toxigenic C. ulcerans) produces the diphtheria toxin, which causes pharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria-like disease in people, and this bacterium is commonly detected in dogs and cats that are reared at home.

In an effort to understand the physiological role of one of the CHD members in a mammalian model system, we developed a mutant mouse model for the Chd2 gene.Crystal structure of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) DNA-binding domain in complex with DNA.Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. In suvh4 suvh5 suvh6 and cmt3 mutants, H3K9me2 associated with lacO repeats is diminished, but homologous pairing persists.Mutations in CHD7, the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, are present in 60-80% of individuals with the CHARGE syndrome.Chromodomain is present in the integrase structures of blastopia and 412 subgroup LTR-retrotransposons and may facilitate the process of non-specific integration.The CHARGE syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome that usually results from deletion or heterozygous loss of function mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene at 8q12.1.A causative mutation within the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 gene, which plays an important role in the embryonic development, is present in 2/3 of affected patients.CHD1 is a subfamily member of the CHD family, which possesses a chromodomain, a helicase domain, and a DNA-binding domain.The chromatin organizer modifier domain (chromodomain) is present in proteins that contribute to chromatin organization and mediates their binding to methylated histone H3.Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory.Here we identify the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) as a novel coregulator of androgen-responsive transcription.Mutations in CHD7, a chromodomain gene, are present in a majority of individuals with CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly disorder characterized by ocular Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia and Ear anomalies.Two new chromodomain-containing proteins that associate with heterochromatin in Sciara coprophila chromosomes.Both proteins, ScoHET1 of 37 kDa and ScoHET2 of 44 kDa, display two chromodomain motifs that contain the conserved residues essential for the recognition of methylated histone H3 at lysine 9.In this study, we present a detailed histomorphologic characterization of mice containing a mutation in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (Chd2).Specificity of the chromodomain Y chromosome family of chromodomains for lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs.Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail.In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2.The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo.We assessed mRNA transcript abundance of seven genes that code for proteins with established roles in epigenetically-mediated gene silencing [transcriptional co-repressor SIN3A, DNA (cytosine-5-) methyltransferase 1, methyl CpG binding protein 2, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, histone binding protein rbbp4, histone deacetylase 1 and nuclear receptor co-repressor 2] using qRT-PCR.CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes.The cysteine-rich CXXC domains of MBD1 bound to Ring1b and the chromodomain of hPc2.Methylation of lysine 9 within histone H3 and the subsequent binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are thought to initiate heterochromatin formation in vivo and to propagate a heterochromatic state lasting through several cell divisions.Here, we show that the SNF2-like chromodomain helicase protein CHD8 interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF. CThe chromodomain (CD) of the Drosophila Polycomb protein exhibits preferential binding affinity for histone H3 when trimethylated at lysine 27.Despite a high degree of conservation, the Cbx chromodomains display significant differences in binding preferences.Three-dimensional solution structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43.Recently, three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs) have been identified in cpSRP43.The C-terminal helical segment typically found in the nuclear chromodomains is absent in CD1.Critical comparison of the structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43 with those found in nuclear chromodomain proteins revealed that the diverse protein-protein interactions mediated by the CDs appear to stem from the differences that exist in the surface charge potentials of each CD.Characterization and functional analysis of CReMM, a novel chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein.The present study describes a newly identified protein named CReMM (chromatin-related mesenchymal modulator). The protein was studied by bioinformatic means and classified as a member of the third subfamily of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD). In silico translation defined CReMM as a multiple domains protein including two chromodomains, SNF2/ATPase, helicase C domain and an A/T-DNA-binding domain (DBD).Identification and analysis of chromodomain-containing proteins encoded in the mouse transcriptome.The chromodomain is 40-50 amino acids in length and is conserved in a wide range of chromatic and regulatory proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. Chromodomain-containing proteins can be classified into families based on their broader characteristics, in particular the presence of other types of domains, and which correlate with different subclasses of the chromodomains themselves.Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions.In addition to the canonical MYST HAT catalytic domain, both TgMYST-A and -B possess an atypical C2HC zinc finger and a chromodomain.Clr7 and Clr8 are required for localization of the Swi6 chromodomain protein and for histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, thereby influencing not only mating-type switching but also transcriptional silencing in all previously characterized heterochromatic regions, chromosome segregation, and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region.MRG15, a novel chromodomain protein, is present in two distinct multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional activation.MRG15 is a novel chromodomain protein that is a member of a family of genes related to MORF4. MORF4 (mortality factor on chromosome 4) induces senescence in a subset of human tumor cell lines.Analysis of deletion mutants of MRG15 indicated that the leucine zipper at the C-terminal region of MRG15 was important for the protein associations in MAF1 and that the N-terminal chromodomain was required for the assembly of the MAF2 protein complex. Consistent with these data was the fact that a histone acetyltransferase activity associated with MRG15 was lost when the chromodomain was deleted and that both mutant MRG15 proteins failed to activate the B-myb promoter. The various mechanisms by which MRG15 could activate gene transcription are discussed.The chromodomain (CD) is a highly conserved motif present in a variety of animal and plant proteins, and its probable role is to assemble a variety of macromolecular complexes in chromatin.Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tail.The chromodomain of the HP1 family of proteins recognizes histone tails with specifically methylated lysines. Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing.

{"id": "5a7636d39e632bc066000004", "question": "Which R packages have been developed for the discovery of mutational signatures in cancer?", "context": "signeR: an empirical Bayesian approach to mutational signature discovery.Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: signeR is implemented in R and C ++, and is available as a R package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/signeRCancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition.Results: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.Availability: All tools developed in this paper have been implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation.Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \"mutation signatures\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \"mixed-membership models\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.

It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly.PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants.Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants.In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

Therefore, goiter is a common symptom. Hypoplasia of the cochlea is another feature.If a child has progressive sensorineural deafness and a widened vestibular aqueduct, it is important to consider a diagnosis of Pendred syndrome. Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, Pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syndrome results from various mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene that cause production of an abnormal pendrin proteinPendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. It is caused by mutations in the PDS gene. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome.Aside from the branchio-otorenal syndrome, Pendred syndrome is the only other known genetic disorder with a widened vestibular aqueduct.The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and sonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis in association with sensorineural hearing loss.Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture.Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and widened vestibular aqueducts are characteristic features of Pendred's syndrome, which provides the opportunity to diagnose Pendred's syndrome clinically in the first few years of life, as has recently been suggested in a case report (Cremers et al., Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and a widend vestibular aqueduct in Pendred syndrome, Arch.Pendred syndrome is the most common syndromal form of deafness, yet the primary defect remains unknown.Pendred syndrome is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment.The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and ultrasonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis (elevated TSH, low T4/fT4, goitre or normal thyroid volume) in association with sensorineural hearing loss.

However, no homologues of Ndc1p had been characterized in metazoa. Here, we identify and analyze NDC1 homologues that are conserved throughout evolution. We show that the overall topology of these homologues is conserved. Each contains six transmembrane segments in its N-terminal half and has a large soluble C-terminal half of approximately 300 amino acids.Although it is not known whether vertebrate NDC1 protein localizes to nuclear pores like its yeast counterpart, the human homologue contains three FG repeats in the C-terminus, a feature of many nuclear pore proteins.we bring together data from another study to demonstrate that the human homologue of NDC1 is the known inner nuclear membrane protein, NET3.The conserved transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoansgp210 is a major constituent of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) with possible structural and regulatory roles.

This nucleoporin contains a large cisternal N-terminal domain, a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and a single transmembrane segment.We propose that gp210 is organized into the pore membrane as a large array of gp210 dimers that may constitute a luminal submembranous protein skeleton.Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently produce autoantibodies against gp210, an integral glycoprotein of the nuclear pores. this protein consists of three main domains: a large glycosylated lumenal domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail.Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis frequently develop autoantibodies directed to gp210, a major glycoprotein of the nuclear pore complex.

Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis.Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively.

Finally, several studies were presented on new drugs with new therapeutic targets, such as vedolizumab, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We review the role of vedolizumab, a humanized antibody against the \u03b14\u03b27 - integrin, in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Results from clinical trials show that vedolizumab is effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in active CD and UC and has a very good safety profile.Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.NCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52.

This article reviews the emerging data on the use of vedolizumab for UC.  Newer treatments such as vedolizumab and tofacitinib may represent valuable future therapies.SUMMARY: New therapeutic targets in IBD patients who failed anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy are urgently required, and tofacitinib, vedolizumab and ustekinumab appear to be the most promising drugs. BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab, a gut-selective, anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody, has shown preliminary efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks had an adverse event profile similar to that previously observed. Mean disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score) improved with all 3 doses investigated.The new drugs discussed here are those that disturb lymphocyte homing to the gut (natalizumab, vedolizumab and anti-mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule); one that blocks interleukin (IL)-12 as well as the IL-23/T helper 17 (Th17) axis (ustekinumab) and one that blocks the signaling of multiple cytokines (tofacitinib).Vedolizumab  for Crohn's disease.AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the potential role of vedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, for the treatment of CD. All randomised placebo-controlled trials that evaluated vedolizumab for the treatment of CD were reviewed and safety and efficacy data evaluated. EXPERT OPINION: Vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated drug that is an important advance for the treatment of CD.Treatment strategies that appear particularly appealing include selective anti-integrin therapy with vedolizumab (anti-\u03b14\u03b27), etrolizumab (anti-\u03b27 antibody) and PF-00547,659 (anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody), anti-interleukin 12/23p40 therapy with ustekinumab and Janus kinase 1, 2 and 3 inhibition with toafacitinib.We discuss a number of them with specific focus on vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha4beta7 integrin on lymphocytes, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, and tofacitinib, a small molecule targeting Janus-activated kinase. Most likely, these three agents will find their way to the market and offer significant therapeutic alternatives for the management of Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis.Natalizumab, vedolizumab, alicaforsen AJM300, rhuMAb \u03b27, CCX282-B, and PF-00547,659 are few of monoclonal antibodies that have shown high promise in trials with the potential for more attractive benefit:risk ratio than currently available therapies.Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.Here, we discuss the current treatment options available for patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the history of CAM inhibitors, the current state of development of vedolizumab and its future role in inflammatory bowel disease, if approved by regulatory agencies.Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab.Several antibodies exist which constitute selection adhesion molecule inhibitors, including Natalizumab, MLN-0002 (Vedolizumab) and ISIS 2302 (Alicaforsen) will be discussed in this review.Vedolizumab for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled phase 2 dose-ranging study.BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic that has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).They are anti CD4+ T cell cytokine including interleukin (IL)-12/23 and IL-17 blockers, selective anti-adhesion molecule known as natalizumab, vedolizumab and alicaforsen, T-cell proliferation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory cytokine, immune stimulator, growth factor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor. Vedolizumab, a humanized mAb against the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin for the potential treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.Data from phase II clinical trials of vedolizumab demonstrated efficacy with an attractive safety profile, especially in ulcerative colitis. Large phase III, multicenter trials in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will provide valuable data for the ongoing development of vedolizumab, which might evolve as a new anti-inflammatory treatment option for the management of therapy-refractory patients.The development of a new specific molecule, vedolizumab, is currently under investigation in a large clinical trial.

Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) attracted our attention. SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression.CONCLUSION: Our results collectively showed a progression-driving role of SPAG5 in PCa which can be regulated by miR-539, suggesting that miR-539/SPAG5 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa.RESULTS: We identified that SPAG5 expression was gradually increased in PCa progression and its level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence. Our results indicated that SPAG5 knockdown can drastically inhibit PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and supress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. miR-539 inhibits prostate cancer progression by directly targeting SPAG5.SPAG5 as a prognostic biomarker and chemotherapy sensitivity predictor in breast cancer: a retrospective, integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and protein analysis.Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR]1\u00b750, 95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b792, p=0\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b740-2\u00b701, p<0\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b732-2\u00b712, p<0\u00b70001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020).

Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.SPAG5 upregulation predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients and alters sensitivity to taxol treatment via the mTOR signaling pathway.Previously, we found that sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) was upregulated in pelvic lymph node metastasis-positive cervical cancer.In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in cervical cancer.RESULTS: We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC, including SPAG5, POLH, KIF23, and RAD54L, which are associated with mitotic spindle formation, DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and dsDNA break repair, respectively.Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation.In our study, SPAG5 expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays. In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b760, p=0\u00b70010).We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), NIn multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020).THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human aorta cDNA library, we identified mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)2, a member of the ERK cascade, as an hDlg binding partner.Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses.Here, we show that two scaffold proteins, caveolin-1 and IQGAP1, are required for phosphorylation of the actin associated pool of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in response to protein kinase C activation.ERK activation is enhanced by the scaffolding proteins KSR and MP1, localized near the cell membrane and late endosomes respectively, but little is known about their dynamic interplay. Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells. These scaffolds include KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), beta-arrestin, MEK partner-1, Sef and IQGAP1.Here we analyze a potential scaffold of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), by generating KSR-deficient mice. This demonstrates that KSR is a bona fide scaffold that is not required for but enhances signaling via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.We reported previously that several 14-3-3 isotypes bind to protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta and facilitate coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 [van der Hoeven, van der Wal, Ruurs, van Dijk and van Blitterswijk (2000) Biochem. J. 345, 297-306], an event that boosts the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) pathway in Rat-1 fibroblasts. In this study, IQGAP1 (IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1), a new Nrf2 interaction partner that we have published previously, was found to modulate MEK-ERK-mediated Nrf2 activation and induction of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes.In the aggregate, these results suggest that IQGAP1 may play an important role in the MEK-ERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses.The MAP kinase ERK and its scaffold protein MP1 interact with the chromatin regulator Corto during Drosophila wing tissue development.KSR-1 is a scaffold protein that is essential for Ras-induced activation of the highly conserved RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Previously, we identified a close homolog of KSR-1, called KSR-2, through structural homology-based data miningThe scaffold protein beta-arrestin2 interacted with both p-ERK and D1 DA receptor, triggering the cytosolic retention of p-ERK and inducing striatal neuronal apoptotic death. Involvement of the MP1 scaffold protein in ERK signaling regulation during Drosophila wing development.Beta-arrestin mediates desensitization and internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs), but also acts as a scaffold protein in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade.Recent studies indicate that kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)is a scaffold protein for the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in mammals. The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates cell signaling through the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade and positively regulates ERK signaling.Our results indicate that KSR-2 may act as a scaffold protein similar as KSR-1 to mediate the MAPK core (RAF-MEK-ERK) signaling but with a distinct RAF isoform specificity, namely KSR-2 may only mediate the A-RAF signaling while KSR-1 is responsible for transducing signals only from c-RAF.Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the core kinase components of the ERK cascade, Raf, MEK, ERK to provide spatial and temporal regulation of Ras-dependent ERK cascade signaling.These findings identify KSR2 as a Ca2+-regulated ERK scaffold and reveal a new mechanism whereby Ca2+ impacts Ras to ERK pathway signaling.MEK Partner-1 (MP1) was identified as a potential \"scaffold\" protein for the mammalian extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathwayThe scaffold protein MP1 (MEK1 partner) assembles a scaffold complex in the ERK cascadeIQGAP1 scaffold-MAP kinase (ERK) interaction was noted in the human myeloma RPMI8226 cell lines.

Many of the common respiratory illnesses of infancy and childhood are caused by viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, in particular measles virus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI3).Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017.The large virus family Paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses, such as measles-, distemper-, mumps-, parainfluenza-, Newcastle disease-, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses.", "answers": {"answer_start": [187, 232, 465, 2002], "text": ["measles", "mumps", "encephalitis", "respiratory disease"]}}

Pre-clinical studies suggest that vaccination with combination of primary DC subsets, such as myeloid and plasmacytoid blood DCs (mDCs and pDCs, respectively), may result in stronger clinical responses. However, it is a challenge to obtain high enough numbers of primary DCs for immunotherapy, since their frequency in blood is very low. We therefore explored the possibility to generate them from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we show that by inhibiting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor with its antagonist StemRegenin 1 (SR1), clinical-scale numbers of functional BDCA2(+)BDCA4(+) pDCs, BDCA1(+) mDCs, and BDCA3(+)DNGR1(+) mDCs can be efficiently generated from human CD34(+) HPCs. The ex vivo-generated DCs were phenotypically and functionally comparable to peripheral blood DCs. They secreted high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers following stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Further, theodent models of prostate cancer have served as valuable preclinical models to evaluate novel treatments and understand malignant disease progression. In particular, a transgenic rat autochthonous model of prostate cancer using the SV40 large T antigen expressed under a prostate-specific probasin promoter was previously developed as a model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (TRAP). In the current report, we backcrossed this strain to the Lewis strain, an inbred rat strain better characterized for immunological analyses. We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age. Tumors were predominantly androgen-dependent, as castration prevented tumor growth in the majority of animals. Finally, we demonstrate that Lew-TRAP rats could be immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding a human prostate tumor antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase) with the development of Lewis strain-specific T-cell responses.

In addition, sequence analyses of the plant C5-MTase target recognition domain sequences were performed and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed showing that there is good conservation among but not within the plant C5-MTase families.To determine the inheritance of DNA methyltransferase genes and their expression patterns we examined three major DNA methyltransferase families (MET1, CMT3 and DRM) from tobacco and the progenitor species.The comparative investigation of transcription levels of different genes of cytosine DNA methyltransferase family MET (MET1, MET2a, MET2b, MET3) and their methylation patterns shows that there may exist some mechanisms defending the most actively transcribed gene MET1 of this family from methylation mediated silencing. In contrast to DRM2 gene we could not find any adenine methylated GATC sites in the MET1 gene.Using the 1kb 3' terminal DNA fragment of the mouse methyltransferase cDNA as a probe and low stringent hybridisation conditions, a new potential methyltransferase (MTase) gene family was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA library.The Dnmt3 family of de novo DNA methyltransferases has recently been characterized in animals. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity.These results provide the first direct demonstration that DNA-METases of a higher eukaryote are encoded by a gene family.Here we show that Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase2 (AtDNMT2) is localized in nucleus and associates with histone deacetylation.To explore possible relationships between DNA methylation level and accumulation of DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase (DNMT) transcripts, the full-length coding sequences corresponding to three different DNMT families in oil palm, namely the MET, CMT, and DRM classes, have been isolated and characterized.In Arabidopsis a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling factor-related protein DDM1 and a cytosine methyltransferase MET1 are required for maintenance of genomic cytosine methylation.Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity.In the present study, the isolation and characterization of two distinct cDNAs that code for carrot DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNA-METase) are reported.The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytosine-5 methyltransferases and shows 50% homology to the murine enzyme in the methyltransferase domain.As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases.", "answers": {"answer_start": [710, 2215, 551], "text": ["MET", "CMT", "DRM"]}}

Male but not female mice carrying a single R403Q missense allele for cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) and F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+), respectively) develop significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) compared with male and female wild-type mice (M-alphaMHC(+/+) and F-alphaMHC(+/+), respectively) after approximately 30 wk of age.A Q1065H mutation was detected in 1 of 21 HCM probands and was absent in 2 unaffected offspring.To understand further the pathogenesis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we determined how the cardiomyopathy induced by an Arg403-->Gln missense mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (403) is affected by chronically enhancing sympathetic drive by mating the mice with those overexpressing G(s)alpha (G(s)alpha x403).

The introduction of the mouse model for FHC (the mouse expresses predominantly alpha-MHC as opposed to the beta-isoform in larger mammals) created a new paradigm for FHC based on finding enhanced motor function for R403Q alpha-MHC.A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) was generated by the introduction of an Arg 403 --> Gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene.Biochemical analysis of one FHC mutant (Arg-249-->Gln) demonstrates that the structures formed by the mutant are solubilized at a lower ionic strength than those formed by wild-type MHC.

Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus. It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 \u03b1-chain receptor. OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis.BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation. Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development.Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor \u03b1-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players.Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.

Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor \u03b1 subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways.Dupilumab inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in asthma.Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways.Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.The robust effects of dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2 cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease.Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor \u03b1 subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathwaysIn early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting IL-4 receptor \ufffd, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of IL-4/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized.OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate dupilumab modulation of the AD molecular signature.METHODS: We performed transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment and posttreatment skin biopsy specimens from patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated weekly with 150 or 300 mg of dupilumab or placebo.RESULTS: Exacerbation of the AD transcriptome was observed in placebo-treated patients.

We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes.This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators.", "answers": {"answer_start": [783, 789, 798], "text": ["Aip1", "Ede1", "Inn1"]}}

Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth. Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds demonstrated native-appearing cartilaginous growth that respected the boundaries of the scaffold.CONCLUSION: Integrated, image-based CAD and 3D printing processes generated patient-specific nasal and auricular scaffolds that supported cartilage regeneration.A prototype meniscus cartilage was prepared to illustrate the potential application in bioengineering.As a proof of concept, we generated a bionic ear via 3D printing of a cell-seeded hydrogel matrix in the anatomic geometry of a human ear, along with an intertwined conducting polymer consisting of infused silver nanoparticles. This allowed for in vitro culturing of cartilage tissue around an inductive coil antenna in the ear, which subsequently enables readout of inductively-coupled signals from cochlea-shaped electrodes. The printed ear exhibits enhanced auditory sensing for radio frequency reception, and complementary left and right ears can listen to stereo audio music.

Loss of function of p15INK4b and p16INK4a (multiple tumor suppressor-I and CDK4 inhibitor) determines impairment in the control of the cell cycle and contributes to the transformation of several cell types. D-type cyclins, in association with the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.In the present study, we analyzed human ovarian carcinoma cell lines for abnormalities in the tumor suppressor gene Rb (retinoblastoma) and in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor genes (p16INK4 and p15INK4B) using molecular biology techniques.These data suggest that abnormalities of Rb and CDK4 inhibitor genes (p16INK4, p15INK4B) may be involved in human ovarian carcinogenesis.The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1. The p15 and p16 CDK4 inhibitor genes map within the chromosome band 9p21 region deleted frequently in malignant mesothelioma and other cancers.The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) inhibitor (p16INK4/MTS1/CDKN2) gene has been recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of the high frequency of homozygous deletion observed in numerous human tumor cell lines, including leukemias. The identification of a cdk4 inhibitor, p16INK4, as a target for mutations in cultured tumor lines and primary tumors suggested that RB activity may be affected in these cells.Roles of cyclin A-Cdk2 as a p27 target and cyclin D2-Cdk4 as a p27 reservoir may result from the differential ability of bound p27 to inhibit the kinase subunit in these complexes.Role of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor gene family p15, p16, p18 and p19 in leukemia and lymphoma.Identification of functional elements of p18INK4C essential for binding and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6.One of the INK4 molecules, p16, is also known as multiple tumor suppressor and has been found to be mutated or deleted in various tumors and cell lines.

We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart diseaseThe prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. As the population ages, the burden of AF increases.t is estimated that this arrhythmia's suffers a significant increase throughout the entire life span, and that its highest raise occurs between the ages of 65 and 80.

This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells.Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate).Junctate is a newly identified integral ER/SR membrane calcium binding protein, which is an alternative splicing form of the same gene generating aspartyl beta-hydroxylase and junctin.Screening a mouse heart cDNA library using canine junctin cDNA as a probe yielded three complete mouse heart cDNAs. One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate.Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate.Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate).Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles.

It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307]. Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases. These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy.Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important.

Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutationsMutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1 and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotypeIgf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbationPCDH10 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene in medulloblastomaThe aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastomaWe report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repressionOur findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progressionWe found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were associated with significantly decreased patient survivalOur analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's expression and survival in children with medulloblastomaBmi1 is required for Hedgehog pathway-driven medulloblastoma expansionThese data provide the first demonstration that Bmi1 is required for spontaneous de novo development of a solid tumor arising in the brain, suggest a crucial role for Bmi1-dependent, nestin-expressing progenitor cells in medulloblastoma expansion, and implicate Bmi1 as a key factor required for Hh pathway-driven tumorigenesisGenomic amplification of orthodenticle homologue 2 in medulloblastomasGenomic alterations normally associated with medulloblastomas, including MYC amplification and isochromosome 17q, were easily detected. Surprisingly, analysis of only five genomes revealed novel amplicons on chromosome 14q, one of which contained the orthodenticle homologue 2 (OTX2) homeobox gene. DNA copy number analysis showed that OTX2 had undergone genomic amplification in 2 of 11 medulloblastoma cell lines and 8 of 42 primary tumorsSerial analysis of gene expression of 240 different human tumors or normal tissues revealed that 96% of all 783 OTX2 transcripts sequenced were in medulloblastomas or embryonic stem cellsOTX2 functions to specify the fate of neuroectoderm in various regions of the developing brain. This developmental role is consistent with the evidence suggesting that OTX2 is a medulloblastoma oncogeneExtensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella)In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellumThese data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastomaWe conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesisBiallelic epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma developmentSeventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG islandHypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidineEpigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastomaRASSF1A hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological variants and age and sex groupingsMedulloblastoma, a brain tumor, develops in about 3% of NBCCS patients, and mutations in PTCH have also been described in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomasRecently, a transgenic mouse hemizygous for the Ptch gene was generated by homologous recombination. Medulloblastomas were found in about 19% of these mice within the first 25 weeks after birthWe also examined the mRNA expression levels for the remaining Ptch allele, as well as for Gli1, a gene known to be transcriptionally activated by Ptch inactivation. Blot analysis of RNA from the 13 tumors shows that Ptch mRNA of appropriate size is expressed in all tumors at varying levels.

The TF BACH2 is essential for T and B lymphocytes and is associated with an archetypal super-enhancer (SE). Single-nucleotide variants in the BACH2 locus are associated with several autoimmune diseases, but BACH2 mutations that cause Mendelian monogenic primary immunodeficiency have not previously been identified. Here we describe a syndrome of BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA) that results from BACH2 haploinsufficiency. Affected subjects had lymphocyte-maturation defects that caused immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. The mutations disrupted protein stability by interfering with homodimerization or by causing aggregation. We observed analogous lymphocyte defects in Bach2-heterozygous mice. More generally, we observed that genes that cause monogenic haploinsufficient diseases were substantially enriched for TFs and SE architecture. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SE architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in SE-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized.", "answers": {"answer_start": [654, 684], "text": ["immunoglobulin deficiency", "intestinal inflammation"]}}

We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein). RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability.Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5' phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase).The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT.Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript.Myc induces methyl cap formation by promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation which recruits the capping enzymes to RNA, and by up-regulating the enzyme SAHH (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase), which neutralizes the inhibitory by-product of methylation reactions.In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95).The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate.The methylation of the 5' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R.

The response rate (RR) to first salvage chemotherapy was 23% (RR by regimen: dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [DHAP] 15%, etoposide, Solu-Medrol, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [ESHAP] 36%, and gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin [GDP] 45%); 25% (n = 28) of patients underwent ASCT. PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens based on platinum and cytarabine in association with etoposide and methylprednisolone (ESHAP) or with dexamethasone (DHAP) with or without Rituximab (\u00b1 R) in patients with refractory or a relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).Because of the inability to safely administer unattenuated doses of anthracycline-based regimens, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) was used at full doses (along with rituximab for the DLBCL patient) until hepatic function normalized (1-5 cycles).

These chondromas were possibly components of Carney's triad, because each nodule had a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and did not have an entrapped epithelium and fat.A curious association of three rare tumours was described by Carney in 1977. 'Carney's triad' characteristically includes multifocal pulmonary chondroma, gastric stromal sarcoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma. We report a female teenager who presented with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach and a paraganglioneuroma. She later developed a pulmonary chondroma, fulfilling the requirements of Carney's triad.A 34-year-old man, who had undergone the gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and para-aortic paraganglioma 3 years before, was found to have a left lung tumor on a computed tomography. The tumor was revealed to be a pulmonary hamartoma, and diagnosed as Carney's triad.INTRODUCTION: Carney's triad is a rare pathogenic entity which consists of the association in young women of multiple condromatosis in the lung, gastric leiomyosarcoma, and extradrenal paraganglioma; although the presence of three at the same time is not required for its diagnosis.Interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) hyperplasia has been documented in conditions associated with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (familial GIST syndromes, Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease) and rarely in the vicinity of sporadic GISTs.Multiple gastric tumors and pararenal non functioning paraganglioma were found. No chondromas were detected. An incomplete Carney's Triad was diagnosed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) occur mostly as sporadic solitary lesions involving the tubular GI tract and are only rarely associated with other benign or malignant neoplasms or occur as part of a multi-neoplastic disease as in the setting of Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease.Carney's triad is a very unusual syndrome, associating three different tumours on the same patient, a young woman generally: a gastric leiomyoblastoma, a pulmonary chondroma and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma. This report encourages clinicians to consider a diagnosis of Carney's triad in patients with multifocal gastric stromal sarcoma, extraadrenal paraganglioma (predominantly mediastinal), or pulmonary chondroma.Carney's triad represents the association of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma.Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome.Carney's triad is a syndrome of unknown etiology, representing a combination of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, bronchial chondromas and vagal, adrenal or paraadrenal paragangliomas.Two of the Carney's triad components-the paragangliomas and the gastrointestinal stromal tumors-are potentially lethal.Carney's triad, a rare disorder affecting young females, is characterized by the presence of at least two of the three following neoplasms: gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma.Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women.We communicate a case with the Carney triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondromatosis and extra-adrenal paraganglioma).The etiology of the Carney's triad (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas, and paragangliomas) is unknown, and only 57 cases have been reported since its identification in 1977.Carney's triad is defined by the coexistence of at least two of three rare disorders, including gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant leiomyoblastoma), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma, most often extra-adrenal and functioning.", "answers": {"answer_start": [143, 167, 192], "text": ["gastric leiomyosarcoma", "pulmonary chondroma", "extraadrenal paraganglioma"]}}

Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST.In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites.Reticulon RTN2B regulates trafficking and function of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1.Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when inducedHere we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determinedReduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (<10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transportersPosition of the third Na+ site in the aspartate transporter GltPh and the human glutamate transporter, EAAT1.We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP.Glutamate receptors and transporters, including T1R1 and T1R3 (taste receptor 1, subtypes 1 and 3), mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors), EAAC-1 (excitatory amino acid carrier-1), GLAST-1 (glutamate-aspartate transporter-1), and GLT-1 (glutamate transporter-1), are expressed in the gastrointestinal tractThe ASCTs (alanine, serine, and cysteine transporters) belong to the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1), which also includes the human glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPhAs astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST)GLT-1, Glutamate Transporter 1, same as excitatory amino acid transporter 2; Glu, glutamateMultiple Functions of Glutamate Uptake via Meningococcal GltT-GltM l-Glutamate ABC Transporter in Neisseria meningitidis Internalization into Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial CellsDespite the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between family members, ASCTs function quite differently from the EAATs and GltPh. First, Li(+) cannot support transport by EAAT2, whereas it can support transport by the other excitatory amino acid transporters, and second, EAAT2 is sensitive to a wider range of blockers than other subtypes. hGLT-1 and hGLuT-1 mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the brain, while hEAAC1 mRNA expression (3.8 kb and 2,4 kb) was strongest in peripheral organs.

It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for partial seizures in adults as both adjunctive and monotherapy, and as adjunctive therapy in children aged from 2 to 16 yearsFor difficult to treat neuropathic pain from cancer, adjuvant analgesics are often used with opioidsKetamine and lidocaine can be safely infused together with concomitant opioids for the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain caused by cancer.Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years.In neuropathic pain or phantom pain coanalgetics should be used to effectively treat pain in young patients.Pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Pregabalin is a GABA analogueTreatment was typically initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, and 5 of the 6 girls noted improvement in their symptoms, including 2 who had marked improvement, and another 3 with substantial improvement who were able to discontinue therapy without a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Vulvodynia does occur among young girls and, when treated as a neuropathic pain disorder, was found to dramatically improve or remit in the majority of those treated in this small case series.We describe a case series of five adolescents who were managed with lidocaine 5% patches for chronic localized neuropathic pain from a variety of causes with minimal adverse effects. Treatment was effective in four of five patients with only one patient complaining of minimal pain reliefTwenty-two children or 14% of children on opioid therapy underwent 30 opioid rotations. Mucositis was the cause of pain in 19 (70%) children, bone pain in 3 (11%) children, and postoperative, visceral, or neuropathic pain in the remainder. The opioid was rotated either for excessive side effects with adequate analgesia (70%), excessive side effects with inadequate analgesia (16.7%), or tolerance (6.7%). Five (23%) children required two rotations, 3 during the same admission. The favored rotations were morphine to fentanyl in 20 (67%) children and fentanyl to hydromorphone in 6 (20%). Adverse opioid effects were resolved in 90% of cases, all failures occurred when morphine was rotated to fentanyl.To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic painDying children with cancer and neuropathic pain have higher baseline requirements of morphine and benzodiazepines and require rapid increases of both drugs in the last 72 hours of life than dying children without neuropathic pain.ketamine treatment may be effective in children with severe neuropathic pain not responsive to other analgesics. This patient also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term ketamine treatment in pediatric oncology and that such treatment can be administered in a home care setting.Oral amitriptyline has been used as an analgesic in a wide range of pain settings. Despite long-term availability of a parenteral form, the few reports about this formulation have been limited to pharmacokinetic studies in normal volunteers, trials in depressed patients, and analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) activation. We retrospectively reviewed our experience using intravenous (IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at Stanford.

The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus which is transmitted to man by means of different species of mosquitoes and causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of illness in different regions of the Old World, including the Mediterranean Basin.Bearing in mind the high percentage of neurological complications found to exist in the most recent outbreaks of WNV infections recorded in the Mediterranean Basin (Bucharest, Algeria), it can be thought that the WNV plays some role in the factors contributing to viral meningitis and encephalitis which occur within the population of the areas at risk within Spain.This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).We compared data obtained from patients with mumps meningitis and patients with aseptic meningitis caused by other viruses in order to identify mumps meningitis-specific cytokine/chemokine alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).METHODS:   We elucidated the cytokine/chemokine network based on the cytokine/chemokine profiles in CSF from children with mumps meningitis and meningitis due to other viral infections using multiplex cytokine measurement.SPORADIC OCCURRENCE OF ECHO VIRUS TYPES 27 AND 31 ASSOCIATED WITH ASEPTIC MENINGITIS IN ONTARIO.Seventeen cytokines/chemokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1\u00e2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-\u00e3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u00e1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u00e2 (MIP-1\u00e2), were measured simultaneously in CSF supernatants from eight children with mumps meningitis, 11 children with other types of viral meningitis and eight children with fever without neurological complications such as convulsion.RESULTS:   We found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\u00e3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complications.CONCLUSION:   Mumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.We found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complicationsMumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.<CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2011 The Authors.Pediatrics International \u00a9 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.</[Adult cases of viral meningitis caused by echovirus type 13].[Epidemic outbreak of viral meningitis caused by type 30 ECHO virus].[Outbreak of viral meningitis caused by echovirus type 4 in Misiones province].Compared with other types of viral meningitis, HSV-2-meningitis is associated with a significant rate of neurological complications in the acute stage.Seventeen cytokines/chemokines, namely interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2), were measured simultaneously in CSF supernatants from eight children with mumps meningitis, 11 children with other types of viral meningitis aWe found that IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3 showed a statistically significant increase in CSF from mumps meningitis when compared to other types of viral meningitis and fever without neurological complications.Mumps meningitis may induce a distinct immunological response when compared with other types of viral meningitis.<CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2011 The Authors.Pediatrics International \u00a9 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.</CBACKGROUND:   The mumps virus is frequently the causative agent in aseptic meningitis and mumps has still prevailed in Japan.

Most patients with such vision loss have Wernicke encephalopathy with characteristic changes seen on neuroimaging. Other patients may have retinal hemorrhages, optic disc edema, and peripheral neuropathy without Wernicke encephalopathy.Patients who undergo bariatric surgery and have a thiamine deficiency can present with visual symptoms and ophthalmologic findings only visible by fundoscopy prior to developing more severe and potentially irreversible complications from the vitamin deficiency.Children deficient in vitamin E have various neurologic symptoms.A 15-year-old boy with fat malabsorption due to cystic fibrosis who was diagnosed as being vitamin E deficient (< 0.5 mg/l), had typical neuropathies. On the other hand, a 12-year-old Beduin girl had isolated vitamin E deficiency, as well as neurological symptoms suggestive of Friedrich's ataxia.The demands in vitamin B12 are particularly high in nervous tissue. Hypovitaminosis is accompanied by pathological lesions both in white and gray brain matter. Several types of neurological manifestations are described: subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord (funicular myelinosis), sensomotor polyneuropathy, optic nerve neuropathy, cognitive disorders.A 51-year-old female had been on vegetarian diet as a child, and on restrict vegan diet during the last 2 years, developing severe bilateral deterioration of visual function and polyneuropathy. Blood test revealed low levels of vitamin A, B6 and D.Nutritional visual defects are apparently uncommon nowadays in developed nations. Retinal change-related visual defects caused by hypovitaminoses may be underdiagnosed.Cobalamin deficiency neuropathy is the exception, often presenting with a non-length-dependent sensory neuropathy. Patients with cobalamin and copper deficiency neuropathy characteristically have concomitant myelopathy, whereas vitamin E deficiency is uniquely associated with a spinocerebellar syndrome.Epidemiological and clinical data show that the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are relevant to disease risk and can be observed in the progression of many diseases, especially AD, whereas higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with better cognitive test performance.Multifocal neurological dysfunction in our patient represented beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy related to vitamin B1 deficiency.We report a 25-year-old woman who developed subacute progressive weakness and areflexia followed by confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus following bariatric surgery.Vitamin B12 deficiency is one of the main complications of vegetarianism.We describe the case of a 1 month 20 days-old infant who consulted due to paroxysmal episodes of epileptogenic mechanism; laboratory tests identified a deficiency in vitamin B12 as the cause.Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly personsDeficiencies of vitamin B 1, B 2 or B 6 were also found in patients with intestinal malabsorption and polyneuropathy, diabetic polyneuropathy, optic atrophy, myelopathy and cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology, neurological manifestations of neoplasms arising outside the nervous system, B 12 myeloencephalopathy and Th\u00e9venard's syndrome.Thus, individuals with genetic vitamin E deficiency and the familial hypocholesterolemias may develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and other neurologic signs and symptoms.Symptoms related to vitamin B12 deficiency may be diverse and vary from neurologic to psychiatric.Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurologic manifestation of acute thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.", "answers": {"answer_start": [363, 2268, 2080, 2966, 561, 93, 2636], "text": ["Vitamin B12", "Cobalamin", "Vitamin A", "Vitamin B1", "Thiamine", "Vitamin E", "Vitamin D"]}}

We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and down regulates the expression of GPA.We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1.At other differentiation stages, additional combinatorial interactions occurred between RUNX1 and its coregulators, GATA1 and ETS. Ldb1, a ubiquitously expressed LIM domain binding protein, is essential in a number of tissues during development. It interacts with Gata1, Tal1, E2A and Lmo2 to form a transcription factor complex regulating late erythroid genes. Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis.Here we show that Ski interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis.

FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS.Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as a key protein in the pathogenesis of some cases of ALS. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients. in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. These findings demonstrate a potential link between FUS mutations and cellular pathways involved in stress responses that may be relevant to altered motor neuron homeostasis in ALS.both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43.These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process.Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms abnormal ubiquitinated and phosphorylated inclusions in brain tissues from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS.Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA binding protein, have been associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness and has overlapping clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response.Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress.TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granulesAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder consisting of progressive loss of motor neurons.

This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17.The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.The frequent LOH surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with NF1.In the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene.Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and axillary freckling.In addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis I gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of NF1.Duplicon-mediated microdeletions around the NF1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type I in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower IQ values.Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I.Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans. It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations.In 95% of NF1 individuals, a mutation is found in the NF1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the NF1 gene and several flanking genes.Herein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented NF1. Genetic study (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated no chromosomal losses or gains. Testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the EGFR, p16, PTEN, MDM2 and NF1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of PTEN, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q.Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons.A patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type I is described. The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17.Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. The NFI gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene.Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases.A novel mutation c.4821delA was identified in NF1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p.Leu1607fs).She had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene.RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members.Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene.We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation.The disease gene of the Chinese NF1 family was linked to NF1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, G1336X in the NF1 gene was identified.The present study demonstrated that G1336X mutation in the NF1 gene cause Neurofibromatosis type I in the family.", "answers": {"answer_start": [368, 104], "text": ["NF1 gene", "chromosome 17"]}}

Cases of ethanol toxicity fOne of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery.Conclusion: Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis.Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning.The purpose of this report was to present a case of ethanol-induced hand sanitizer intoxication after spine surgery in a patient with a postoperative delirious state.Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis.If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (\u226560% ethanol or \u226570% isopropanol) (2).We investigated the charge generated on bedclothes (cotton and polyester) during bedding exchange with different humidities and the ignitability of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (72.3 mass% ethanol) due to static spark with different temperatures to identify the hazards of electrostatic shocks and ignitions occurring previously in medical facilities.We subsequently discovered the patient had consumed half of an ethanol hand sanitizer bottle (about 300-400 mL) which was placed at the foot of the bed to prevent infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a logistically reasonable option for most circumstances, mitigating the requirement for clean running water to facilitate more traditional \"soap and water\" methods of hand disinfection.The primary outcome was alcohol-based hand sanitizer use based on weighing bottles of hand sanitizer.Comparison between hand sanitized fingermarks and non-hand sanitized fingermarks showed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizers did not result in any visible differences in fingermark quality.BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0.12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer.METHODS: Fingertip touch culture plates were obtained from 40 HCWs in which all HCWs used antimicrobial soap containing 0.6% chloroxylenol for handwashing according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the entire study, while continuing to use the 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelineWe evaluated the virucidal efficacy of seven hand sanitizers containing various active ingredients, such as ethanol, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, and compared their effectiveness against feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and a GII.4 norovirus fecal extract.Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a common preservative in ophthalmic medications and is the active ingredient in some skin disinfectants and hand sanitizers.The goal here was to determine whether hand sanitizers that contain ethanol or isopropanol as the active microbicide might reduce transmission of these parasites.Ethanol and isopropanol in concentrations present in hand sanitizers sharply reduce excystation of Giardia and Entamoeba and eliminate oral infectivity of Giardia cysts in gerbils.Evaluation of a benzalkonium chloride hand sanitizer in reducing transient Staphylococcus aureus bacterial skin contamination in health care workers.", "answers": {"answer_start": [223, 476, 1195, 739, 3229, 6839, 6824], "text": ["Ethanol", "Alcohol", "isopropanol", "benzalkonium chloride", "methanol", "chlorhexidine", "triclosan"]}}

We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression.Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC.9a interacts with Snail and is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in human breast cancerHere, we have determined that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of E-cadherin in three TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell lines.Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation.Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis.ZEB1, which targets E-cadherin repression, is a transcriptional regulator that has been implicated in EMT, and is associated with uterine and colorectal cancers.The introduction or knockdown of ZEB1 expression in bladder carcinoma cell lines showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasive potential, respectively.However, in vitro assays showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasion after the introduction or reduction of ZEB1, respectively, in transfected bladder cell lines.Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin.

Our data further suggest that the VKORC1 G6853C polymorphism alone may not be useful for predicting warfarin dose requirements in this racial group.A strong association was found between genetic polymorphisms in six genes, including VKORC1, CYP2C9, PROC, EPHX1, GGCX, and ORM1, and interindividual variability in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the strongest predictors were VKORC1 and CYP2C9.Three of six VKORC1 SNPs were found to be very strongly associated with the average warfarin dose required to achieve the target international normalised ratio (INR; p<0.0001)These results are of considerable clinical interest and confirm recently published results regarding the role of these two genes in modifying warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage. The consistent findings regarding the role of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 in warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage represent a clinically useful proof of principal for the use of pharmacogenomic information in medicine and may lead to improved understanding of warfarin's actions.Clinical studies showed an increased plasma level of S-warfarin, decreased clearance of S-warfarin, increased frequency of bleeding, and prolongation of hospitalization in patients with variant CYP2C9 alleles.", "answers": {"answer_start": [228, 239, 14, 797, 2295, 2688, 2700, 2795, 2803, 2817, 4352, 4365], "text": ["CYP2C9", "VKORC1", "ORM1", "CYP4F2", "EPHX1", "CYP2C18", "CYP2C19", "CYP3A5", "protein S", "clotting factor V", "PROC", "GGCX"]}}

The potential benefits of supplement use in athletes are thus questionable. Some studies indicate no benefits, while others highlight potential negative side effects of vitamin supplementation. These data indicate that RQ significantly reduces exercise-induced lipid peroxidation without associated changes in inflammation or plasma antioxidant status.Cr supplementation inhibited the increase of inflammation markers TNF-\u03b1 and CRP, but not oxidative stress markers, due to acute exercise.Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent.Vitamins C and E supplementation had no significant effect on any of the studied parameters.Effects of the two treatments relative to placebo on mean performance in the incremental test and time trial were unclear, but runners faster by 1 SD of peak speed demonstrated a possible improvement on peak running speed with BC juice (1.9%; \u00b12.5%). Training status correlates more strongly with antioxidant status than diet doesConsequently, we can conclude that Biostimine supplementation reduces the postexercise level of TBARS by increasing the antioxidant activity of plasma but has no effect on inflammatory markers.Supplementation with Asx could prevent exercise induced free radical production and depletion of non-enzymatic antioxidant defense in young soccer players.In conclusion these results indicated that treatment with melatonin in acute sports exercise reversed oxidative stress, improved defenses and lipid metabolism, which would result in an improvement in fitness.CoQ(10) supplementation before strenuous exercise decreases the oxidative stress and modulates the inflammatory signaling, reducing the subsequent muscle damage.Heretofore, Cr's positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects.These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE.Nevertheless, based upon the growing evidence that many athletic populations are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, it is recommended that athletes monitor their serum vitamin D concentration and consult with their health care professional and/or nutritionist to determine if they would derive health benefits from vitamin D supplementation.This study examined the effects of 1,000 mg quercetin + 1,000 mg vitamin C (QC); 1,000 mg quercetin, 1,000 mg vitamin C, 400 mg isoquercetin, 30 mg epigallocatechin gallate, and 400 mg n-3 fatty acids (QFO)The two strains, L. rhamnosus IMC 501(\u00ae) and L. paracasei IMC 502(\u00ae), exert strong antioxidant activity. Athletes and all those exposed to oxidative stress may benefit from the ability of these probiotics to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species.These results indicate that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFAs significantly increased oxidative stress at rest and after a judo-training session.Rhodiola Rosea, is an adaptogen plant which has been reported to promote fatty acids utilisation, to ameliorate antioxidant function, and to improve body resistance to physical strenuous efforts. Supplementation with antioxidant vitamin E to athletes at 267 mg (400 IUs) or greater has been reported to reduce levels of LP associated with exercise.Results obtained at the end of the study indicate that zinc supplementation prevents production of free radicals by activating the antioxidant system.The significant increase in the UI of erythrocyte membranes indicates the potential for harm, because a high intake of PUFA might increase susceptibility to lipid peroxidation not counterbalanced by a higher increase in TAA.

Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17.These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV). Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics. The gene responsible for NF1 is located on the chromosome region 17q11.2 and for familial moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25. Autosomal dominant moyamoya disease maps to chromosome 17q25.3.Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3.However, the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomal genotype showed that affected members had the same sequence of the Mitochondrial 3 portion of D-loop with Japanese patients. Smith-Magenis syndrome and Moyamoya disease in a patient with del(17)(p11.2p13.1).We have employed a combination of aCGH, FISH, and MLPA to characterize an approximately 6.3 Mb deletion spanning chromosome region 17p11.2-p13.1 in this patient, with the proximal breakpoint within the RAI1 gene. Moyamoya syndrome in a child with trisomy 12p syndrome.This report presents the first case of moyamoya syndrome with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12. She had been prenatally diagnosed with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12 originating from her mother. She manifested developmental delay and some dysmorphic features of the face and limbs compatible with the clinical features of trisomy 12p.The genes encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 4 and TIMP2 span chromosomes 3p24.2-p26 and 17q25, respectively, which are the locations of familial moyamoya disease (FMMD) genes. We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome with moyamoya syndrome.[Molecular screening for moyamoya disease by use of expressed sequence tag on chromosome 3p]. To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3. Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from moyamoya patients. A novel susceptibility locus for moyamoya disease on chromosome 8q23.Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q. In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.3). Considering the function, we selected nine genes as candidates from a total of 65 genes identified in the 9-cM region of D17S785-D17S836 in chromosome 17q25, and performed sequence analysis on the DNA samples obtained from a pedigree of familial moyamoya disease, which showed a complete linkage to the region by a haplotype analysis. Linkage of familial moyamoya disease (spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis) to chromosome 17q25.The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2.CONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17q25.Recent genetic studies suggest some responsible genetic foci in chromosomes 3, 6 and 17.To further specify the genetic component of moyamoya disease, a linkage study of moyamoya disease using markers on chromosome 6, where the HLA gene is located, was performed. Mapping of a familial moyamoya disease gene to chromosome 3p24.2-p26.A linkage was found between the disease and markers located at 3p24.2-26.We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.

According to the primary site of damage, a distinction is made between demyelinating and axonal forms (CMT1 and 2, respectively, when inherited as an autosomal dominant trait). Leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing protein 1 (LRSAM1) is a ubiquitin-protein ligase with a role in sorting internalised cell-surface receptor proteins.

The program is freely available at http://bio.scu.edu.cn/SCGPred/.Incorporation of splice site probability models for non-canonical introns improves gene structure prediction in plants.We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy.Source code for the updated versions of GeneSeqer and SplicePredictor (distributed with the GeneSeqer code) isavailable at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/bioinformatics2go/gs/download.html.

Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro.In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo.Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation.We report an unexpected direct association between fascin, an actin-bundling component of filopodia, microspikes and lamellipodial ribs, and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), a regulator of focal adhesions.Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types.Actin-crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells.IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo.Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo.Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8.Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions.The bundling activity of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is required for filopodium formationFilopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP).It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction.Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia.Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments.Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia.Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation.The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro.These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family.Role of the actin bundling protein fascin in growth cone morphogenesis: localization in filopodia and lamellipodiaFascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia.Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons.Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles.Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones.Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles.", "answers": {"answer_start": [811, 4496, 3164, 3854, 4002], "text": ["Fascin", "Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53)", "Eps8", "Diaphanous-related formin (dDia2)", "Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)"]}}

Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis. Of the 311 women, 30.9 % (96/311) were diagnosed with MetS.

Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) test values in these women were compatible with insulin resistance (P < 0.05). CRP and  is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Severalalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries. This disorder is not only associated with a higher risk of appearance of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, but impacts on the liver in different ways. Nonalcbolic syndrome (MS) components, such as dyslipidemia, prothrombotic status, and increased blood pressure, are risk factors for patients with renal disease. Visceral fat mass is closely related to the MS and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of body compositions and MS on anemia parameters and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Body composition (body mass index and bioimpedance analysis) and laboratory data were obtained from 110 dialysis patients. The MS was identified according to ATP-III criteria. Anemia parameters, hemoglobin (Hgb), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone levels, and rHuEPO requirements over the last 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with the MS seem to reach target Hgb levels more frequently (10-12 g/dL; 66.3% vs 84.8%; P = .03) without any difference in total intravenous iron therapy dosage. MS patients also required lower rHuEPO for reaching similar Hgb levels compared with patients without MS (2679.3 \u00b1 1936.1 vs 3702.5 \u00b1 2213.0 U/kg/6 mo; P = .02). There webolic syndrome (MetS) is typically diagnosed based on abnormalities in specific clustered clinical measures that are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current MetS criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to delineate differential contributions to MetS by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate MetS severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a CFA of a single MetS factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score. RESULTS: Loadings to the single MetS factor differed by sub-group for each MetS component (p<0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. MetS severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of MetS but high MetS severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional MetS components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of MetS for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for MetS-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time.

The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low.A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA) was evaluated.Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder.

Photosensitive cases are also identified as PIBIDS (photosensitivity with IBIDS). Cases without manifest ichthyosis are also identified as PBIDS. These syndromes defy rigorous definition because of clinical variation between patients. The original two cases were described by Tay in oriental siblings, whose parents were first cousins; thus the disease is also known as Tay syndrome. Tay syndrome or IBIDS is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis and abnormal brittle hair (trichothiodystrophy). Other features include photosensitivity, abnormal nails and multiple developmental defects affecting organs mainly derived from neuroectoderm. We report a case of trichothiodystrophy initially classified as Tay syndrome that based on clinical features, complementary exams as well as on the disease evolution was labelled as PIBIDS syndrome.Tay-syndrome is a rare monogen-inherited ektodermal dysplastic syndrome with ichtyosis, fragility of the hair and physical and mental retardation. The congenital ichtyosis is ubiquitous. Only the skin on the flexion side of the extremity joints are not involved (orthocerathosis combined with paraceratotic strings).In Tay syndrome, the trichothiodystrophy is accompanied by congenital ichthyosis, short stature, delayed physical and mental development and pyramidal tract signs with increase in muscular tone and brisk tendon reflexes. We present a case of Tay syndrome in which a cranial MRI revealed an almost total lack of myelin within the cerebral hemispheres and a patchy hypomyelination of the cerebellum. In accordance, a strongly prolonged visual evoked response pointed to a dysfunction of the white matter in Tay syndrome.For example, the brittle hair due to sulphur deficiency (trichothiodystrophy) is nowadays regarded as genetically heterogeneous; three different syndromes can be distinguished: BIDS syndrome, Tay syndrome, and PIBIDS syndrome. The Tay syndrome (congenital ichthyosis with trichothiodystrophy).The Tay syndrome is a distinct type of congenital ichthyosis characterized by a peculiar anomaly of hair growth which has been termed trichothiodystrophy. Other features of this syndrome are low birth weight, short stature, mental retardation, delayed neuromuscular development and other CNS anomalies, dysplasia of nails, hypoplasia of subcutaneous fatty tissue, prematurely aged facial appearance, hypogonadism, cataracts, osteosclerosis, dysphonia, and increased susceptibility to infections.

Glutamate metabolism is impaired in transgenic mice with tau hyperphosphorylation.In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the protein tau is hyperphosphorylated and eventually aggregates to develop neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a marker of neuronal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, are comprised of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.At 24 months, NFTs progress, tau inclusions propagate to the dentate gyrus, and neuronal loss is evident. At autopsy, brains of AD and a subset of TBI victims display some similarities including accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)--widespread synaptic and neuronal loss and the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) in senile plaques, as well as hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles--have been known for many decades, but the links between AD pathology and dementia and effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive. The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies.Pseudohyperphosphorylation causing AD-like changes in tau has significant effects on its polymerization.In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) are believed to be involved in the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood. Pseudophosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudohyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased levels of microtubule binding as compared to single and double sites. On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation.Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain.In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments.Tau is the major component of the neurofibrillar tangles that are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers' disease.Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are found in a group of diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimers diseaseIn several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filamentsOn the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formationIn the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease, tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into intraneuronal deposits called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, both made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, point to an alteration of microtubules in Alzheimers diseaseHyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments.Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. This hyperphosphorylated tau can be dephosphorylated at some of the abnormal phosphorylated sites by purified protein phosphatase-1, 2A, and 2B in vitro.Adult human nerve cells contain tau protein, a phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein, that is hyperphosphorylated in the fetus and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.Importantly, hyperphosphorylated tau comprises the paired helical filament, whose pathological deposition as neurofibrillary tangles is implicated in Alzheimer's disease; hyperphosphorylated tau is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders.In Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tau is ~three to four-fold more hyperphosphorylated than the normal adult brain tau and in this hyperphosphorylated state it is polymerized into paired helical filaments ([PHF) admixed with straight filaments (SF) forming neurofibrillary tangles.", "answers": {"answer_start": [468, 2450, 109, 129, 156], "text": ["NFTs", "NFT formation", "Axonal instability", "Synaptic degeneration", "Neuronal loss"]}}

Herein, we report a child with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) with a novel mutation in the SMAD4 gene. Subsequent genetic screening revealed a novel mutation in SMAD4, exon 5 (p.Ser144Stop). A SMAD4 mutation indicative of juvenile polyposis syndrome in a family previously diagnosed with Menetrier's disease.CONCLUSION: The 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 is the cause of JPS and the likely cause of MD in a large family initially diagnosed with MD.A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD. ince his initial diagnosis of JPS further studies have confirmed an association between JPS and mutations in BMPR1A in chromosome band 10q23.2, which is in close proximity to PTEN.Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4.Exome sequencing identified a germline heterozygous mutation in SMAD9 (SMAD9(V90M)). Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A. Somatic alterations in juvenile polyps from BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers.Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients.The JPS is caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A. Germline mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A disrupt the transforming growth factor \u03b2 signal transduction pathway, and are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome.This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome.Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. Individuals with JPS due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).BMPR1A and SMAD4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome.In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found.Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A.BACKGROUND In patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) the frequency of large genomic deletions in the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes was unknown.in

syndromes must be critically interpreted.juvenile polyposis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple distinct juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal cancer the cumulative life time risk of colorectal cancer is 39 and the relative risk is 34 juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes clinically juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis in about 50 60 of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the smad4 or bmpr1a gene is found both genes play a role in the bmp tgf beta signalling pathway it has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so called landscaper mechanism where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment follow up and screening of at risk individuals each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome in addition juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer this review discusses clinical manifestations genetics pathogenesis and management of juvenile

gastrointestinal cancers specifically colon cancer bmpr1a and smad4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome we identified a bmpr1a mutation which involves a duplication of coding exon 3 c 230 452 333 441dup1995 on multiple ligation dependent probe amplification in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome the mutation causes a frameshift producing a truncated protein p d112nfsx2 therefore the mutation is believed to be pathogenic we also identified a duplication breakpoint in which alu sequences are located these results suggest that the duplication event resulted from recombination between alu sequences to our knowledge partial duplication in the bmpr1a gene has not been reported previously this is the first case report to document

Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe cardiac toxicity. Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles). The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients.Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles.Sixty chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of 30 to 71 years in age, P.S. = 0-1, receiving 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC 75) q 21 days or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 120 mg/m2 epirubicin or high dose mitomycin-methotrexate-mitoxantrone (MMM) q 14 days (+ G-CSF) or 100 mg/m2 epirubicin (+ G-CSF) were randomized to receive, 15 min before chemotherapy, 8 mg i.v. bolus of ondansetron or 3 mg i.v. granisetron or 5 mg i.v. tropisetron and no further antiemetic therapy in the following days.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization.The aim of this study, using a Fleming single-stage design, was to explore the efficacy and safety of Taxotere 100 x mg x m(-2) docetaxel and FEC 75 cyclophosphamide 500 mg x m(-2), fluorouracil 500 x mg x m(-2) and epirubicin 75 mg x m(-2), in alternating and sequential schedules for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75).We studied the feasibility of FEC (75) (fluorouracil: 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin: 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide:500 mg/m(2), q 3 w, 6 cycles) as adjuvant chemotherapy for 59 primary breast cancer patients.Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75)Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization.The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 14, 30], "text": ["fluorouracil", "epirubicin", "cyclophosphamide"]}}

Interestingly, silencing of uc.63 induces apoptosis in vitro. However, silencing of host gene XPO1 does not cause the same effect suggesting that the transcription of uc.63 is independent of XPO1. Our results reveal an important role of uc.63 in promoting breast cancer cells survival and offer the prospect to identify a signature associated with poor prognosis.uc.38 induces breast cancer cell apoptosis via PBX1.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis.

TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice.The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions.Twist1 is a key regulator of cancer-associated fibroblastsIn xenograft models, tumor infiltration of Twist1-expressing CAFs was enhanced strongly by ectopic IL6 expression in gastric or breast cancer cells.Enforced expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts was also sufficient to drive CAF marker expression and malignant character in gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.TWIST1, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, is critical for oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenesis. The Transcription Factor ETV5 Mediates BRAFV600E-Induced Proliferation and TWIST1 Expression in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Cellsup-regulates Twist1 in non-small cell lung cancer cells leading to increased migration, invasion, and resistance to crizotinibCombination of Twist1 siRNA and crizotinib significantly reduced cell vitality, inhibited cell invasion and migration, and promoted apoptosis in A549-CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation cellshese results suggested that CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation mediated EMT phenotype by increasing the expression of Twist1, resulting in drug resistance. Combination of Twist1 silence and ROS1 inhibitor may provide a potent strategy to treat the ROS1+ NSCLC patients with crizotinib resistance.Disruption of ETV6 leads to TWIST1-dependent progression and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in prostate cancerOur results implicate ETV6 as a potential marker for predicting efficacy of an EGFR-targeted anticancer approach. Combination treatment of TWIST1 inhibitors could sensitize the anti-proliferation effects of EGFR-TKIs.Long noncoding RNA PVT1 promotes EMT via mediating microRNA-186 targeting of Twist1 in prostate cancerFurthermore, PVT1 can promote EMT by up-regulation of Twist1, a transcription factor associated with EMT. We then confirmed that PVT1 acts as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 by a sponge effect.Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly, knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal phenotype and cell migration ability.we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression.TMPRSS4 Upregulates TWIST1 Expression through STAT3 Activation to Induce Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.Taken together, we demonstrated a mechanistic cascade of TMPRSS4 up-regulating STAT3 activation and subsequent TWIST1 expression, leading to prostate cancer migrationPhosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.Twist1 is expressed in breast, liver, prostate, gastric and other types of cancers, and its expression is usually associated with invasive and metastatic cancer phenotypes.Germline mutation screening of the Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes TWIST1 and FGFR3 in families with BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer.Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells.Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene.Structure-function studies of the bHLH phosphorylation domain of TWIST1 in prostate cancer cells.In humans, a germline mutation (c.309C>G) in the TWIST1 oncogene may predispose to breast cancer and its expression has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis.

This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteinsThis chapter uses the FusionDB database (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) as source of information. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments.PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages.While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships.Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations.Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion eventsHere we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison.Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters.

Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice.Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm.Guided by the medical ethics principles of \"four principles plus scope,\" Chinese aesthetic medical practitioners have proposed some extremely valuable ethical principles combined with the construction of aesthetic medicine and the requirements of clinical practice such as the principle of general nonmaleficence, the principle of local minimal invasiveness, the principle of informed consent, and the principle of respect and confidentiality.This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles.BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. Tom Beauchamp and James Childress have always maintained that their four principles approach (otherwise known as principlism) is a globally applicable framework for biomedical ethics. This claim is grounded in their belief that the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice form part of a 'common morality', or collection of very general norms to which everyone who is committed to morality subscribes.I will argue that there are difficulties with the application of the four principles approach to incompetent children. The most important principle - respect for autonomy - is not directly applicable to incompetent children and the most appropriate modification of the principle for them is not clear. The principle of beneficence - that one should act in the child's interests - is complicated by difficulties in assessing what a child's interests are and to which standard of interests those choosing for children should be held.These principles are: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, along with concern for their scope of application.BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care.Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted.Four main principles underlie medical ethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.This approach to treatment is discussed in the context of the four principles of medical ethics, namely respect for autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence.", "answers": {"answer_start": [12, 264, 229, 285], "text": ["autonomy", "non-maleficence", "beneficence", "justice"]}}

Analysis of the predictive role and new proposal for surgical strategies based on the modified Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems for spinal metastasis.We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores. A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis. It is for this reason that scoring systems, such as the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, have been createdThe modified Tokuhashi score had better accuracy in determining actual survival.Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients.

Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery.A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery.Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease.Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis.Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasisTokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC.Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution.The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC.The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patientsPredictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems.Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosisThe data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastasesA retrospective study of 180 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases, wherein prognostic score-predicted survival was compared with actual survival.To evaluate and compare the accuracy of prognostic scoring systems in lung cancer spinal metastases.The modified Tokuhashi, Tomita, modified Bauer, and Oswestry scores are currently used to guide decisions regarding operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases.To evaluate the predictive values of Tokuhashi score, revised Tokuhashi score and Tomita score systems for life expectancy and treatment options in patients with spinal metastasis.A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis.The combination of Tokuhashi score and Tomita score may be applied to better predict postoperative survival prognosis and guide the surgical options for patients with spinal metastasis..reported a composite model taking into account a modified Bauer score, preoperative albumin, and ambulatory status of patients with spinal metastasis.", "answers": {"answer_start": [91, 80, 191, 1199], "text": ["Tokuhashi", "Tomita", "Bauer", "Oswestry"]}}

However, the expression and biological role of miR-301b in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here we aimed to evaluate the roles and mechanisms of miR-301b in TNBC cells. miR-301b expression was assessed in TNBC specimens and cell lines by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). TNBC cells were transfected with miR-301b mimics, inhibitors or Cylindromatosis (CYLD) small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. The functional roles of miR-301b were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Western blots and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of mRNAs and proteins in the cells. We found that miR-301b was upregulated in TNBC specimens and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-301b promoted cell proliferation in TNBC cells, while inhibited the apoptosis induced by 5-FU. CYLD was downregulated by miR-301b at both mRNA and protein levels in TNBC cells. Dual-luciferase report assay confirmed that miR-301b downregulated CYLD by direct interaction with the 3'-untranslated region(3'-UTR) of CYLD mRNA. NF-\u03baB activation was mechanistically associated with miR-301b-mediated downregulation of CYLD. However, inhibition of miR-301b reversed all the effects of miR-301b. In conclusion, miR-301b plays an oncogenic role in TNBC possibly by downregulating CYLD and subsequently activating NF-\u03baB p65, and this may provide a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC.Overexpression of microRNA-182 (miR-182) is found in multiple cancers, but the association of miR-182 expression with the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) remains unknown. In this study, up-regulation of miR-182 was validated in TNBC patients and cell lines. Knockdown of miR-182 was observed to hinder the proliferation of BT-549 cells. More importantly, knockdown of miR-182 significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment in BT-549. JC-1 staining and western blot assays revealed that the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) were removed and the outer mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and permeability was altered upon combination of TNF-\u03b1 with anti-miR-182. We then demonstrated that knockdown of miR-182 up-regulated the expression of cylindromatosis (CYLD) deubiquitinase, which promoted the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and subsequent caspase-8 activation in TNF-\u03b1-treated BT-549 cells. Collectively, the results of the present study improve our understanding of the role of miR-182 in TNBC, knockdown of which facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin chains on RIP1, leading to the caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in TNF-\u03b1-treated TNBC cells.

We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT.Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT).Here we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for in vitro cardiac reprogramming using retroviruses encoding GMT.Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors.Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts. We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, in vitro and in vivo.To assess the efficiency of direct fibroblast reprogramming via viral overexpression of GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT).  In addition, transplantation of GMT infected CFs into injured mouse hearts resulted in decreased cell survival with minimal induction of cardiomyocyte genes.Here, to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes. Through this screening method the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4 that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes.We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT).Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously.More recently, we showed that reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo after coronary artery ligation using three cardiac transcription factors (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) offers an alternative approach to regenerate heart muscle.Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells.Srivastava's group reported the first direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblast cells into mesoderm lineage cells (cardiomyocytes) with the enforced expression of three cardiac transcriptional factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.Srivastava's group reported the first direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblast cells into mesoderm lineage cells (cardiomyocytes) with the enforced expression of three cardiac transcriptional factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT)", "answers": {"answer_start": [311, 318, 329], "text": ["Gata4", "Mef2c", "Tbx5"]}}

MetaTM is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six TM topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. On a large data set comprising 1460 sequences of TM proteins with known topologies and 2362 globular protein sequences it correctly predicts 86.7% of all topologies. CONCLUSION: Combining several TM predictors in a consensus prediction framework improves overall accuracy compared to any of the individual methods. Our proposed SVM-based system also has higher accuracy than a previous consensus predictor. MetaTM is made available both as downloadable source code and as DAS server at http://MetaTM.sbc.su.seWe present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%.

In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding.

Each module consists of one or multiple statesA new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteinsThe algorithms presented here, are easily implemented in any kind of a Hidden Markov Model, whereas the prediction method (HMM-TM) is freely available for academic usersTMHMM, the current state-of-the-art method, has less than 52% accuracy in topology prediction on one set of transmembrane proteins of known topology. Based on the observation that there are functional domains that occur preferentially internal or external to the membrane, we have extended the model of TMHMM to incorporate functional domains, using a probabilistic approach originally developed for computational gene finding. Our extension is better than TMHMM in predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins. As prediction of functional domain improves, our system's prediction accuracy will likely improve as wellHere, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states.

False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli.

For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events. Safety data for reslizumab, another anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, and benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody to the IL-5 receptor \u03b1-chain, are comparatively limited, especially for benralizumab, although reports of administration of these antibodies to humans suggest that they are well tolerated.IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).In patients with severe, refractory asthma associated with eosinophilia, however, clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in asthma exacerbations.

Different categories of abnormal cell lines were detected: (1) aneuploidy, including sex chromosome abnormalities and isochromosomes (22 cases), (2) ring or marker chromosomes (12 cases), (3) single deletion/duplication copy number variations (CNVs) (11 cases), (4) multiple deletion/duplication CNVs (5 cases), (5) exonic CNVs (4 cases), and (6) unbalanced translocations (3 cases). Positive cases with MLPA technique were confirmed using either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or follow up confirmatory MLPA probe sets.The deletions/duplications detected in non telomeric regions include regions for Prader Willi/Angelman regions, Williams syndrome, Smith Magenis syndrome and Velocardiofacial syndrome.The bone marrow specimen from a patient with MDS was comprehensively analyzed by a combination of genomic approaches, including chromosomal karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome scanning using Affymetrix high density SNP microarray platform, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using IonTorrent Cancer Gene Panel.Detection of TET2 abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.Fluorescence in situ hybridization of TP53 for the detection of chromosome 17 abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can effectively demonstrate TET2 deletions and is often used to validate molecular results.

Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N=52), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N=7) and acute myeloid leukemia (N=15) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping. We conclude that MC, FISH and SNP-A are complementary techniques that, when applied and interpreted together, can improve the diagnostic yield for identifying genetic lesions in MDS and contribute to the better description of abnormal karyotypes.Here, we report the detection of a reciprocal translocation t(7;21)(p22;q22) in the marrow of two adults with MDS and AML, using conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH).Detection of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5,7 and 8 in myelodysplastic syndromes with fluorescence in situ hybridization and its clinical significanceTo identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases. FISH detected monosomy 7 in 6 samples at the time MDS was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was diagnosed.As chromosomal instability may contribute to leukemogenesis in patients with congenital bone marrow failure (CBMF) disorders, it was the aim of this study to characterize chromosomally aberrant clones that arise during the clinical course of disease by means of R-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses.In one child with congenital thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded. In a girl with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified. Simultaneously, transition into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurred. The brother, who was also afflicted with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration. In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into MDS or AML and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients.Here we assess this capability by applying array CGH to the analysis of copy number alterations in 44 patients with a phenotype of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Twenty-five patients had the deletion on chromosome 22 characteristic of this syndrome as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subtelomeric aberrations previously detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were confirmed in two patients, and accurate diagnosis was provided in two previously undiagnosed complex cases. Microdeletions at 15q11.2-q13 in a newborn with hypotonia, cryptorchidism, and hypopigmentation were detected with few discrepancies between the array results and FISH analysis. Contiguous microdeletion of GSCL, HIRA and TBX1 genes at 22q11.2 was identified in a previously undiagnosed boy with an unusual presentation of the VCF/DiGeorge spectrum. Detection of 20q(-) chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridizationThe results showed that among 52 cases of MDS, 7 (13.5%) cases were positive by FISH, however, of which, 4 cases were positive and the other 3 cases were negative by CC assay. It is concluded that YAC912C3 and interphase FISH providing a powerful technique in the detection of 20q(-) in MDS is an important complement to CC assay.A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in all the patients. -7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q-.Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies.We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in>80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.We clearly present that the use of SKY combined with conventional G-banding analysis and FISH has assisted in the identification of important chromosomal events that may play a key role in the development of t-MDS.n this study, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as complementary techniques for the analysis of two therapy-related secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) cases with complex karyotypes, previously analyzed by G-banding. Comparison of detection of trisomy 8 with fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional karyotype analysis in myelodysplastic syndromeThe trisomy 8 clones were simultaneously detected in 48 MDS cases with FISH and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).Trisomy 8 was detected in 1 of 15 specimens with normal or abnormal karyotype without trisomy 8 by FISH.In conclusion, our results showed that FISH is a sensitive and accurate technique to detect trisomy 8 in MDS patients. It can provide contribute to diagnosis, assessment of curative effect and predicting progress of disease in MDS. Detection of common chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome with a panel fluorescence in situ hybridizationPanel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in MDS.Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (trisomy 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case)Detection of -5/5q- chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridizationIn 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC).Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in MDS.Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH. Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH.CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in MDS and it is more sensitive than CC.Diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Detection of trisomy 8 with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in myelodysplastic syndromesInterphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome. Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2. In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing.

Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor.The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site.These results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme.Rapid synthesis of new DNMT inhibitors derivatives of procainamide.Six compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic Dnmt3A/3L complex and of human DNMT1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. The inhibitors showed selectivity for C5 DNA methyltransferases.DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site.A number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine.ODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.The inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward DNMT may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues.Despite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the DNMT1 binding site. These findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel DNMT inhibitors.Inhibition of HhaI DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation.The presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro.Thus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action.Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI.Zebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases.The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism.Synthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites.The incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into DNA causes potent inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferases. TMechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferases by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine.Substitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase.Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine.These results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation.Analysis of DNA methylation processes related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by 5-azacytidine in Streptomyces antibioticus ETH 7451.Our results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on DNA and RNA synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase.DNA containing 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits methylation by HhaI methyltransferase.The inhibitory effect of the 4'sulfur atom on enzymatic activity may be traced to perturbation of a step in the methylation reaction after DNA binding but prior to methyl transfer.Treatment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with the C5 DNA methyltransferase (C5Mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has previously been shown to induce G2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest.Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize Foxp3 expression in Tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo.Booster of pluripotency: RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase.DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA), have recently been highlighted for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, their action mechanisms have not been clearly defined.Structurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to             5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen\u00ae), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor             (DNMTi).Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear.Human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW48, SW480) were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, followed by trichostatin A (TSA), as a histone deacetylase inhibitor.With increasing 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, the expression of DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner.Psammaplin A (11c) is a marine metabolite previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of two classes of epigenetic enzymes: histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases.Defining the parameters of zebularine-mediated tumor inhibition may advance the future development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as an effective cancer treatment.The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor [trichostatin A (TSA)] both significantly up-regulated miR-146a transcriptional activation by altering the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB in macrophages isolated from aged mice, which suggests that DNA methylation and histone acetylation are involved in the suppression of age-dependent miR-146a expression.Diverse DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective DNMTIs.Currently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools.The effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined.Cooperative action of HDACi and DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTi) has been reported, making combined treatment an attractive choice for cancer therapy.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1519, 4047, 24, 6792, 0, 6494, 426, 3271, 4078, 4101, 4550, 4614, 5610, 2478, 1523, 1375, 1344, 1375, 2767, 1023, 6279, 7413], "text": ["5-azacytidine", "5-azadeoxycytidine", "5-aza-CdR", "Dacogen\u00ae", "5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine", "Decitabine", "5-azacytosine", "ZCyt", "5-fluorodeoxycytidine", "FdC", "5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine", "DZCyt", "4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine", "hydralazine", "2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside", "zebularine", "2-(1H)-pyrimidinone", "zebularine aglycon", "procaine", "procainamide", "RSC133", "Psammaplin A"]}}

The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization. Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation.Here we review evidence for super-enhancer involvement in cancers, complex diseases, and developmental disorders and discuss interactions between super-enhancers and cofactors/chromatin regulators.The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq).In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification.Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity.Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers (SEs) drive expression of genes that play prominent roles in normal and disease cells, but the functional importance of these clustered enhancer elements is poorly understood, so it is not clear why genes key to cell identity have evolved regulation by such elementsSuper-enhancers thus provide a platform for signaling pathways to regulate genes that control cell identity during development and tumorigenesis.Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo.We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression.New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another.Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression.Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin.We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator.Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbationSuper-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity.Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity.We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation.Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs.NF-\u03baB directs dynamic super enhancer formation in inflammation and atherogenesis.Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.", "answers": {"answer_start": [577, 602, 636, 700], "text": ["their magnitude of size", "transcription factor density", "binding of transcriptional machinery", "associated with genes driving cell differentiation"]}}
