531d6bfc267d7dd053000007	How is active neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum detected?	The neurotoxin detection is based on the mouse lethality assay.  which could be shown by bioassay to produce biologically active type B toxin in culture. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) hold great promise for providing various differentiated cell models for in vitro toxigenicity testing.  A direct comparison of BoNT detection using primary rat spinal cord cells and hiPSC-derived neurons showed equal or increased sensitivity BoNT/A intoxication studies demonstrate that the hiPSC-derived neurons reproducibly and quantitatively detect biologically active BoNT/A with high sensitivity (EC(50) âˆ¼0.3 U).  these data suggest that neurons derived from hiPSCs provide an ideal and highly sensitive platform for BoNT potency determination, neutralizing antibody detection and for mechanistic studies. Detection of botulinum neurotoxin-A activity in food by peptide cleavage assay. his study reports the successful use of an enzymatic assay employing an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide as a fast, simple and inexpensive alternative to the mouse bioassay.  BoNT endopeptidase assays in vivo mouse bioassay has for years been the 'gold standard' assay used for this purpose Cell-based assays are currently the only in vitro alternative that detect fully functional BoNTs in a single assay and have been utilized for years for research purposes. mouse bioassay (MBA) is traditionally used to confirm the presence of toxin in serum or food A novel FDC (functional dual coating) microtitre plate immuno-biochemical assay, This report demonstrates a novel assay that utilises the endopeptidase activity of the toxin to detect Botulinum neurotoxin in a pharmaceutical sample. The cleaving of SNAP-25 is monitored via UV-Visible spectroscopy with a limit of detection of 373 fg/mL and has been further developed into a high throughput method using a microplate reader detecting down to 600 fg/mL of active toxin.

5e3a6a4eb5b409ea53000016	List symptoms of the One-and-a-half syndrome.	She experienced diplopia on right horizontal gaze due to a left internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) with an associated left conjugate horizontal gaze palsy, collectively described as a left one-and-a-half syndrome.  We report a case of 43-year-old male, presented with sudden onset binocular diplopia on lateral gazes. Ocular examination showed features of ipsilateral one-and-a-half syndrome.  One-and-a-half syndrome is a syndrome characterized by horizontal movement disorders of the eyeballs, which was first reported and named by Fisher in 1967.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unilateral gaze palsy associated with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), i.e., one-and-a-half syndrome, is well known.  We describe a rare case in which both wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia syndrome and vertical one-and-a-half syndrome were observed in a 68-year-old man with acute ischemic stroke.  "Eight-and-a-half" syndrome is "one-and-a-half" syndrome (conjugated horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia) plus ipsilateral fascicular cranial nerve seventh palsy. On examination, she had left fascicular type of third nerve palsy, vertical one and half syndrome (VOHS), left internuclear ophthalmoplegia and skew deviation with ipsilesional hypertropia.  "Eight-and-a-half" syndrome is "one-and-a-half" syndrome (conjugated horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia) plus ipsilateral fascicular cranial nerve seventh palsy.  We report a unique neuroophthalmological syndrome consisting of vertical one-and-a-half syndrome-resulting from a combination of supranuclear conjugate upgaze palsy associated with left infranuclear (fascicular) third nerve involvement (Weber syndrome)-with concomitant contralesional pseudo-abducens palsy.  One-and-a-half syndrome is a clinical disorder featuring extraocular movements characterized by horizontal conjugate gaze palsy with internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The one-and-a-half syndrome is characterised by a lateral gaze palsy in one direction and internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the other. RATIONALE One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. RATIONALE  One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. One-and-a-half syndrome is characterized by combination of the clinical features of unilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The one-and-a-half syndrome is characterised by a lateral gaze palsy in one direction and internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the other .  One-and-a-half syndrome is a clinical disorder featuring extraocular movements characterized by horizontal conjugate gaze palsy with internuclear ophthalmoplegia .  One-and-a-half syndrome is characterized by combination of the clinical features of unilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia .  A 52-year-old patient developed an eye movement disorder first resembling a left internuclear ophthalmoplegia and subsequently a " one-and-a-half syndrome " as the presenting symptoms of ocular myasthenia gravis .  The one-and-a-half syndrome is characterised by a lateral gaze palsy in one direction and internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the other. RATIONALE One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

52fb42752059c6d71c00005e	Which are the thyroid hormone analogs utilized in human studies?	Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of the TH analog 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) as a replacement for T(4) in brain development.  This treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression.  In the current study, we investigated the effect of a natural thyroid hormone analogue - 3, 3?, 5-triiodo-thyroacetic acid (TRIAC) on regulating proliferation and differentiation and its possible molecular mechanism in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and C57BL/6 mice. TRIAC was effective and safe in ameliorating the effects of hyperthyroidism and ADHD symptoms in a child with known genetic RTH.	[['TRIAC', 'TETRAC']]
5314a7a4dae131f847000003	which mutations of troponin C gene have been found to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	The Ca(2+) binding properties of the FHC-associated cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation L29Q were examined in isolated cTnC, troponin complexes, reconstituted thin filament preparations, and skinned cardiomyocytes.  Effects of calcium binding and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy A8V mutation on the dynamic equilibrium between closed and open conformations of the regulatory N-domain of isolated cardiac troponin C We also used PRE data to assess the structural effects of a familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy point mutation located within the N-domain of cTnC (A8V).  A mutation in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C, TNNC1-A31S, predisposes to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular fibrillation. Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death. In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A. We describe a novel type of mutation (c.363dupG) in Troponin C, a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We report the first frameshift mutation (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male, and have demonstrated that the mutation segregates with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within the family. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). In this study, we investigated the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutations A8V, E134D, and D145E in cardiac troponin C on the properties of the C-domain sites. Recently four new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E) were reported, and their effects on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development were evaluated Comprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutation analysis of TNNC1 performed on 1025 unrelated HCM patients enrolled over the last 10 years revealed novel missense mutations in TNNC1: A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E. The cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation, L29Q, has been found in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results demonstrate that the L29Q mutation enhances the Ca(2+)-binding characteristics of cTnC and that when incorporated into cardiac myocytes, this mutant alters myocyte contractility. Cardiac troponin C-L29Q, related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hinders the transduction of the protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation signal from cardiac troponin I to C. This mutation leads to a leucine-glutamine exchange at position 29 in the nonfunctional calcium-binding site of cTnC.

550312b4e9bde6963400001c	Which genes are known to be involved in Diamond-Blackfan anemia?	Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited red blood cell aplasia that usually presents during the first year of life. The main features of the disease are normochromic and macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, and nearly absent erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. The patients also present with growth retardation and craniofacial, upper limb, heart and urinary system congenital malformations in ~30-50 % of cases. The disease has been associated with point mutations and large deletions in ten ribosomal protein (RP) genes RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, RPS7, RPS10, RPS26, and RPL26 and GATA1 in about 60-65 % of patients This study was aimed to explore the mutations of ribosomal protein (RP) genes in patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). Twenty-one cases of DBA admitted in our hospital from Dec 2008 to Aug 2012 were screened by PCR for mutations in the nine known genes associated with DBA: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, RPS7, RPL35a, RPS10 and RPS26 The results found that 8 patients (38.1%) with DBA had mutations in the genes coding for ribosomal protein, in which RPS19 mutation was identified in 3 patients, RPS24, RPS7, RPL5, RPL11 and RPL35A mutations were identified respectively in 1 of the patient Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a hypoplastic anemia characterized by impaired production of red blood cells, with approximately half of all cases attributed to ribosomal protein gene mutations. We performed exome sequencing on two siblings who had no known pathogenic mutations for DBA and identified a mutation in the gene encoding the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 As a proof of concept, we designed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay targeted to screen the six genes that are most frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients: RPS17, RPS19, RPS26, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. Using this assay we showed that deletions represent approximately 20% of all mutations DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19, are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than 25% of cases. OBJECTIVE: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia caused by mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Fifty percent of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patients possess mutations in genes coding for ribosomal proteins (RPs). Mutations in the gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with DBA, with resulting impairment of 18S rRNA processing and 40S ribosomal subunit formation We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19, are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan anemia and account for more than 25% of cases The first ribosomal gene involved in DBA, ribosomal protein (RP) gene S19 (RPS19 gene), was identified in 1999 These data identify RPL15 as a new gene involved in DBA and further support the presence of large deletions in RP genes in DBA patients.

5c641179e842deac67000012	What are the effects of STEF depletion?	The mechanisms regulating the actin cap are currently poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that STEF/TIAM2, a Rac1 selective guanine nucleotide exchange factor, localises at the nuclear envelope, co-localising with the key perinuclear proteins Nesprin-2G and Non-muscle myosin IIB (NMMIIB), where it regulates perinuclear Rac1 activity. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. STEF depletion drastically reduced dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. STEF depletion and Rac1-N17 expression reduced cAMP-induced TC10 inactivation.

Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1.

Finally, our results demonstrated for the first time that depletion of km23-1 inhibited cell migration of human colon carcinoma cells (HCCCs) in wound-healing assays. Overall, our findings demonstrate that km23-1 regulates RhoA and motility-associated actin modulating proteins, suggesting that km23-1 may represent a novel target for anti-metastatic therapy. Further, knockdown of km23-1 inhibited TGFÎ²-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and transactivation of the c-Jun promoter. knockdown (KD) of km23-1 decreased RhoA activation in Mv1Lu epithelial cells We have previously reported that the dynein light chain (DLC) km23-1 is required for Smad2-dependent TGFbeta signaling. Blockade of km23-1 using a small interfering RNA approach resulted in a reduction in both total intracellular Smad2 levels and in nuclear levels of phosphorylated Smad2 after TGFbeta treatment. Blockade of km23 using small interfering RNAs significantly decreased key TGFbeta responses, including induction of fibronectin expression and inhibition of cell growth. On the other hand, inhibiting the endogenous DYNLRB1 with gene-specific small interfering RNA or pharmacologically with a specific inhibitor (vanadate) led to a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in folate uptake. Functional studies showed that some mutations disrupt km23 function, resulting in aberrant transforming growth factor-beta signaling and presumably enhanced tumorigenicity.

The clinical features of cytopenia, developmental defects, and tumor predisposition are similar in each group, suggesting that the gene products participate in a common pathway. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia and predisposition to both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors Patients with FA exhibit a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical features. The most significant and consistent phenotypic characteristics are stem cell loss, causing progressive bone marrow failure and sterility, diverse developmental abnormalities and a profound predisposition to neoplasia Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, cancer susceptibility disorder characterized by diverse clinical features, such as short stature, skeletal or skin abnormalities, progressive bone marrow (BM) failure, and increased risk of malignancies Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by congenital abnormalities, defective haemopoiesis, and a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia and certain solid tumours Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. Fanconi anemia (FA) consists of a group of at least five autosomal recessive disorders that share both clinical (e.g., birth defects and hematopoietic failure) and cellular (e.g., sensitivity to cross-linking agents and predisposition to apoptosis) features with each other. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Progressive bone marrow failure starting in the first decade of life is one of the main characteristics of Fanconi anemia FA is an autosomal recessive disease with three main features: chromosome instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin and so on, and susceptible to a number of cancer types, mainly leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck or gynecologic system Bone marrow failure resulting in pancytopenia is the main cause of death of FA patients	[['congenital abnormalities'], ['defective haemopoiesis'], ['increased risk of malignancies'], ['cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents']]

It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the Î±1 and the Î±2-chain of type V collagen, respectively In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein Order of intron removal influences multiple splice outcomes, including a two-exon skip, in a COL5A1 acceptor-site mutation that results in abnormal pro-alpha1(V) N-propeptides and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I (the classical variety) is a dominantly inherited, genetically heterogeneous connective-tissue disorder. Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals. Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I Mutations of the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen impair matrix assembly and produce ehlers-danlos syndrome type I We have identified mutations of the COL5A2 gene, which encodes the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen, in two unrelated patients with the severe type I form of EDS Our findings show that heterozygous mutations of the COL5A2 gene can produce the EDS type I phenotype A splice-junction mutation in the region of COL5A1 that codes for the carboxyl propeptide of pro alpha 1(V) chains results in the gravis form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type I) We report that genomic polymorphisms at the pro alpha 1(V) gene (COL5A1) locus cosegregated with the gravis form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) (type I) in a three generation family Since exon 65 encodes 78 residues of the carboxyl propeptide, the expected result of this mutation is reduced efficiency in incorporating mutant pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen molecules and reduced type V collagen synthesis These studies indicate that heterozygous mutations in COL5A1 can result in EDS type I The gene encoding collagen alpha1(V)(COL5A1) is linked to mixed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II Recently, genetic linkage has been demonstrated between the COL5A1 gene, which encodes the alphal chain of type V collagen, and EDS type II in a large British kindred Using a polymorphic intragenic simple sequence repeat at the COL5A1 locus, we now demonstrate tight linkage to EDS type I/II in a three-generation family The variation in expression in this family suggests that EDS types I and II are allelic, and the linkage data support the hypothesis that mutation in COL5A1 can cause both phenotypes. Null alleles of the COL5A1 gene of type V collagen are a cause of the classical forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (types I and II). Recently mutations have been found in the genes for type V collagen in a small number of people with the most common forms of EDS, types I and II The gene encoding collagen alpha1(V)(COL5A1) is linked to mixed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II.

58a2efec60087bc10a000008	Which are the consequences of the hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers' Disease?	The formation of neurofibrillary tangles from the assembly of hyperphosphorylated tau leads to dendritic and axonal instability, synaptic degeneration, and neuronal loss.  Glutamate metabolism is impaired in transgenic mice with tau hyperphosphorylation. In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the protein tau is hyperphosphorylated and eventually aggregates to develop neurofibrillary tangles.  Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a marker of neuronal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, are comprised of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. At 24 months, NFTs progress, tau inclusions propagate to the dentate gyrus, and neuronal loss is evident.  At autopsy, brains of AD and a subset of TBI victims display some similarities including accumulation of AÎ² peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.  The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)--widespread synaptic and neuronal loss and the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (AÎ²) in senile plaques, as well as hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles--have been known for many decades, but the links between AD pathology and dementia and effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive.  The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Pseudohyperphosphorylation causing AD-like changes in tau has significant effects on its polymerization. In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) are believed to be involved in the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood.  Pseudophosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudohyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased levels of microtubule binding as compared to single and double sites.  On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation. Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. Tau is the major component of the neurofibrillar tangles that are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers' disease. Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are found in a group of diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimers disease In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation In the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease, tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into intraneuronal deposits called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, both made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, point to an alteration of microtubules in Alzheimers disease Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.  In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments. Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. This hyperphosphorylated tau can be dephosphorylated at some of the abnormal phosphorylated sites by purified protein phosphatase-1, 2A, and 2B in vitro. Adult human nerve cells contain tau protein, a phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein, that is hyperphosphorylated in the fetus and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, hyperphosphorylated tau comprises the paired helical filament, whose pathological deposition as neurofibrillary tangles is implicated in Alzheimer's disease; hyperphosphorylated tau is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tau is ~three to four-fold more hyperphosphorylated than the normal adult brain tau and in this hyperphosphorylated state it is polymerized into paired helical filaments ([PHF) admixed with straight filaments (SF) forming neurofibrillary tangles.

5318367cb166e2b806000012	List causative genes for autosomal recessive forms of monogenic Parkinson's disease	Mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are the major cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. Early onset PD (EOPD) is particularly associated with autosomal recessive (AR) mutations, and three genes, PARK2, PARK7 and PINK1, have been found to carry mutations leading to AR disease.  Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene are causative of autosomal recessive, early onset Parkinson's disease.  Mutations in other genes, including ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBX07 (PARK15), cause more rare forms of recessive parkinsonism with very early-onset (<30 years) In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7), oss-of-function mutations in Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism with early-onset. mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset. mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.

Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial. METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged â‰¥18 years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or refractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominal or pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that would preclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded. Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion.

5173eb428ed59a060a000021	What type of cancers and inherited diseases have been associated to mutations in the Notch pathway?	Comparative functional genomic analysis identified a signature of Notch activation in 30% of HCC samples from patients. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers. We detected Notch1 missense mutations in 8.3% of the tumors (only in the posterior fossa location and in case of 9q33-34 gain). Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome. In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome. Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we describe a new candidate gene isolated from array comparative genomic hybridization redundant 6qter deletions, DELTA Like 1 (DLL1), which is a ligand of NOTCH. Four genes causing a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease have been identified: DLL3 (SCDO1: MIM 277300), MESP2 (SCDO2: MIM 608681), LFNG (SCDO3: MIM609813) and HES7 (SCDO4). These genes are all essential components of the Notch signalling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Previously, only a single SCD-causative missense mutation was described in HES7. In this study, we have identified two new missense mutations in the HES7 gene in a single family, Here we have used autozygosity mapping to identify a mutation in a fourth Notch pathway gene, Hairy-and-Enhancer-of-Split-7 (HES7), in an autosomal recessive SCD family. Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals. Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously. Altogether 226 different JAG1 mutations have been described in association with AGS, including our novel 36 mutations. Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of JAG1 mutations result in AGS. These include total gene deletions, protein truncating, splicing and missense mutations which are distributed across the coding region of the gene. Here we present results of JAG1 mutation screening by SSCP and FISH in 105 patients with AGS. For these studies, new primers were designed for 12 exons. Mutations were identified in 63/105 patients (60%) We have screened 54 AGS probands and family members to determine the frequency of mutations in JAG1. Three patients (6%) had deletions of the entire gene. Of the remaining 51 patients, 35 (69%) had mutations within JAG1, identified by SSCP analysis. Of the 35 identified intragenic mutations, all were unique, with the exceptions of a 5-bp deletion in exon 16, seen in two unrelated patients, and a C insertion at base 1618 in exon 9, also seen in two unrelated patients. Analyses of many patients with cytogenetic deletions or rearrangements have mapped the gene to chromosome 20p12, although deletions are found in a relatively small proportion of patients (< 7%). We have mapped the human Jagged1 gene (JAG1), encoding a ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, to the Alagille syndrome critical region within 20p12.

5ace20fa0340b9f05800000c	Which genes are responsible for the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans?	We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.  In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1.  Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Identification of a Tibetan-specific mutation in the hypoxic gene EGLN1 and its contribution to high-altitude adaptation. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion). The estimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (âˆ¼8,400 years ago).  Two functional loci in the promoter of EPAS1 gene involved in high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans. EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude.  HMOX2 Functions as a Modifier Gene for High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetans. In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans.  Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism. Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population.  Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration. Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.

The Tibetan-specific 200 kb EPAS1 haplotype introgressed from an archaic human population related to Denisovans which underwent evolutionary decay; however, the functional variant(s) responsible for high-altitude adaptation at EPAS1/HIF-2Î± have not yet been identified. Further functional analysis revealed that lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene, which was reported to be responsible for extracellular matrix protein cross-linking of amnion previously, was a direct target of EPAS1.

5311d130e3eabad021000009	Which proteins in the cerebro-spinal fluid can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease?

516c3960298dcd4e51000073	Which are the families of mammalian DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferases?	Of the DNMTs, DNMT1 and DNMT3a are most highly expressed in postmitotic neurons. DNA methyltransferase 3B (Dnmt3b) belongs to a family of enzymes responsible for methylation of cytosine residues in mammals. Bovine DNA methylation imprints are established in an oocyte size-specific manner, which are coordinated with the expression of the DNMT3 family proteins. The DNMT3B de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) plays a major role in establishing DNA methylation patterns in early mammalian development, but its catalytic mechanism remains poorly characterized. Dnmt2 proteins are the most conserved members of the DNA methyltransferase enzyme family, but their substrate specificity and biological functions have been a subject of controversy. This promoter hypermethylation may be mediated not only by DNMT-1 but also by an entire family of de novo DNA-methyltransferases, such as DNA-methyltransferase-3a (DNMT-3a) and -3b (DNMT-3b). Within the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt3a and 3b establish methylation marks during early development, while Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns after DNA replication. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. In this study, we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7, which is generated frequently in cancer. DNMT1 is a widely expressed DNA methyltransferase maintaining methylation patterns in development, and mediating transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of related proteins that both catalyze the de novo formation of 5-methylcytosine and maintain these methylation marks in cell-specific patterns in virtually all mitotic cells of the body. This methylation is critical for imprinting; a reduction in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 causes a widespread loss of imprinting. DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the key methyltransferase in DNA methylation regulations. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers. DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferases. These results suggest that DNMT1 and DNMT3B regulate BAG-1 expression via insulator protein DNA-binding and chromatin dynamics by regulating histone dimethylation. Here we show that human miR-148 represses DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) gene expression through a region in its coding sequence. DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including the maintenance enzyme DNMT 1 and de novo methyltransferases DNMT 3a and DNMT 3b. Among the reported down-regulated miRNAs in lung cancer, the miRNA (miR)-29 family (29a, 29b, and 29c) has intriguing complementarities to the 3'-UTRs of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3A and -3B (de novo methyltransferases), two key enzymes involved in DNA methylation, that are frequently up-regulated in lung cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, we have examined the roles of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and related protein (Dnmt3L) in this process. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has been reported to interact with a wide variety of factors and to contain intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity. Inactivation of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, DNA methyltransferases essential for the initiation of de novo DNA methylation, abolished the establishment of DNA methylation and the silencing of Rhox cluster genes in the embryo proper. Rather, in vitro analysis indicates that Dnmt3L stimulates DNA methylation by both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b through direct binding to these proteins. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in promoter of the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene and risk for development and lymphatic metastasis of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA). Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance enzyme DNMT1. There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B.

5314c7afdae131f84700000a	List common features of Shapiro syndrome	Shapiro syndrome is defined as the constellation of periodic hypothermia and hyperhidrosis along with agenesis of the corpus callosum by Shapiro et al. in 1969. Shapiro syndrome is a rare entity, comprising a triad of recurrent hypothermia, hyperhidrosis and congenital agenesis of the corpus callosum.  We present a case of an 80 year old woman presenting with recurrent bouts of shivering, sweating and profound malaise, who sought medical attention because the frequency and severity of attacks worsened in her later years. MRI Brain demonstrated agenesis of the corpus callosum; a rigorous work-up excluded other causes for her symptomatology. These findings imply that aberrant thermoregulation in Shapiro syndrome involves a number of structures remote from the callosal region. A 6-year-old girl previously diagnosed with Shapiro's syndrome was admitted to our hospital on several occasions during a 1-year period with complaints of altered consciousness, syncope, hypothermia and episodes of sweating. Hypermelatoninemia should be considered in patients with spontaneous periodic hypothermia and hyperhidrosis, and also in patients with Shapiro's syndrome. We present a patient diagnosed with Shapiro syndrome without corpus callosum agenesis. A 4-year-old-girl was admitted to the hospital with complaints of sweating, cooling, and drowsiness that continued during the last week of her admission.

The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.  Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been recently classified into five distinct entities, each with different major pathophysiologic mechanisms. CRS type 1 most commonly occurs in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure where approximately 25% of patients develop a rise in serum creatinine and a reduction of urine output after the first several doses of intravenous diuretics.  CRS type 2 is the hastened progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of chronic heart failure.  CRS type 3 is acutely decompensated heart failure after acute kidney injury from inflammatory, toxic, or ischemic insults.  CRS type 4 is manifested by the acceleration of the progression of chronic heart failure in the setting of CKD. Cardiac myocyte dysfunction and fibrosis, so-called 'CKD cardiomyopathy', is believed to be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism. Type 5 CRS is simultaneous acute cardiac and renal injury in the setting of an overwhelming systemic insult such as sepsis.  CRS type I: acute worsening of heart function (AHF-ACS) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction. CRS type II: chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction. CRS type III: acute worsening of kidney function (AKI) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction. CRS type IV: chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction. CRS type V: systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.  Acute CRS (type 1): acute worsening of heart function (AHF-ACS) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Chronic cardio-renal syndrome (type 2): chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Acute reno-cardiac syndrome (type 3): acute worsening of kidney function (AKI) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction. Chronic reno-cardiac syndrome (type 4): chronic kidney disease leading to heart injury, disease, and/or dysfunction. Secondary CRS (type 5): systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.  For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury. For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury The most recent classification recognizes five types of CRS: types I and II originate from heart failure (acute and chronic, respectively), type III and IV from kidney failure (again acute and chronic), while type V originates from a range of systemic diseases The most recent classification recognizes five types of CRS: types I and II originate from heart failure (acute and chronic, respectively), type III and IV from kidney failure (again acute and chronic), while type V originates from a range of systemic diseases. For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury. Based on the pathophysiological primum movens, the actual classification recognizes five CRS types: in type I and II CRS, the initiating event is heart failure (acute or chronic), while it is kidney failure in type III and IV CRS; type V is linked to systemic diseases. An effective classification of CRS in 2008 essentially divides CRS in two main groups, cardiorenal and renocardiac CRS, based on primum movens of disease (cardiac or renal); both cardiorenal and renocardiac CRS are then divided into acute and chronic, according to onset of disease. Of particular interest to the critical care specialist are CRS type 1 (acute cardiorenal syndrome) and type 3 (acute renocardiac syndrome). At present, the classification of the syndrome includes five types of CRS: types I and II which are strictly related to initial heart failure (both acute and chronic), types III and IV which include initial kidney failure, and type V which includes several systemic diseases. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes reflecting the primacy of organ dysfunction and the time-frame of the syndrome: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction, and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.

To that effect, targeted therapies to EGFR such as Cetuximab, Panitumumab-monoclonal antibodies and Gefitinib, Erlotinib-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have had success in therapeutic scenarios. Two important strategies that have attenuated lung cancers were through treatments with EGFR-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, or EGFR-neutralizing antibodies, cetuximab and bevacizumab.  The best known targeted therapies include: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, zalutumumab and nimotuzumab), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, afatinib and dacomitinib) EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) (erlotinib and gefitinib), of second-generation EGFR-TKI (afatinib) plus/minus the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, and of third-generation EGFR-TKI (osimertinib).

5d387360a1e1595105000007	What are the effects of CAMK4 inhibition?	CaMK4-dependent activation of AKT/mTOR and CREM-Î± underlies autoimmunity-associated Th17 imbalance  Here, we present evidence that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) is increased and required during Th17 cell differentiation. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator Î± (CREM-Î±) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. CaMK4 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for Th17-driven autoimmune diseases. CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling CaMK4 inhibition significantly decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, and lactate, whereas it did not affect the levels of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates such as 6-Phospho-D-gluconate, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate	[['Th17 differentiation'], ['reduction of Il17 expression'], ['decreased activation of cAMP']]
5321badd9b2d7acc7e00000a	Which types of cancer can be recognized and treated by the use of immunotherapy?	omising expansion of antigen-specific T cells, the clinical responses following vaccination have been limited, indicating that further improvements of DC vaccine potency are necessary. Pre-clinical studies suggest that vaccination with combination of primary DC subsets, such as myeloid and plasmacytoid blood DCs (mDCs and pDCs, respectively), may result in stronger clinical responses. However, it is a challenge to obtain high enough numbers of primary DCs for immunotherapy, since their frequency in blood is very low. We therefore explored the possibility to generate them from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we show that by inhibiting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor with its antagonist StemRegenin 1 (SR1), clinical-scale numbers of functional BDCA2(+)BDCA4(+) pDCs, BDCA1(+) mDCs, and BDCA3(+)DNGR1(+) mDCs can be efficiently generated from human CD34(+) HPCs. The ex vivo-generated DCs were phenotypically and functionally comparable to peripheral blood DCs. They secreted high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers following stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Further, the odent models of prostate cancer have served as valuable preclinical models to evaluate novel treatments and understand malignant disease progression. In particular, a transgenic rat autochthonous model of prostate cancer using the SV40 large T antigen expressed under a prostate-specific probasin promoter was previously developed as a model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (TRAP). In the current report, we backcrossed this strain to the Lewis strain, an inbred rat strain better characterized for immunological analyses. We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age. Tumors were predominantly androgen-dependent, as castration prevented tumor growth in the majority of animals. Finally, we demonstrate that Lew-TRAP rats could be immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding a human prostate tumor antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase) with the development of Lewis strain-specific T-cell responses. We propose  we analyzed NY-ESO-1 expression in 222 melanoma specimens, including 16 primary and 206 metastatic tumors. Our results support previous findings showing higher expression of NY-ESO-1 in metastatic (58/206; 28.2%) versus primary (0/16) tumors. In addition, our results show that the epithelioid subtype of melanoma has the highest incidence of NY-ESO-1 expression. These findin  Immunotherapy is a highly promising form of cancer treatment, but its efficacy can be severely compromised by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

This protein recruits the NER lesion-recognition factor UvrA, and then dissociates from the DNA. UvrA binds UvrB, and the assembled UvrAB* complex initiates repair. UvrB plays a key role in bacterial nucleotide excision repair. It is the ultimate damage-binding protein that interacts with both UvrA and UvrC. UvrB subunits bind to UvrA, most likely as part of a UvrA2B2 complex Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair (NER) is responsible for removing bulky DNA adducts by dual incisions of the UvrABC endonuclease. the activity of the UvrAB complex which can induce DNA conformational change is employed in NER The recognition by Escherichia coli Uvr nucleotide excision repair proteins of a variety of lesions with diverse chemical structures and the presence of helicase activity in the UvrAB complex which can displace short oligonucleotides annealed to single-stranded DNA led to a model in which this activity moves UvrAB along undamaged DNA to damaged sites where the lesion blocks further translocation and the protein-DNA pre-incision complex is formed.

5333f728d6d3ac6a34000041	List algorithms suitable for predicting protein complexes	Protein complexes are basic cellular entities that carry out the functions of their components we have designed several features characterizing heterodimeric protein complexes based on genomic data sets, and proposed a supervised-learning method for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. This method learns the parameters of the features, which are embedded in the naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier  non-interacting proteins (NIPs) is important for training the algorithms to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and for assessing the false positive rates of PPI detection efforts. We present the second version of Negatome, Negatome is derived by manual curation of literature and by analyzing three-dimensional structures of protein complexes. Identification of protein-ligand binding site is an important task in structure-based drug design and docking algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to cluster the pockets that are most likely to bind ligands with the attributes of geometric characteristics, interaction potential, offset from protein, conservation score and properties surrounding the pockets Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology. The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods We developed a novel PTM refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs in the input data. The use of this new modeling approach enables iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictions We develop an algorithm for identifying protein complexes by considering these two types of complexes separately. We test our algorithm on a few yeast protein interaction networks, and show that our algorithm is able to identify complexes more accurately than existing algorithms. A software program NDComplex Studying protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the structure-functionality relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data  To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in PPI networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in PPI networks Identification of protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is the first step in understanding the organization and dynamics of cell function. We have developed an algorithm PROCOMOSS (Protein Complex Detection using Multi-objective Evolutionary Approach based on Semantic Similarity) for partitioning the whole PPI network into clusters, which serve as predicted protein complexes. With the exponentially growing amount of protein sequence data, an exploration of new methods that predict protein interaction sites based solely on sequence information is becoming increasingly urgent This paper describes a new method that predicts interaction sites based on protein sequences by integrating five different algorithms employing meta-method, Majority Vote and SVMhmm Regression techniques The 'metaPIS' web-server was implemented for meta-prediction.  In this paper, a novel protein complex identifying method, named EPOF, is proposed, using essential proteins and the local metric of vertex fitness We compare the performances of EPOF to other ten previous algorithms, including EAGLE, NFC, MCODE, DPClus, IPCA, CPM, MCL, CMC, SPICi, and Core-Attachment.  We compare the performance of ProRank to some of the well known protein complex prediction methods (ClusterONE, CMC, CFinder, MCL, MCode and Core) in terms of precision and recall In this paper we evaluated four different clustering algorithms using six different interaction datasets. We parameterized the MCL, Spectral, RNSC and Affinity Propagation algorithms and applied them to six PPI datasets produced experimentally by Yeast 2 Hybrid (Y2H) and Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) methods this paper, we present a new topology-based algorithm, HKC, to detect protein complexes in genome-scale PPI networks. HKC mainly uses the concepts of highest k-core and cohesion to predict protein complexes by identifying overlapping clusters.   Protein complexes are important entities to organize various biological processes in the cell, like signal transduction, gene expression, and molecular transmission. In most cases, proteins perform their intrinsic tasks in association with their specific interacting partners, forming protein complexe Macropol et al. proposed a protein complex prediction algorithm, called RRW, which repeatedly expands a current cluster of proteins according to the stationary vector of a random walk with restarts with the cluster whose proteins are equally weighted. In the cluster expansion, all the proteins within the cluster have equal influences on determination of newly added protein to the cluster. In this paper, we extend the RRW algorithm by introducing a random walk with restarts with a cluster of proteins, each of which is weighted by the sum of the strengths of supporting evidence for the direct physical interactions involving the protein. The resulting algorithm is called NWE (Node-Weighted Expansion of clusters of proteins).  In this paper, we propose a new topological model by extending the definition of k-clique community of algorithm CPM and introduced distance restriction, and develop a novel algorithm called CP-DR based on the new topological model for identifying protein complexes This paper also describes a random forest classifier which can effectively combine the structure-based prediction results and other functional annotations together to predict protein interactions Here we explain the development and implementation of a novel Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Engine termed PIPE.

Body weight, patient activity, and the difference between MHR and RHR are mutually correlated and may reasonably contribute to an algorithm for predicting heart failure deterioration. Blood pressure appears to offer no additional value. As both genesis and symptoms of heart failure exacerbation are non-uniform and complex, the telemonitoring concepts for heart failure patients should employ continuous monitoring of multiple diagnostic parameters, rather than rely on a single parameter.

The strongest associations were for mood swings (OR 20.9, 95%CI 16.2-27.0), memory loss/lack of concentration (OR 19.6, 95% CI 15.5-24.8), night sweats (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.5-15.2), general fatigue (OR 9.6, 95% CI 8.3-11.1) and sexual dysfunction (OR 4.6, 95%CI 3.2-6.6). The symptoms include incapacitating fatigue, musculoskeletel and joint pains, headaches, neuropsychiatric disorders, affect changes, confusion, visual problems, changes of gait, loss of memory, lymphadenopathies, respiratory impairment, impotence, and urinary tract morphological and functional alterations.  In early 1992, U.S. troops returning from the Gulf War began reporting a variety of nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, skin rash, headache, muscle and joint pain, and loss of memory. These reports marked the beginning of what was to be identified as the Gulf War Syndrome (GWS).  We report on a 29-year-old man who suffered from dysmnesia, disturbance of orientation, cognitive impairment, and double vision. His history revealed several front-line operations in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War.  Neuropsychological tests disclosed severe cognitive impairment especially concerning memory. A cluster of common health problems included: skin rash, cough, depression, unintentional weight loss, insomnia, and memory problems. Syndromes 1 ("impaired cognition," characterized by problems with attention, memory, and reasoning, as well as insomnia, depression, daytime sleepiness, and headaches), 2 ("confusion-ataxia," characterized by problems with thinking, disorientation, balance disturbances, vertigo, and impotence), and 3 ("arthro-myo-neuropathy," characterized by joint and muscle pains, muscle fatigue, difficulty lifting, and extremity paresthesias) represented strongly clustered symptoms; whereas, syndromes 4 ("phobia-apraxia"), 5 ("fever-adenopathy"), and 6 ("weakness-incontinence") involved weaker clustering and mostly overlapped syndromes 2 and 3.

530cf4d5e2bfff940c000004	Which are the most common methods for gene prioritization analysis?	We developed a new network inference algorithm called the Knowledge Network Gene Prioritization (KNGP) algorithm which can incorporate both link and node knowledge  In recent years, network-based methods - which utilize a knowledge network derived from biological knowledge - have been utilized for gene prioritization We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour, to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these phenomena  We intend to use the ensemble boosting learning techniques to combine variant computational approaches for gene prioritization in order to improve the overall performance. The experimental results show that our ensemble learning approach outperforms the four gene-prioritization methods in ToppGene suite in the ranking results of the 13 known genes in terms of mean average precision, ROC and AUC measures The proposed enhanced RaJoLink rare-term model combines text mining and gene prioritization approaches.  Computational gene prioritization is based on various pieces of correlative evidence that associate each gene with the given disease and suggest possible causal links Recently, many network-based methods have been proposed that implicitly utilize the modularity principle, which states that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to form physical or functional modules in gene/protein relationship networks the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach, but the modularity principle has not been fully considered in traditional RWR approaches Therefore, we propose a novel method called ORIENT (neighbor-favoring weight reinforcement) to improve the performance of RWR through proper intensification of the weights of interactions close to the known disease genes Network-based methods have been successfully exploiting this concept by capturing the interaction of genes or proteins into a score  Over the last years, computational approaches exploiting interaction network topology have been successfully applied to prioritize individual genes involved in diseases. Here, we propose a genome-wide network-based prioritization framework named GUILD The traditional approach to reduce the number of candidate genes entails fine-mapping studies using markers and pedigrees For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification.  hus, comparing the similarity between experimentally identified phenotypes and the phenotypes associated with human diseases can be used to suggest causal genes underlying a disease. In this manuscript, we present a method for disease gene prioritization based on comparing phenotypes of mouse models with those of human diseases. We present biomarker identification problem using gene prioritization method called gene prioritization from microarray data based on shortest paths, extended with structural and biological properties and edge flux using voting scheme (GP-MIDAS-VXEF). ensemble approach to microarray data-based gene prioritization after missing value imputation Recently, we have introduced the data mining tool ENDEAVOUR (Aerts et al., 2006), which performs this task automatically by relying on different genome-wide data sources, such as Gene Ontology, literature, microarray, sequence and more So far, biologists have relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine such an ordering We study the effect of different data integration methods, and based on the validation studies, we show that our approach, ToppGene http://toppgene.cchmc.org, outperforms two of the existing candidate gene prioritization methods, SUSPECTS and ENDEAVOU  Extending on an earlier hypothesis that the majority of genes that impact or cause disease share membership in any of several functional relationships we, for the first time, show the utility of mouse phenotype data in human disease gene prioritization We use co-expression data from yeast (S. cerevisiae), nematode worm (C. elegans), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), mouse and human and find that the use of evolutionary conservation can indeed improve the predictive value of co-expression Using a training set of genes known to be involved in a biological process of interest, our approach consists of (i) inferring several models (based on various genomic data sources), (ii) applying each model to the candidate genes to rank those candidates against the profile of the known genes and (iii) merging the several rankings into a global ranking of the candidate genes vocabularies, representations and ranking algorithms for gene prioritization by text mining Recently, text mining techniques have been applied to extract prior knowledge from text-based genomic information sources and this knowledge can be used to improve the prioritization process We present an approach to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms for further follow-up in genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes The proposed method combines both the use of open data access from two type 2 diabetes-genome-wide association studies (granted by the Diabetes Genetics Initiative and the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium) and the comprehensive analysis of candidate regions generated by the freely accessible ENDEAVOUR software. ToppGene Suite (http://toppgene.cchmc.org; this web site is free and open to all users and does not require a login to access) is a one-stop portal for (i) gene list functional enrichment, (ii) candidate gene prioritization using either functional annotations or network analysis and (iii) identification and prioritization of novel disease candidate genes in the interactome. The protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)-based disease candidate gene prioritization uses social and Web networks analysis algorithms (extended versions of the PageRank and HITS algorithms, and the K-Step Markov method) We present gene prioritization system (GPSy), a cross-species gene prioritization system that facilitates the arduous but critical task of prioritizing genes for follow-up functional analyses GPEC: a Cytoscape plug-in for random walk-based gene prioritization and biomedical evidence collection Among these, network-based approaches are recently proposed and outperformed functional annotation-based ones In the plug-in, gene prioritization is performed through a random walk with restart algorithm, a state-of-the art network-based method, along with a gene/protein relationship networ Here we present a multi-dimensional evidence-based candidate gene prioritization approach for complex diseases and demonstrate it in schizophrenia We present a multi-view approach to retrieve biomedical knowledge using different controlled vocabularies Given a query list, GeneMANIA extends the list with functionally similar genes that it identifies using available genomics and proteomics data Genomic linkage and association studies are commonly performed for identifying disease-related gene Here, we introduce MedSim, a novel approach for ranking candidate genes for a particular disease based on functional comparisons involving the Gene Ontology MedSim uses functional annotations of known disease genes for assessing the similarity of diseases as well as the disease relevance of candidate genes Here, we report a large-scale analysis of spatial, i.e. 3D, gene-expression data from an entire organ (the mouse brain) for the purpose of evaluating and ranking positional candidate genes, showing that the spatial gene-expression patterns can be successfully exploited for the prediction of gene-phenotype associations not only for mouse phenotypes, but also for human central nervous system-related Mendelian disorders In this paper, we propose an expandable framework for gene prioritization that can integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources by taking advantage of a unified graphic representation We demonstrate that existing methods are likely to favor highly connected genes, making prioritization sensitive to the skewed degree distribution of PPI networks, as well as ascertainment bias in available interaction and disease association data Motivated by this observation, we propose several statistical adjustment methods to account for the degree distribution of known disease and candidate genes, using a PPI network with associated confidence scores for interactions Here we employ a previously described method of candidate gene prioritization based mainly on gene annotation, in accompaniment with a technique based on the evaluation of pertinent sequence motifs or signatures, in an attempt to refine the gene prioritization approach. We introduce the novel GÃ©nie algorithm that overcomes these problems by evaluating the literature attached to all genes in a genome and to their orthologs according to a selected topic PINTA (available at http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/pinta/; this web site is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement) is a web resource for the prioritization of candidate genes based on the differential expression of their neighborhood in a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network We have recently developed a computational method for constitutional genetic disorders that identifies the most promising candidate genes by replacing prior knowledge by experimental data of differential gene expression between affected and healthy individual	[['network-based methods']]
532b15ecd6d3ac6a34000014	Which drugs have been found effective for the treatment of chordoma?	The combination treatment of bortezomib with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors increased the therapeutic potency in U-CH2 and patient-derived primary cultures. Vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, and fludarabine, each at a concentration of 10 Î¼M, decreased the number of chordoma cells when given alone down to 11%, 0%, 30%, 67%, and 3%, respectively. Etoposide and cisplatin, each at a concentration of 10 Î¼M, reduced the percentage of viable chordoma cells in a more effective way when given with 1 Î¼M ATRA simultaneously, reducing the number of viable cells to 14% and 9%, respectively. Percutaneous intratumoral injection with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion for the treatment of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas Preliminary results showed that PIIT with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion under fluoroscopic guidance is effective and safe and may be considered as a treatment option. Percutaneous intratumoral injection with pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion for treatment of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas During the follow-up (median time of 21.7 months, range 10-26 months), all the patients showed obviously reduced tumor size and VAS, and partial remission was achieved in 6 patients and stable disease (SD) in 1 patient. Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous intratumoral injection of PLE can be effective and safe and may serve as a alternative for treatment of recurrent sacrococcygeal chordomas. The expression of Stat3 signaling cascade was inhibited in all chordoma cell lines after treatment with SD-1029. The cytotoxicity of the combination of SD-1029 and chemotherapeutic drugs is significantly better than either agent alone. Phosphorylation of Stat3 in chordoma cells in vitro and cellular proliferation in three-dimensional culture were inhibited by SD-1029. In conclusion, the Stat3 pathway is constitutively activated in chordomas and the level of expression may serve as a predictor for prognosis. Blockade of the Stat3 pathway represents a potential strategy for future treatment.

Mice expressing the mutant thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1R384C, which has a 10-fold reduced affinity to the ligand T(3), exhibit hypermetabolism due to an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. To define the consequences in the liver, we analyzed hepatic metabolism and the regulation of liver genes in the mutant mice. Our results showed that hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase was up-regulated and pyruvate kinase mRNA down-regulated, contrary to what observed after T(3) treatment Remarkably, there was an obligatory requirement for a TR, whether TRbeta or TRalpha1, for any detectable D1 expression in liver.

This study investigated the lipid droplet coat proteins perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and perilipin 2 (PLIN2) localization in pig skeletal muscle and their relationship with intramuscular fat (IMF) content. Lipid droplets of mammalian cells are coated with one or more members of the PAT protein family, which serve important functions in regulating lipolysis. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which PAT family members, perilipin A, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), and LSDP5, control lipolysis catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a major lipase in adipocytes and several non-adipose cells. The coordination of lipid storage and utilization is regulated by the perilipin family of lipid droplet coat proteins [perilipin, adipophilin/adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP), S3-12, tail-interacting protein of 47 kilodaltons (TIP47), and myocardial lipid droplet protein (MLDP)/oxidative tissues-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT)/lipid storage droplet protein 5 (LSDP5)].

5319abe4b166e2b80600002e	Which transcription factors are involved in E-cadherin repression during EMT?	ifferential role of Snail1 and Snail2 zinc fingers in E-cadherin repression and epithelial to mesenchymal transition nail1 (Snail) and Snail2 (Slug) are transcription factors that share a similar DNA binding structure of four and five C2H2 zinc finger motifs (ZF), respectively. Both factors bind specifically to a subset of E-box motifs (E2-box: CAGGTG/CACCTG) in target promoters like the E-cadherin promoter and are key mediators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). hrombin induces slug-mediated E-cadherin transcriptional repression and the parallel up-regulation of N-cadherin by a transcription-independent mechanism in RPE cells We demonstrate, for the first time, that thrombin induces E-cadherin repression by stimulating snail-2 (SLUG) transcription factor expression, Mutation of the putative GSK-3Î² phosphorylation sites (S92/96A or S100/104A) enhanced the Slug/Snail2-mediated EMT properties of E-cadherin repression and vimentin induction, compared with wild-type Slug/Snail2. xpression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is often lost due to promoter DNA methylation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), Here, we identified that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA methylation.  We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC. 9a interacts with Snail and is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in human breast cancer Here, we have determined that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of E-cadherin in three TGF-Î²-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell lines. Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation. Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis. ZEB1, which targets E-cadherin repression, is a transcriptional regulator that has been implicated in EMT, and is associated with uterine and colorectal cancers. The introduction or knockdown of ZEB1 expression in bladder carcinoma cell lines showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasive potential, respectively. However, in vitro assays showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasion after the introduction or reduction of ZEB1, respectively, in transfected bladder cell lines. Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis. unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion. In most carcinomas, transcriptional repression has emerged as the main mechanism responsible for E-cadherin downregulation. Here, we report the identification of class I bHLH factor E2-2 (TCF4/ITF2) as a new EMT regulator. E-cadherin repression mediated by E2-2 is indirect and independent of proximal E-boxes of the promoter. Knockdown studies indicate that E2-2 expression is dispensable for maintenance of the EMT driven by Snail1 and E47. Slug mRNA was shown to be over-expressed in adenocarcinoma and inversely correlated to E-cadherin expression. Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin. SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression. eltaEF1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and regulates epithelial plasticity in breast cancer cells ownregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression. Using the EpFosER mammary tumour model we show that during EMT, upregulation of the transcriptional regulator deltaEF1 coincided with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT. Analysis of E-cadherin promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified deltaEF1 as direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human cancer cells, transcript levels of deltaEF1 correlated directly with the extent of E-cadherin repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of deltaEF1 in cancer cells was sufficient to derepress E-cadherin expression and restore cell to cell adhesion, suggesting that deltaEF1 is a key player in late stage carcinogenesis. TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1 promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression.  ETV5 modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in endometrial cell lines.	[['Snail1 (Snail)'], ['Snail2 (Slug)'], ['Zeb1'], ['Twist'], ['SIP1'], ['DeltaEF1']]
55391ce8bc4f83e828000018	Which signaling pathways have been associated with medulloblastoma formation and growth?	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is an important factor in growth and patterning during embryonic development. A mutation in Patched, Smoothened or Gli1, which regulate the Hh signaling pathway, might lead to the onset of glioblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma These data indicate that inhibition of Aurora Kinase A inhibits cell growth in medulloblastoma through inhibition of pro-proliferative signaling pathways Wnt, Myc, and RB Multiple signaling pathways have been associated with medulloblastoma formation and growth. These include the developmental pathways Hedgehog, (Hh) Notch, and Wnt as well as the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) c-Met, erbB2, IGF-R and TrkC, and the oncoprotein Myc Activation of neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC induces apoptosis in medulloblastomas Elevated expression of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor TrkC by childhood medulloblastomas is associated with favorable clinical outcome Considered collectively, these results support the conclusion that the biological actions of TrkC activation affect medulloblastoma outcome by inhibiting tumor growth through the promotion of apoptosis. During development, proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), candidate cells-of-origin for the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, requires signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the pathways of which are also implicated in medulloblastoma. Sonic hedgehog and insulin-like growth factor signaling synergize to induce medulloblastoma formation from nestin-expressing neural progenitors in mice. Ectopic expression of alpha and beta interferons in the developing brain also induces Shh-mediated medulloblastoma formation, suggesting a possible role for antiviral response in the genesis of medulloblastoma. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor. Sunitinib induces apoptosis and growth arrest of medulloblastoma tumor cells by inhibiting STAT3 and AKT signaling pathways. Aberrant activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways is associated with human medulloblastomas. N-myc can substitute for insulin-like growth factor signaling in a mouse model of sonic hedgehog-induced medulloblastoma. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor Aberrant expression/activation of EGFR is found in multiple human cancers, including medulloblastoma, the most prevalent pediatric brain cancer, and often has been associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and resistance to chemotherapy We emphasize the cancer-relevance of cilia-dependent signaling pathways and proteins including mTOR, VHL, TSC, WNT, Aurora-A, NEDD9, and Hedgehog, and highlight the emerging role of ciliary dysfunction in renal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer Here, we show that in medulloblastoma cells, both EGF and ouabain activate Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling Expression level of tumor/metastasis suppressive miRNAs in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas is likely to determine their response to treatment, and thus, these miRNAs would be important biomarkers for risk stratification within the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas. Aberrant activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways is associated with human medulloblastomas Shh-dependent medulloblastoma formation is enhanced by hyperactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and ectopic expression of Myc oncogenes Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signaling is activated in medulloblastoma cell proliferation and is associated with reduced expression of PTEN. A number of miRNAs like miR-193a, miR-224/miR-452 cluster, miR-182/miR-183/miR-96 cluster, and miR-148a having potential tumor/metastasis suppressive activity were found to be overexpressed in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas The requirement for SHH-Gli signaling in the growth of the mouse brain, together with the ability of inappropriate pathway activation in the cerebellum to cause medulloblastomas, and the inhibition of the growth of a number of brain tumors with cyclopamine, a SHH signaling inhibitor, underscores the critical role of the SHH-GLI pathway in brain growth and tumor formation Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway.

56c3327c50c68dd41600000c	Which DNA sequences are more prone for the formation of R-loops?	R-loops, transcriptionally-induced RNA:DNA hybrids, occurring at repeat tracts (CTG)n, (CAG)n, (CGG)n, (CCG)n and (GAA)n, are associated with diseases including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, fragile X and Friedreich's ataxia Double-R-loop formation and processing to instability was extended to the expanded C9orf72 (GGGGCC)Â·(GGCCCC) repeats, known to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, providing the first suggestion through which these repeats may become unstable.  Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes Furthermore, we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements R-loops associated with triplet repeat expansions Periodic DNA patrolling underlies diverse functions of Pif1 on R-loops and G-rich DNA Ginno et al. (2012) describe unusual sequence features at promoter CpG islands that can lead to formation of persistent RNA-DNA hybrids (R loops), which are proposed to prevent genomic DNA methylation R loops stimulate genetic instability of CTG.CAG repeats  We demonstrate, using biochemical and genetic approaches, that the formation of stable RNA.DNA hybrids enhances the instability of CTG.CAG repeat tracts.  The R-loop, previously characterized in vitro at the leading strand replication origin (OH), is isolated as a native RNA-DNA hybrid copurifying with mtDNA All of these R-loops arise upon generation of a G-rich RNA strand by an RNA polymerase upon transcription of a C-rich DNA template strand. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other R-loops We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5&apos;UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand which is rich in AT and not prone to form R-loops, Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other R-loops.

5518414a15fa47643f000001	Which gene(s) should be genotyped in order to prescribe the drug Cetuximab (anti-EGFR)?	Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with targeted anti-EGFR therapeutics such as cetuximab extends survival in only 25% of patients who test wild-type for KRAS, while the majority of patients prove resistant (J Clin Oncol 28(7):1254-1261, 2010). . Somatic mutation of the EGFR signalling pathway is a prevalent mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (Nature 486(7404):532-536, 2012). If the human genome harbours variants that influence susceptibility of the EGFR pathway to oncogenic mutation, such variants could also be prognostic for cetuximab responsiveness.  KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab.  KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab. KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies. The EGFR-R497K polymorphism is a potential predictor for overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab based therapy in the palliative setting. Laboratories are increasingly required to perform molecular tests for the detection of mutations in the KRAS gene in metastatic colorectal cancers to allow better clinical management and more effective treatment for these patients. KRAS mutation status predicts a patient's likely response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. KRAS mutation has been unambiguously identified as a marker of resistance to cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.   This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status. Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. KRAS mutation is a dramatic example of single nucleotide polymorphism, which is able to identify a priori patients that could receive or not an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab.  While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy. . This study suggests that TP53 mutations are predictive of cetuximab sensitivity, particularly in patients without KRAS mutation, and that TP53 genotyping could have a clinical interest to select patients who should benefit from cetuximab-based CT. A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line.  KRAS genotyping was recently introduced as predictive biomarker, since only tumors carrying a wildtype were found to respond to treatment with panitumumab.	[['KRAS'], ['EGFR'], ['BRAF'], ['T53']]
52f129d92059c6d71c000009	Which diseases are associated with Alu element insertion?	Alu elements are known to be the source of microsatellite repeats responsible for two other repeat expansion disorders: Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10. We identified an Alu-element insertion located in intron 7 of OPA1 causing an in-frame deletion of exon 8 in 18 family members. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy caused by mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene. However, this is the first report of a pathogenic OPA1 gene mutation resulting from an Alu insertion. The first reported case of Menkes disease caused by an Alu insertion mutation We present the first reported case of Menkes disease caused by an Alu element insertion mutation that interfered with splicing regulatory elements. HIGM syndrome caused by insertion of an AluYb8 element in exon 1 of the CD40LG gene A new mutation of the CD40LG gene that encodes the CD40 ligand molecule was characterized in a young patient harboring a hyper-IgM with immunodeficiency syndrome. Inactivation of CD40LG gene resulted from the insertion of an AluYb8 element in exon 1 responsible for a total deficiency of CD40 ligand expression by T lymphocytes. Alu-element insertion in the homeodomain of HESX1 and aplasia of the anterior pituitary One patient, who also has retinal coloboma, carries a HESX1 defect in the homozygous state: an Alu insertion in exon 3, a sequence that encodes the major part of the homeodomain. Anterior pituitary aplasia is a new example of a human disease caused by a germline retrotransposition event involving an Alu sequence. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with abnormal expansions of the CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of its gene.

Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) classified as long non-coding RNAs (Lnc-RNAs) are transcripts longer than 200-nt RNA with no protein-coding capacity. Previous studies showed that T-UCRs serve as novel oncogenes, or tumor suppressors are involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progressive. Nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and regulatory mechanism of T-UCRs in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. We found that uc.454 was downregulated in both non-small-cell LC (NSCLC) tissues and LCÂ cell lines, and the downregulated uc.454 is associated with tumor size and tumors with more advanced stages. Transfection with uc.454 markedly induced apoptosis andÂ inhibited cell proliferation in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H2170 LC cell lines. Above results suggested that uc.454 played a suppressive role in LC. Heat shock protein familyÂ A member 12B (HSPA12B) protein was negatively regulated by uc.454 at the posttranscriptional level by dual-luciferase reporter assay and affected the expressions of Bcl-2 family members, which finally induced LC apoptosis. The uc.454/HSPA12B axis furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor apoptosis, which may potentially serve as a therapeutic target for lung carcinoma. Transcribed ultraconserved region 339 promotes carcinogenesis by modulating tumor suppressor microRNAs. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) encode long non-coding RNAs implicated in human carcinogenesis. Their mechanisms of action and the factors regulating their expression in cancers are poorly understood. Here we show that high expression of uc.339 correlates with lower survival in 210 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We provide evidence from cell lines and primary samples that TP53 directly regulates uc.339. We find that transcribed uc.339 is upregulated in archival NSCLC samples, functioning as a decoy RNA for miR-339-3p, -663b-3p, and -95-5p. As a result, Cyclin E2, a direct target of all these microRNAs is upregulated, promoting cancer growth and migration. Finally, we find that modulation of uc.339 affects microRNA expression. However, overexpression or downregulation of these microRNAs causes noÂ significant variations in uc.339 levels, suggesting a type of interaction for uc.339 that we call "entrapping". Our results support a key role for uc.339 in lung cancer. Our results support a key role for uc.339 in lung cancer.

Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer of the endocrine system and is responsible for the majority of deaths from endocrine malignancies. Although a large proportion of thyroid cancers belong to well differentiated histologic subtypes, which in general show a good prognosis after surgery and radioiodine ablation, the treatment of radio-resistant papillary-type, of undifferentiated anaplastic, and of medullary-type thyroid cancers remains unsatisfactory Supervised hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated grouping of 2 histologies (papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma) FDG-PET/CT is also useful in the initial (post thyroidectomy) staging of high-risk patients with less differentiated (and thus less iodine-avid and clinically more aggressive) subtypes, such as tall cell variant and HÃ¼rthle cell carcinoma, but in particular poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinoma.

This inhibition correlated with the packaging of inhibitory APOBEC3 proteins into PFV virions, due to a specific PFV Gag/APOBEC3 interaction, and resulted in the G to A hypermutation of PFV reverse transcripts [Antiviral defense by APOBEC3 family proteins]. All APOBEC3 family proteins differentially inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition.

56be0e4aef6e394741000008	List Kartagener Syndrome Triad.	The triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis is known as Kartagener syndrome.  BACKGROUND: KARTAGENER SYNDROME (KS) IS A RARE CONGENITAL DISEASE CHARACTERISED BY A CLINICAL TRIAD OF SYMPTOMS: situs inversus, chronic rhinosinusitis, and bronchiectasis.  Kartagener's syndrome is a very rare congenital malformation comprising of a classic triad of sinusitis, situs inversus and bronchiectasis. We present a case of a patient with clinically definite ALS, who had earlier suffered from Kartagener syndrome, which is characterized by the triad comprising chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. Kartagener syndrome (KS), an autosomal recessively inherited disease, is characterized by the triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis. In 1933, Manes Kartagener, a Zurich pulmonary physician, reported four patients with the triad of sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. A case of a nine year and eight months old child with Kartagener's syndrome (triad) is described: chronic maxillary sinusitis, bronchiectasis and "situs inversus totalis". Kartagener's syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by a triad of symptoms--bronchiectasis, situs inversus and sinusitis--and is classified as an immotile cilia syndrome. Kartagener's syndrome is characterized by the clinical triad of bronchitis, sinusitis, and situs inversus. Kartagener's syndrome is a well known classical triad of presentations consisting of bronchiectasis, sinusitis and situs inversus. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the triad of situs inversus, including dextrocardia, bronchiectasis and paranasal sinusitis. Kartagener's syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by a triad of symptoms: bronchiectasis, situs inversus and sinusitis resulting from defective cilial motility. Ear, nose and throat symptoms and signs were studied in 15 patients with Kartagener's syndrome: a triad consisting of chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic bronchitis with bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. Kartagener syndrome (a clinical variant of primary ciliary dyskinesia) is a recessive autossomical disease characterized by the triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and situs inversus with dextrocardia Kartagener Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder consisting of triad of sinusitis, bronchiectasis and situs inversus with dextrocardia Kartagener syndrome (KS), an autosomal recessively inherited disease, is characterized by the triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis Kartagener&apos;s syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by a triad of symptoms--bronchiectasis, situs inversus and sinusitis--and is classified as an immotile cilia syndrome Kartagener&apos;s syndrome is a very rare congenital malformation comprising of a classic triad of sinusitis, situs inversus and bronchiectasis A comprehensive clinicomorphological examination of 24 children with Zivert-Kartagener syndrome ascertained the complete triad (bronchiectasis, maldevelopment of the sinuses and transposition of the viscera) in all of them The triad situs viscerum inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis is known as Kartagener syndrome We present a case of a patient with clinically definite ALS, who had earlier suffered from Kartagener syndrome, which is characterized by the triad comprising chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus.

5322d3cb9b2d7acc7e000010	Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?	Inhibition of HDAC6 deacetylase activity increases its binding with microtubules and suppresses microtubule dynamic instability in MCF-7 cells HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions. Moreover, acetylation of Î±-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). MEC-17 deficiency leads to reduced Î±-tubulin acetylation and impaired migration of cortical neurons MEC-17 is a newly discovered Î±-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of Î±-tubulin in different species in vivo. Thus, MEC-17, which regulates the acetylation of Î±-tubulin, appears to control the migration and morphological transition of cortical neurons. This finding reveals the importance of MEC-17 and Î±-tubulin acetylation in cortical development. NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an Î±-tubulin deacetylase. Moreover, Î±-tubulin acetylation levels of microtubules specifically extending into the terminal synaptic boutons are reduced in response to dTip60 HAT reduction. In this study, angiotensin II induced disassembly and deacetylation of Î±-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using RNA interference. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced vascular remodeling. Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic microtubule dynamics can be explained by impaired histone deacetylase 6 function Addition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold). Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules. We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells. The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform. Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration. Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin	[['MEC-17'], ['SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2)'], ['HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6)'], ['dTip60']]

531b3ff3b166e2b80600003d	Which proteins are related to the loss of cell-cell adhesion during EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)?	conserved polarity proteins Par6 and aPKC regulate cell polarization processes  In addition to signaling pathways that alter genetic programes that trigger the loss of cell-cell adhesion, alternative pathways can alter cell plasticity to regulate cell-cell cohesion and increase invasive potential One such pathway involves TGFÎ²-induced phosphorylation of Par6 Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT Numb has been shown to play an important role in the proper functions of Par protein complex and in cell-cell junctions, both of which are associated with EMT Recently, we showed that Numb is capable of binding to both Par3 and E-cadherin Knockdown of Numb by shRNA in MDCK cells led to a lateral to apical translocation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, active F-actin polymerization, mis-localization of Par3 and aPKC, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and an increase in cell migration and proliferation This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1. EGF induces EMT in the breast cancer cell line PMC42-LA and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (ST) induces EMT in embryonic neural epithelial cells, with F-actin de-bundling and disruption of cell-cell adhesion, via inhibition of aPKC ST in combination with EGF directed a greater EMT via actin depolymerisation and focal contact size reduction, resulting in a loosening of cell-ECM attachment along with Snail1-Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by several inducers of EMT, in particular the ZEB and Snail factors, downregulate the expression and/or functional organization of core polarity complexes TGFbeta has pleiotropic effects that range from regulation of proliferation and apoptosis to morphological changes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) Morphological changes were accompanied by decrease in E-cadherin and increased Snail expression but the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, SMAalpha and Vimentin) studied remained unchanged Neutralising E-cadherin function promoted the invasion and inhibited the aggregation of endocrine-sensitive MCF7 cells, whilst having little effect on the behaviour of TamR cells	[['ZEB'], ['SNAIL'], ['SIRT1'], ['EGF'], ['TGFb'], ['aPKC'], ['Par6']]
5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e	Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads	mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads? RNA-Seq is currently used routinely, and it provides accurate information on gene transcription. However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results.RESULTS: We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads?mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.

List the most frequent carbapenemases found in Enterobacteriaceae.	The most frequent carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae were OXA-48, KPC and VIM-1; in P. aeruginosa it was VIM-2 and in A. baumannii OXA-23. bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM) and bla(GIM), and of bla(KPC), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA- Detection of NDM-1, VIM-1, KPC, OXA-48, and OXA-162 carbapenemases by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The Check-MDR CT102 DNA microarray enables detection of the most prevalent carbapenemases (NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP) 63 KPC producers, 47 MBL producers, and 31 KPC and MBL producers OXA-48 producers were poorly detected, but all systems reliably detected isolates with KPC and most with metallo-carbapenemases. Producers of IMP-, VIM-, and KPC-type carbapenemases with high levels of resistance to cephalosporins and to carbapenems were detected at 1x10(1) CFU/ml. The OXA-48 producers were not detected on ChromID ESBL medium unless coexpressing ESBLs, whereas carbapenemase-producing isolates with MICs of <4 microg/ml were not detected on CHROMagar KPC medium. The most frequent carbapenemase was KPC-2 or -3 (73 strains), followed by VIM-1 (14), IMP-1 (11), SME-2 (5), and NMC-A (1). All serine carbapenemases were detected in the United States, while MbetaL-producing strains were isolated in Europe. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of resistance to most antimicrobial agents tested. By using this methodology, isolates producing KPC, GES, Sme, IMI, and NMC-A carbapenemases were successfully distinguished from those producing other classes of beta-lactamases KPC-2 and KPC-3 were the most frequently occurring carbapenemases (24 isolates, 20.2%) i K. pneumoniae strains with known KPC (nâ€ƒ=â€ƒ31) or VIM (nâ€ƒ=â€ƒ20) carbapenemases Carbapenemases including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) are widespread among clinical isolates in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Outbreak of vim-1-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae in a pediatric intensive care unit. mergence of pediatric infections caused by carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a critical issue as they are resistant to most Î²-lactam antibiotics. SME-2-producing S. marcescens were isolated in the New York City area, Texas, and Ohio, while NMC-A was found in one E. cloacae strain from New York. In contrast, metallo-beta-lactamases were prevalent in Europe. IMP-1-producing E. cloacae (11 isolates) were detected in Turkey, while VIM-1-producing strains were found in Italy (Enterobacter spp.) and Greece (Klebsiella pneumoniae). d several simple confirmatory methods that allow the recognition of bacteria producing class A carbapenemases, including KPC, Sme, IMI, NMC-A, and GES,	[['OXA-48'], ['KPC'], ['VIM'], ['NDM'], ['IMP'], ['SME'], ['NMC'], ['GES'], ['IMI'], ['MBL']]
