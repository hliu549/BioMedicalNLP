56af9f130a360a5e45000015	Where is the protein Pannexin1 located?	zfPanx1 was identified on the surface of horizontal cell dendrites invaginating deeply into the cone pedicle near the glutamate release sites of the cones, providing in vivo evidence for hemichannel formation at that location. pannexin1, a vertebrate homolog of invertebrate gap junction proteins. The specific profile of gap junction proteins, the connexins, expressed in these different cell types forms compartments of intercellular communication that can be further shaped by the release of extracellular nucleotides via pannexin1 channels.  Recent studies demonstrated that ATP can be released from cells in a controlled manner through pannexin (Panx) channels. The ATP release channel Pannexin1 (Panx1) is self-regulated The membrane protein Pannexin1 forms two open-channel conformations depending on the mode of activation.  Pannexin1 channels traffic to the plasma membrane. We previously showed that pannexins form oligomeric channels but unlike connexins and innexins, they form only single membrane channels. ATP release channel Pannexin1  Pannexin1 (Panx1) is a newly discovered extracellular ATP release channel with a wide tissue distribution and diverse biological functions in mammals. In mammals, a single pannexin1 gene (Panx1) is widely expressed in the CNS including the inner and outer retinae, forming large-pore voltage-gated membrane channels, which are involved in calcium and ATP signaling.  Six of them form a "gap junction hemichannel-like" structure that connects the cytoplasm with the extracellular space; here they will be called Panx1 channels. These are poorly selective channels permeable to ions, small metabolic substrate, and signaling molecules.	['plasma membrane']
52bf1b0a03868f1b06000009	What is the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease?	The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain.  The inheritance is autosomal recessive.  Wilson's disease (WD), or hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive inheritance disorder of copper metabolism caused by ATP7B gene mutation.  Inheritance seems most likely to be autosomal recessive When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20.  Inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause such copper accumulation in WD; reducing the dietary intake of copper cannot prevent the development of WD.  Wilson's disease is a treatable movement disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance which is associated with severe morbidity and mortality if not treated early.  The patient was considered heterozygote for hemochromatosis on the basis of the autosomal recessive inheritance for hemochromatosis, the frequency of the hemochromatosis gene, and the laboratory parameters defining her iron overload.  Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation leading to liver and/or brain damage.  Autosomal recessive inheritance indicates that siblings of affected patients are at 25% risk of having the disease.  Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with autosomal recessive inheritance. Recessive inheritance is, however, supported.  The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance strongly suggests that mutation of a single gene causes the impairment of both caeruloplasmin synthesis and biliary copper excretion. This is consistent with the autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance The overall sex ratio of patients was nearly 1:1, and genetic analysis of 20 families confirmed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.  Dermatoglyphics of 11 patients with Wilson's disease and 16 of their clinically asymptomatic relatives of first degree were investigated; 11 of the latter ones were heterozygous in agreement with the turn over rates of Cu-67, 12 under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance.

52bf19c503868f1b06000001	What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?	autosomal dominant FSHD1 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement, and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by weakness of the face, upper arm, shoulder, and lower limb musculature, with an onset between the first and third decades.  Clinical diagnosis is made from the distinctive pattern of weakness, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and confirmed by genetic testing.  In one family together with prenatal diagnosis founder mutation in FSHD A1 gene was detected, according to the autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance remarkable for its early involvement of facial musculature. Consensual diagnostic criteria for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) include onset of the disease in facial or shoulder girdle muscles, facial weakness in more than 50% of affected family members, autosomal dominant inheritance in familial cases, and evidence of myopathic disease in at least one affected member without biopsy features specific to alternative diagnoses Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant muscular disorder associated with a short (<35 kb) EcoRI/BlnI fragment resulting from deletion of an integral number of units of a 3.3-kb repeat located at 4q35. In 139 families, dominant inheritance was observed in 97, a pattern compatible with germline mosaicism in 6, while sporadic cases were found in 36 families.

56e2cec751531f7e33000015	What is the structural fold of bromodomain proteins?	These new studies also support the notion that functional diversity of a conserved bromodomain structural fold is achieved by evolutionary changes of structurally flexible amino-acid sequences in the ligand binding site such as the ZA and BC loops. Although the overall fold resembles the bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences can be found in loop regions, especially in the ZA loop in which a two amino acids insertion is involved in an uncommon pi-helix, termed piD In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal bromodomain (BD1, residues 74-194) of human BRD2. This is the first observation of a homodimer among the known bromodomain structures, through the buried hydrophobic core region at the interface. The Brg1 bromodomain conserves the left-handed, four-helix bundle topology found in other bromodomain structures. However, the alphaZ helix of Brg1 bromodomain is about 4 residues shorter relative to previously published bromodomain structures. Here, we report the solution structure of BRD7 bromodomain determined by NMR spectroscopy, and its binding specificity revealed by NMR titration with several acetylated histone peptides. The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of the double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side, four-helix bundles with a highly polarized surface charge distribution The structure has a left-handed four-helix bundle topology, with two short additional helices in a long connecting loop. The structure reveals an unusual left-handed up-and-down four-helix bundle.  In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein.

Jun and Fos transcriptional activities are also regulated by phosphorylation as a result of the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. In this regard, the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-induced JNK has been readily documented, whereas a role for Fos proteins in UV-mediated responses and the identification of Fos-activating kinases has remained elusive An in vitro kinase assay revealed that the resultant c-Jun phosphorylation was primarily mediated via activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway forms part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways comprising a sequential three-tiered kinase cascade.  The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and are activated by environmental stress. JNK phosphorylates and regulates the activity of transcription factors other than c-Jun, including ATF2, Elk-1, p53 and c-Myc and non-transcription factors, such as members of the Bcl-2 family. A candidate for this extended family of MAP kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and Ser-73. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that the resultant c-Jun phosphorylation was primarily mediated via activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) A candidate for this extended family of MAP kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and Ser-73	['c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase', 'JNK']

It is important to identify what proteins are substrates of proteases and where their cleavage sites are so as to reveal the molecular mechanisms and specificity of signaling.  It is important to identify what proteins are substrates of proteases and where their cleavage sites are so as to reveal the molecular mechanisms and specificity of signaling. analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence. Several approaches to studying proteolytic activity as it relates to biology, pathophysiology, and drug therapy have been published, including the recently described terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) strategy by Kleifeld and colleagues  The degradomics screen terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), which enriches for neo-N-terminal peptides of cleaved substrates, was used to identify 58 new native substrates in fibroblast secretomes after incubation with MT6-MMP.   Here we present in detail the steps required to perform our recently described approach we call Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS), a combined N-terminomics and protease substrate discovery degradomics platform for the simultaneous quantitative and global analysis of the N-terminome and proteolysis in one MS/MS experiment.  Identification of proteolytic products and natural protein N-termini by Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS).  Incorporating iTRAQ whole protein labeling with terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) to enrich the N-terminome by negative selection of the blocked mature original N-termini and neo-N-termini has many advantages.

552fac4fbc4f83e828000006	Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. It is driven by oncogenic fusion proteins (i.e. EWS/FLI1) acting as aberrant transcription factors that upregulate and downregulate target genes, leading to cellular transformation EWS/FLI-1 oncoprotein subtypes impose different requirements for transformation and metastatic activity in a murine model Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (EWS/PNET) are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations most often generating a chimeric EWS/FLI-1 gene The resulting EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein is believed to behave as an aberrant transcriptional activator that contributes to ESFT development by altering the expression of its target genes in a permissive cellular environment Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor The orphan nuclear receptor DAX1 is up-regulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and is highly expressed in Ewing tumors The Ewing family of tumors harbors chromosomal translocations that join the N-terminal region of the EWS gene with the C-terminal region of several transcription factors of the ETS family, mainly FLI1, resulting in chimeric transcription factors that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Ewing tumors. To identify downstream targets of the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, we established 293 cells expressing constitutively either the chimeric EWS/FLI1 or wild type FLI1 proteins and used cDNA arrays to identify genes differentially regulated by EWS/FLI1 The high levels of DAX1 found in Ewing tumors and its potent transcriptional repressor activity suggest that the oncogenic effect of EWS/FLI1 may be mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulation of DAX1 expression Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are highly aggressive and highly metastatic tumors caused by a chromosomal fusion between the Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS) with the transcription factor FLI-1. EWS-FLI1 is a fusion protein that results from the pathognomonic translocation of Ewing sarcoma (ES). Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma. Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Blocking the road, stopping the engine or killing the driver? Advances in targeting EWS/FLI-1 fusion in Ewing sarcoma as novel therapy. Fusion of the EWS gene to FLI1 produces a fusion oncoprotein that drives an aberrant gene expression program responsible for the development of Ewing sarcoma. Mosaic expression of the human EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in zebrafish caused the development of tumors with histology strongly resembling that of human Ewings sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of aggressive pediatric malignancies driven by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor up-regulating specific target genes, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 and Y5 receptors (Y5Rs). Ewing sarcoma is primarily caused by a t(11;22) chromosomal translocation encoding the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. The EWS-ETS fusion is causative in the development of Ewing's tumour. The resulting EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein is believed to behave as an aberrant transcriptional activator that contributes to ESFT development by altering the expression of its target genes in a permissive cellular environment. EWS-FLI1 is an oncogenic fusion protein implicated in the development of Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma Together, our data reveal that EWSAT1 is a downstream target of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes Thus, we developed a highly validated transcriptional profile for the EWS/FLI fusion protein and identified a critical target gene in Ewing's sarcoma development. Our understanding of Ewing's sarcoma development mediated by the EWS/FLI fusion protein has been limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the tumor cell of origin Ewing's sarcomas are characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations expressing EWS-ETS fusion proteins, the most common of which is EWS-FLI.(1-5) EWS-FLI is an oncogenic transcription factor that regulates genes involved in tumorigenesis.(6,7) Because the Ewing's sarcoma cell of origin remains unknown, a variety of model systems have been developed to study EWS-FLI fusions,(8-14) and multiple microarray experiments describing potential EWS-FLI target genes have been reported.(8,10,11,13,15-21) Each model has potential benefits and drawbacks, but a large-scale comparison of these has not been reported Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein	['EWS/FLI1']

54e0d1491388e8454a000014	Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?	Efficacy and safety profile of evolocumab (AMG145), an injectable inhibitor of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9: the available clinical evidence. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Efficacy and safety of evolocumab (AMG 145), a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, in hyperlipidaemic patients on various background lipid therapies: pooled analysis of 1359 patients in four phase 2 trials. We report a pooled analysis from four phase 2 studies of evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9.  Reduction in lipoprotein(a) with PCSK9 monoclonal antibody evolocumab (AMG 145): a pooled analysis of more than 1,300 patients in 4 phase II trials. METHODS: A pooled analysis of data from 1,359 patients in 4 phase II trials assessed the effects of evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, on Lp(a), the relationship between Lp(a) and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the influence of background statin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab resulted in significant dose-related reductions in Lp(a).  Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, including evolocumab (previously AMG 145), dramatically lowered LDL-C in phase 2 clinical trials when administered alone or in combination with a statin.  Evolocumab (AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9, inhibiting its interaction with the LDL receptor to preserve LDL-receptor recycling and reduce LDL-C. Antibody therapeutics in Phase 3 studies are described, with an emphasis on those with study completion dates in 2014, including antibodies targeting interleukin-17a or the interleukin-17a receptor (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (alirocumab, evolocumab, bococizumab), and programmed death 1 receptor (lambrolizumab, nivolumab). BACKGROUND: Evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in phase 2 studies of 12 weeks' duration.  These compounds act either by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) production by inhibiting apolipoprotein B synthesis with an antisense oligonucleotide (mipomersen) or by inhibiting microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (lomitapide), or by enhancing LDL catabolism via monoclonal antibody-mediated inhibition of the activity of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) (evolocumab).  Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (TESLA Part B): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), reduced LDL cholesterol by 16% in a pilot study.  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (RUTHERFORD-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We investigated the effect of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with this disorder.  Some of the anti-dyslipidemic drugs which work by PCSK9 inhibition include evolocumab, alirocumab and ALN-PCS. We highlight the different steps of this adventure and review the published clinical trials especially those with the anti-PCSK9 antibodies evolocumab (AMG 145) and alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727), which are in phase III trials. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 represent so far the most advanced approach in clinical development, with alirocumab, evolocumab and bococizumab under advanced clinical development.  AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and back pain.  Four classes of newer lipid-lowering drugs offer promising advances in treating FH, namely the apolipoprotein-B synthesis inhibitors (mipomersen), the microsomal transfer protein inhibitors (lomitapide), the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (anacetrapib, evacetrapib) and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab). Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades the LDL receptor, like alirocumab and evolocumab, are in phase 3 trials. In support of the drug development program for Evolocumab, a fully human IgG₂ antibody that targets PCSK9, a quantitative ELISA to measure free PCSK9 in human serum was developed.  IMPORTANCE: In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.  Anti-PCSK9 antibody effectively lowers cholesterol in patients with statin intolerance: the GAUSS-2 randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of evolocumab.

51404dd723fec90375000002	What is the methyl donor of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases?	The product of the dcm gene is the only DNA cytosine-C5 methyltransferase of Escherichia coli K-12; it catalyses transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the C-5 position of the inner cytosine residue of the cognate sequence CCA/TGG.  Deoxycytosine methylase (Dcm) enzyme activity causes mutagenesis in vitro either directly by enzyme-induced deamination of cytosine to uracil in the absence of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), or indirectly through spontaneous deamination of [5-methyl]cytosine to thymine In the absence of DNA substrate, the DNA methyltransferase (MTase) M.BspRI can methylate itself using the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). The methyl group is transferred to two Cys residues of the MTase. The reaction is fairly insensitive to the methyl donor in the reaction, S-adenosylmethionine. Formation of the complex was dependent upon the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting that it comprises an enzyme-linked 5-substituted dihydrocytosine moiety in DNA.  The DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (m5C-MTase) M.BspRI is able to accept the methyl group from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) in the absence of DNA. Transfer of the methyl group to the enzyme is a slow reaction relative to DNA methylation. S Here, we report the structure of HhaI methyltransferase in complex with DNA containing a south-constrained abasic carbocyclic sugar at the target site in the presence of the methyl donor byproduct AdoHcy.

551c23bc6b348bb82c00000b	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the familial isolated pituitary adenoma?	The cause of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) remains unknown in a high percentage of cases, but the AIP gene plays an important role in the etiology.  Familial isolated pituitary adenoma caused by a Aip gene mutation not described before in a family context. We report a Spanish family with FIPA in whom a mutation in the AIP gene previously unreported in a familiar context was identified. FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families. Understanding the tumorigenic process in AIP-positive and AIP-negative FIPA patients could result in better diagnostic and treatment options for both familial and sporadic cases. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene has a major role in the pathogenesis of familial isolated pituitary adenoma.  The discovery of heterozygous, loss-of-function germline mutations in the gene encoding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) in 2006 has subsequently enabled the identification of a mutation in this gene in 20% of FIPA families and 20% of childhood-onset simplex soma- totroph adenomas.  This review aims to summarize currently available clinical data on AIP mutation-positive and negative FIPA patients. [Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene and familial isolated pituitary adenomas]. Many heterozygous mutations have been discovered in AIP in about 20% of FIPA families.  Germline mutations of aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor interacting protein (AIP) are associated with pituitary adenoma predisposition. They occur in 20 % of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) and in about 3-5 % of sporadic pituitary adenomas, especially in early onset somatotropinomas and prolactinomas.  We report a FIPA family harbouring an AIP R16H change, supporting the hypothesis that the latter represents a variant of unknown significance. Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds.  Genetic analysis in a patient presenting with meningioma and familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) reveals selective involvement of the R81X mutation of the AIP gene in the pathogenesis of the pituitary tumor. About 20 % of the families with FIPA harbor inactivating mutation in aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene (AIP) associated with loss of heterozygosity of the same genetic locus (11q13) in the tumor. Rarely different types of extra-pituitary tumors have been described in the setting of AIP mutation-positive FIPA.  Mutations in AIP account only for 15-25% of FIPA families.  In 20-40% of families with this syndrome, mutations have been identified in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene while in the rest of the families the causative gene or genes have not been identified.  Germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene (AIP) predispose to young-onset pituitary tumours, most often to GH- or prolactin-secreting adenomas, and most of these patients belong to familial isolated pituitary adenoma families. We also briefly describe the genetic basis of three other inherited states predisposing individuals to endocrine tumors, namely Carney's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism type 2 (HRPT2) and familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which are related to inactivating mutations in the PRKAR1-alpha, HRPT2 and AIP genes, respectively. The identification of mutations in the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) cases has recently expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited pituitary adenoma disorders. Several studies and reviews have assessed the genetic and clinical features of AIP-mutated FIPA patients, which range from a complete lack of symptoms in adult/elderly individuals to large, aggressive early-onset pituitary tumors. In 20% of FIPA families, heterozygous mutations have been described in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting (AIP) gene, whereas in other families the causative gene(s) are unknown. A novel C-terminal nonsense mutation, Q315X, of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein gene in a Japanese familial isolated pituitary adenoma family. Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) and the pituitary adenoma predisposition due to mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene. Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds. Mutations of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene are associated with pituitary adenomas that usually occur as familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA). Clinical experience in the screening and management of a large kindred with familial isolated pituitary adenoma due to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) mutation. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) gene variants in AIP mutation-negative familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds. Although the cause of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) remains unknown in many cases, germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene were identified in approximately 20 % of families with FIPA The cause of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) remains unknown in a high percentage of cases, but the AIP gene plays an important role in the etiology FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families Germline mutations in the aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein gene are identified in around 25% of familial isolated pituitary adenoma kindreds The identification of mutations in the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) cases has recently expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited pituitary adenoma disorders To date, the number of molecular genetic factors unequivocally linked to pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers of one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (2) the MENIN and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (3) mutations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% of familial isolated acromegaly	['aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein']

Telomerase (GV1001) vaccination together with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. A study was conducted to investigate safety and immunogenicity in non-resectable pancreatic carcinoma patients using a 16-amino acid telomerase peptide (GV1001) for vaccination in combination with GM-CSF and gemcitabine as first line treatment.  Telomerase vaccination (GV1001) in combination with chemotherapy appeared to be safe but the immune responses were weak and transient.  Gemcitabine and capecitabine with or without telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (TeloVac): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential or simultaneous telomerase vaccination (GV1001) in combination with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Novel vaccine peptide GV1001 effectively blocks β-amyloid toxicity by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects. Peptide GV1001 is a peptide vaccine representing a 16-amino acid human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence, which has been reported to possess potential antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory activity.  Based on this review, the most promising current telomerase targeting therapeutics are the antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor GRN163L and immunotherapies that use dendritic cells (GRVAC1), hTERT peptide (GV1001) or cryptic peptides (Vx-001). A reverse-transcriptase-subunit of telomerase (hTERT) derived peptide, GV1001, has been developed as a vaccine against various cancers. Of the increasing number of immunological agents, the GV1001 antitelomerase vaccine holds some interest.

550af222c2af5d5b7000000b	Which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates IkB leading to its proteasomal degradation?	IKK activation and IκB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, β-TrCP, recognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples IκB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TrCP) -mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP results in accumulation of all the IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition.  Sequence comparison analysis showed sequence motif identity between CLU and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), a main E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IkappaB-alpha degradation. IkappaB degradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we show that beta-catenin stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein betaTrCP1, and identify the RNA-binding protein CRD-BP (coding region determinant-binding protein) as a previously unknown target of beta-catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRD-BP binds to the coding region of betaTrCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRD-BP stabilizes betaTrCP1 mRNA and elevates betaTrCP1 levels (both in cells and in vivo), resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)(betaTrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including IkappaB and beta-catenin.  The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation.

56c1f03bef6e394741000053	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome?	 The disorder is caused by mutations to the NKX2.1 (TITF1) gene and also forms part of the "brain-lung-thyroid syndrome", in which additional developmental abnormalities of lung and thyroid tissue are observed.  Novel NKX2-1 Frameshift Mutations in Patients with Atypical Phenotypes of the Brain-Lung-Thyroid Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To verify the involvement of NKX2-1 gene in infants with brain-lung-thyroid (BLT) syndrome and hypothyroid phenotypes variable among congenital hypothyroidism (CH) or idiopathic mild hypothyroidism (IMH) of postnatal onset. They were carriers of new de novo heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 (c.177delG and c.153_166del14). CONCLUSIONS: Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 were identified in 2 cases selected on the basis of a BLT-like phenotype among 183 hypothyroid infants.  NKX2-1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: a case series of four patients. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (BLTS) characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, respiratory distress syndrome, and benign hereditary chorea is caused by thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TTF1) mutations. Two of the four patients presenting with the triad of BLTS had NKX2-1 mutations, and one of these NKX2-1 [c.890_896del (p.Ala327Glyfs*52)] is a novel variant. The third patient without any identified NKX2-1 mutations was a carrier of mitochondrial mutation; this raises the possibility of mitochondrial mutations contributing to thyroid dysgenesis. Although rare, the triad of congenital hypothyroidism, neurological, and respiratory signs is highly suggestive of NKX2-1 anomalies. Screening for NKX2-1 mutations in patients with thyroid, lung, and neurological abnormalities will enable a unifying diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected families. In addition, identification of an NKX2-1 defect would be helpful in allaying the concerns about inadequate thyroxine supplementation as the cause of neurological defects observed in some children with congenital hypothyroidism. Loss-of-function mutations in NKX2.1, a gene vital to the normal development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid, have been identified in a number of individuals. BACKGROUND: NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. CONCLUSION: MLPA should be considered as a complementary tool in patients with partial or total brain-lung-thyroid syndrome when direct sequencing failed to identify NKX2.1 mutations.  Mutations in NKX2-1 cause neurological, pulmonary, and thyroid hormone impairment. Recently, the disease was named brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  Genetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in two patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb deletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient. Congenital hypothyroidism was not detected on neonatal screening in the patient with the missense mutation, and frequent respiratory infections were observed in the patient with the deletion in NKX2-1.  Haploinsufficiency of NKX2.1, the gene encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)--critical for lung, thyroid and central nervous system morphogenesis and function--causes a rare form of progressive respiratory failure designated brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  We report a novel TTF-1 molecular defect causing recurrent respiratory failure episodes in an infant. In conclusion, ILD in patients with NKX2-1 mutations was associated with altered surfactant protein metabolism, and both gain and loss of function of the mutated NKX2-1 genes on surfactant protein promoters were associated with ILD in "Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome". Thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TITF1) mutations cause brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, characterized by congenital hypothyroidism (CH), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC). The objectives of the present study were (i) detection of NKX2-1 mutations in patients with CH associated with pneumopathy and/or BHC, (ii) functional analysis of new mutations in vitro and (iii) description of the phenotypic spectrum of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Five new TTF1/NKX2.1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: rescue by PAX8 synergism in one case. NKX2-1 mutations leading to surfactant protein promoter dysregulation cause interstitial lung disease in "Brain-Lung-Thyroid Syndrome". Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification improves the detection rate of NKX2.1 mutations in patients affected by brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. The clinical spectrum of 6 own and 40 published patients with NKX2-1 mutations ranged from the complete triad of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (50%), brain and thyroid disease (30%), to isolated BHC (13%).

532498959b2d7acc7e000017	Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?	Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. In preclinical trials, this compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo xenograft mouse models.  In addition to the inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines, GRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changes, independent of hTR expression or telomere length. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths  Telomerase extension is less processive during the first few weeks following the reversal of long-term treatment with the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L), a time when Cajal bodies fail to deliver telomerase RNA to telomeres. The role of telomerase as an immunotherapy, as a gene therapy approach using telomerase promoter driven oncolytic viruses and as a small oligonucleotide targeted therapy (Imetelstat) will be discussed We then tested the efficacy of the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat on propagation and self-renewal capacity of TIC and normal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. R e telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC. Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase. Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo.  Short oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate conjugated to 5'-palmitoyl group, designated as GRN163L (Imetelstat), was recently introduced as a potent human telomerase inhibitor etelstat (GRN163L)--telomerase-based cancer therapy. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical trials. e telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, efficiently targets glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells leading to decreased proliferation and tumor growth. The effects of a novel human telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, on primary human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor-initiating cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo.  Imetelstat treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase (IC(50) 0.45 micromol/L). Long-term imetelstat treatment led to progressive telomere shortening, reduced rates of proliferation, and eventually cell death in GBM tumor-initiating cells.  We have found that prostate TICs have significant telomerase activity which is inhibited by imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), a new telomerase antagonist that is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for several hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Prostate TICs telomeres were of similar average length to the telomeres of the main population of cells and significant telomere shortening was detected in prostate TICs as a result of imetelstat treatment.  Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor.	['Human Telomerase']

531a34d5b166e2b806000036	Which gene is required for the efficient function of clopidogrel?	The CYP2C19 G681A single polymorphism has been proven to affect clopidogrel responsiveness.  This study investigated the effect of coexisting polymorphisms of CYP2C19 and P2Y12 on clopidogrel responsiveness and adverse clinical events in Chinese patient ssociation of a functional polymorphism in the clopidogrel target receptor gene, P2Y12 We tested for an association of gene sequence variations in P2Y12 and occurrence of neurological adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) during clopidogrel treatment Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP] family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12) Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  The prodrug clopidogrel requires activation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes for its antiplatelet effect Carriers of the CYP2C19*2 and *4 alleles showed reduced platelet inhibition after a clopidogrel 600-mg loading dose but responded to higher loading and maintenance dose regimens Carriers of the CYP2C19*17 T-allele, with increased clopidogrel activation, had a 37% relative reduction in the TLR incidence, the primary end point The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel and poor clinical outcome after stent implantation From these results it is suggested that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with subclinical thrombus formation among Japanese patients receiving clopidogrel.  To determine the effect of various SNPs on post-clopidogrel platelet reactivity and clinical outcome. MATERIALS & METHODS: Cytochrome 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function (LOF; *2, *3) and gain-of-function (GOF; *17) allelic variants, together with ABCB1 (3435 C→T and 2677 G→T/A) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1; 192 Q→R) SNPs were analyzed in 189 patients after elective stent implantation who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00638326) Chinese people are more frequent carriers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function alleles than Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 variants on clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in these patients The risk of a low response to clopidogrel and composite ischemic events increased with the number of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. However, there were not significant differences in clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes across the ABCB1 and PON1 genotype groups; bleeding was not significantly different across the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 genotype groups The CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles had a gene dose effect on the pharmacodynamics and composite ischemic events of clopidogrel in our study population. Neither the ABCB1 nor the PON1 genotype significantly influenced the antiplatelet effect and clinical outcomes of clopidogrel in these patients	['cytochrome P450, CYPC19']
56cdf40d5795f9a73e00003d	Which transcription factor is considered as a master regulator of lysosomal genes?	In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controlling activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression Interaction of TFEB with active Rag heterodimers promoted recruitment of TFEB to lysosomes, leading to mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of TFEB Depletion or inactivation of Rags prevented recruitment of TFEB to lysosomes, whereas expression of active Rags induced association of TFEB with lysosomal membranes The identification of a master regulator, transcription factor EB (TFEB), that regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy has revealed how the lysosome adapts to environmental cues, such as starvation, and targeting TFEB may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating lysosomal function in human disease TFEB regulates lysosomal proteostasis Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, in modulating lysosomal proteostasis in LSDs our findings identify TFEB as a specific regulator of lysosomal proteostasis the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is induced by starvation through an autoregulatory feedback loop and exerts a global transcriptional control on lipid catabolism A lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism senses and regulates the lysosome via mTOR and TFEB. the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane the lysosome senses its content and regulates its own biogenesis by a lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism that involves TFEB and mTOR These data uncover a regulatory network linking an oncogenic transcription factor that is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB, to mTORC1 and endocytosis. We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controlling activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression. In particular, active RRAGs interact with the transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of a gene network that promotes lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, in modulating lysosomal proteostasis in LSDs. Here we show that the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is induced by starvation through an autoregulatory feedback loop and exerts a global transcriptional control on lipid catabolism via Ppargc1α and Ppar1α. Transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, also negatively regulated HIF-1 activity. These data uncover a regulatory network linking an oncogenic transcription factor that is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB, to mTORC1 and endocytosis. We found that ceria nanoparticles promote activation of the transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function and autophagy, and induce upregulation of genes of the lysosome-autophagy system. The transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes.  In particular, active RRAGs interact with the transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of a gene network that promotes lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy.  We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes.  In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controlling activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression.  We recently discovered the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) gene network and its master gene transcription factor EB (TFEB), which regulates lysosomal biogenesis and function.  Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the only known transcription factor that is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis although its role in macrophages has not been studied.  In contrast to its classical function as the waste management machinery, lysosomes are now considered to be an integral part of various cellular signaling processes. The diverse functionality of this single organelle requires a very complex and coordinated regulation of its activity with transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, at its core. Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controlling activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression. We observed that the MiT family of transcription factors, which includes the melanoma oncogene MITF (micropthalmia-associated transcription factor) and the lysosomal master regulator TFEB, had the highest phylogenetic conservation of three consecutive putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in animal proteomes. Transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, also negatively regulated HIF-1 activity. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and function, in modulating lysosomal proteostasis in LSDs.

We evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on fine-needle aspirates for categorization of small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs). A total of 51 cases, including 25 Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 11 rhabdomyosarcomas, 13 neuroblastomas, and 2 desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCTs) were analyzed. The detection of the EWS-FLI1 (20/25) and EWS-ERG (4/25) fusion transcripts resolved 24 of 25 cases of Ewing sarcoma/PNET Molecular detection of EWS-FLI1 chimeric transcripts in Ewing family tumors by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction To assess the feasibility and reliability of the molecular detection of the transcript originating from the chimeric gene in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, we performed a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay to detect the EWS-FLI1 chimeric message in a series of Ewing family tumors. Of 24 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 23 cases analyzed, the chimeric message was detectable in 20 (83%) specimens from 20 cases (87%) by this nested RT-PCR assay, whereas none of 7 small round cell tumors not from this family (3 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 neuroblastomas, 2 malignant lymphomas) showed detectable chimeric messages Using our different sets of exon specific primer pairs, it was possible to detect 4 different breakpoints of ews/fli1 fusion transcripts and the ews/erg fusion by RT-PCR in RNA isolates from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Ewing's tumor tissue. Molecular detection of EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material by nested RT-PCR is feasible and is useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ES/pPNETs. We established a novel RT-PCR method, using 3 different exon specific sets of PCR primer pairs, selected according to the coding ews and fli1 nucleotide sequences (NCBI database), suitable for RT-PCR identification of variant ews/fli1 fusion transcripts in RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In this study, we evaluated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain (RT-PCR) for EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts in 18 neurally derived small round cell tumours. We performed a clinical and pathologic analysis of 112 patients with ES in which EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Molecular detection of EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material by nested RT-PCR is feasible and is useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ES/pPNETs. RT-PCR confirmed that SK-NEP-1 expresses EWS-FLI1 gene fusion transcripts characteristic of Ewing sarcoma, and DNA sequencing demonstrated the joining of exon 7 of EWS with exon 5 of FLI1 for these transcripts. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts The aims of this study were (1) to present the diverse clinicopathological and molecular profile of EFTs in our settings, (2) to identify a pragmatic approach for diagnosing EFTs, especially for application of ancillary techniques, namely RT-PCR for specific transcripts (EWS-FLI1, EWS-ERG) and FISH for EWSR1 gene rearrangement, in certain cases and (3) to show the utility of tissue microarray in establishing a new FISH test [Detection of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript in Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors by one-step RT-PCR using paraffin-embedded tissues].

56c868a95795f9a73e000017	What is the application of the Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assay in Drosophila embryos?	Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms. This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant developing context. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC partnership as an illustrative test case. This protocol applies to any transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general. The understanding of developmental complexity will, therefore, require the characterization of protein interactions within their proper environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technology offers this possibility as it enables the direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo. Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters. Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions. We next used BiFC in a candidate interaction screen, which led to the identification of several Hox protein partners. Using fluorescent proteins, we previously developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and a multicolor BiFC assay to visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay represents one of these imaging tools for direct visualization of PPIs in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides an approach for the visualization of protein interactions and modifications in living cells. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides a direct approach for the visualization of molecular interactions in living cells and organisms. The purpose of this protocol is to calculate signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and to provide a semi-quantitative analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) in living cells. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells.

The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome with facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes and mental retardation as the main clinical features Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations Genetic heterogeneity in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: mutations in both the CBP and EP300 genes cause disease A certain level of CREB-binding protein is essential for normal development, since inactivation of one allele causes Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) In 92 patients, we were able to identify a total of 36 mutations in CBP We extended the search for mutations to the EP300 gene and showed that mutations in EP300 also cause this disorder. Mutations in the CREBBP (CREB-binding protein gene) cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Heterozygous CREBBP mutations were identified in 12 of the 21 patients: five frameshift mutations, three nonsense mutations, two splice-site mutations, and two missense mutations.

52f223e02059c6d71c00000e	Which is the genetic defect causing Neurofibromatosis type 1?	Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome are both common genetic disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) Identification of forty-five novel and twenty-three known NF1 mutations in Chinese patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), characterized by skin neurofibromas and an excess of café-au-lait spots, is due to mutations in the neurofibromin (NF1) gene. Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions. Fifty-eight were initially identified using heteroduplex analytical techniques and confirmed by sequence analysis. A further five were identified by direct sequence analysis alone. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Mis-sense, non-sense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations were identified across the entire gene of which the majority (45/68) were novel in nature. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 persons. It is an autosomal-dominant disorder with half of the cases resulting from spontaneous mutations. Characterization of the somatic mutational spectrum of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene in neurofibromatosis patients with benign and malignant tumors Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The region of DNA located between two translocation breakpoints has been cloned and a DNA sequence encoding a 11-13 kb mRNA identified. That this sequence shows deletions and point mutations in NF1 affected individuals and not in normal controls provides strong evidence that it is indeed the NF1 gene.	['Mutation in NF1 gene.']

5150b807d24251bc05000072	How many clinical trials for off-label drugs in neonates are cited in the literature.	Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis.	['none', '0', 'zero']
56c1d857ef6e394741000033	What enzyme is inhibied by Opicapone?	PURPOSE: Opicapone (OPC) is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to be used as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease.  Brain and peripheral pharmacokinetics of levodopa in the cynomolgus monkey following administration of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the systemic and central bioavailability of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (levodopa) and related metabolites in the cynomolgus monkey. CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone behaved as long-acting COMT inhibitor that markedly increased systemic and central levodopa bioavailability.  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel third generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to compare the levodopa pharmacokinetic profile throughout a day driven by the COMT inhibition either following repeated doses of opicapone or concomitant administration with entacapone. CONCLUSION: Opicapone, a novel third generation COMT inhibitor, when compared to entacapone, provides a superior response upon the bioavailability of levodopa associated to more pronounced, long-lasting, and sustained COMT inhibition.  Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of opicapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, in healthy subjects: prediction of slow enzyme-inhibitor complex dissociation of a short-living and very long-acting inhibitor. Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Opicapone is a novel third generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers.  AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and inhibitory effect on erythrocyte soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) activity following repeated doses of opicapone.  CONCLUSION: Despite its short elimination half-life, opicapone markedly and sustainably inhibited erythrocyte S-COMT activity making it suitable for a once daily regimen. Opicapone demonstrated marked and sustained inhibition of erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. The long duration of COMT inhibition by opicapone, however, tended to be independent from the dose taken.

56c5fd325795f9a73e000005	Which is the genetic basis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?	Mutations in TRPV4, encoding a cation channel, have recently been identified in one large dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy kindred, but the genetic basis of dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy in many families remains unknown. We report clinical, electrophysiology, muscle magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology findings in a four generation family with typical dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy features, without mutations in TRPV4, and in whom linkage to other known dominant neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy genes has been excluded. The autopsy findings in the proband, who died at 14 months of age from an unrelated illness, provided a rare opportunity to study the neuropathological basis of dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy. There was a redu Recently, the common forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have been associated with mutations of the SMN and NAIP genes on chromosome 5, in the region q11.2-13.3. Some correlation has been established between SMN protein levels and disease course; nevertheless, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic variability remains unclear, and it has been postulated that the loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of type I SMA Using comparative genomics to screen for such a factor among evolutionarily conserved sequences between mouse and human, we have identified a novel transcript, H4F5, which lies closer to SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region. A multi-copy microsatellite marker that is deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes is embedded in an intron of this gene, indicating that H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA. A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy A critical question is why only the homozygous loss of SMN1, and not SMN2, results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Thus, the failure of SMN2 to fully compensate for SMN1 and protect from SMA is due to a nucleotide exchange (C/T) that attenuates activity of an exonic enhancer. Autosomal recessive childhood proximal SMA is the commonest form and is due to mutations in a gene encoding a novel protein, SMN, that appears to play a critical role in RNA metabolism but has also been shown to interact with actin-binding proteins and mediators of programmed cell death. Mutations of the SMN1 gene are responsible for SMA. All patients were found to be homozygous for the loss of either exon 7 or exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene Six additional patients had anterior horn cell disease but were negative for the SMN1 gene deletion. All six had exclusion features listed in the international guidelines. The molecular genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, is the loss of function of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1) The structures of the SMN1 gene and SMN2 pseudogene, mutations distorting the SMN1 function, the structure and functions of the Smn neurotrophic protein, its role in biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and the principles and prdblems of molecular diagnosis in SMA are described. SMA are caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN1) leading to a reduction of the SMN protein amount. From a better knowledge of the genetic basis of SMA and the defects resulting from the mutations of SMN1 in cellular or animal models, several therapeutics strategies have been selected aiming at targeting SMN2, a partially functional copy of SMN1 gene which remains present in patients, or to prevent neurons from death. We used a homozygosity mapping and positional cloning approach in a consanguineous family of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and identified a nonsense mutation in the vaccinia-related kinase 1 gene (VRK1) as a cause of SMA-PCH SMN1 and SMN2 quantification was undertaken to investigate the genotype-phenotype relationship.RESULTS: Two novel point mutations were identified in exon 3 of SMN1 (p.Tyr130Cys and p.Tyr130His) in the highly conserved Tudor domain of the Smn protein.CONCLUSIONS: The genetic basis of SMA in the rare cases of compound heterozygous carriers of SMN1 deletions is complex.

5319ac99b166e2b806000034	Which is the third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1?	The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.	['TBC1D7']
54f89e1a06d9727f76000001	Which kinase is inhibited by the small molecule KN-93?	KN-93, a membrane-permeant calcium/calmodulin- dependent kinase-selective inhibitor, induces apoptosis in some lines of human tumor cells. Knockdown of βCaMKII by lentiviral-mediated expression of shRNA prevented the synaptic inactivity-induced increase in GluA1, as did treatment with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analog KN-92. To investigate the effects of KN-93, a CaMKII selective inhibitor on cell proliferation and the expression of p53 or p21 protein in human hepatic stellate cells.  Injection of the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 into pupae resulted in a reduced number of antennal lobe glial cells migrating into the neuropil to form borders around glomeruli. In contrast, addition of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitor KN93 blocked reporter gene activation in response to IH. These increases in CPEB phosphorylation were attenuated by a specific peptide inhibitor of CaMKII and by the general CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93. Alternatively, treatment with KN-93, a selective inhibitor of CaMKII activation, or adenoviral overexpression of kinase-negative CaMKII-delta(2), inhibited ATP-dependent activation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on PDBu- or PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2. Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KN-93 also blocked zygote elongation, while its ineffective analog KN-92 did not have such effect. CaM kinase inhibitor KN93 on its own exhibits little toxicity up to 10 mM, as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium. To further elucidate the mechanism by which calcium-induced ERK activation occurs, we used the CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93 and an inactive analog of KN-93 (KN-92). Hearts were pretreated with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 or the inactive analog KN-92 (0.5 microM) for 10 min before clofilium exposure. The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) inhibitor KN-93 has been shown to reversibly arrest mouse and human cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide.  A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) inhibitor, KN-93 potently inhibits gastric acid secretion from parietal cells.

51739df58ed59a060a00001c	Which is the most important prognosis sub-classification in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia?	One of the most reliable prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, which defines 2 subsets, mutated CLL (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), with different clinical courses. Mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHVs) of CLL cells offers useful prognostic information for high-risk patients but time and economical costs originally prevented it from being routinely used in a clinical setting. Instead, alternative markers of IGHV status, such as zeta-associated protein (ZAP70) or messenger RNA levels are often used Patients with unmutated IgV(H) gene show a shorter progression-free and overall survival than patients with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgV(H)) gene mutated	['The mutational status of the IGHV genes.']

55475dc2f35db75526000001	Which is the most known bacterium responsible for botulism (sausage-poisoning)?	Botulism is a serious foodborne neuroparalytic disease, caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Cattle botulism is a fatal intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D Botulism in horses in the USA is attributed to Clostridium botulinum types A, B or C. Clostridium botulinum is the etiological agent of botulism. Due to food-borne poisoning and the potential use of the extremely toxic botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) from C. botulinum Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is one of the most dangerous toxin in the world. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease that can occur in all warm-blooded animals, birds, and fishes. The disease in animals is mainly caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum strains belonging to group III, although outbreaks due to toxins produced by group I and II organisms have been recognized. Botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, all warm-blooded animals, and some fishes. The disease is caused by exposure to toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by different strains of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum are responsible for the disease botulism and include a group of immunologically distinct serotypes (A, B, E, and F) that are considered to be the most lethal natural proteins known for humans. Botulinumtoxin (BTX) is a neurotoxin produced from Clostridium botulinum under anaerobic conditions and is responsible for botulism, a notifiable, bacterial form of food poisoning. Botulism is a disease characterized by neuromuscular paralysis and is produced from botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) found within the Gram positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum. An epidemiological investigation and laboratory detection studies showed that sausage contaminated by type A Clostridium botulinum caused this outbreak of food poisoning. Botulism is caused by botulinum neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.

52fe52702059c6d71c000078	Where is the histone variant CENPA preferentially localized?	centromere protein A (CENPA), Centromere activity of the alphoid YAC was suppressed at ectopic locations on the host chromosome, as indicated by the absent or reduced assembly of CENP-A and -C. Heterozygous and homozygous Cenpa-GFP fusion-protein mouse mutants, generated through targeted insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into the mouse Cenpa gene locus, show specific localized fluorescence at all the centromeres. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates interaction between PARP-2 and its functional homolog PARP-1, constitutive centromere proteins Cenpa and Cenpb, and spindle checkpoint protein Bub3, but not with a third constitutive centromere protein Cenpc. Here we investigated the interaction of this protein with, and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of, three constitutive centromere proteins, Cenpa, Cenpb, and Cenpc, and a spindle checkpoint protein, Bub3 The evidence is consistent with the proposal of a critical epigenetic function for CENP-A in marking a chromosomal region for centromere formation CENPA is a member of the histone H3-like proteins and is thought to replace histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. CENPC is a DNA-binding protein that is located at the inner kinetochore plate of active mammalian centromeres.

5339ecf4d6d3ac6a3400005f	Which is the prognostic meaning of delayed enhancement documented in patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	 It is possible to conclude that there is a high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with high-risk or recovered from cardiac sudden death, like those with clinical indication to implantable cardioverter -defibrillator.  AF in HCM is related with myocardial fibrosis detected by DE-CMR and dilatation of the LA.  Over the follow-up period, the annualized adverse cardiovascular event rate in patients with DE exceeded that in patients without DE but did not achieve statistical significance (5.5% versus 3.3%; P=0.5).  Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients. There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, heart failure death, and all-cause mortality in HCM. Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance.  The hyperenhanced apical myocardium had a lower percentage of systolic myocardial thickening, and was associated with serious symptoms (e.g. syncope) and ventricular arrhythmias.  A semi-quantitative index of DCE is a significant multivariable predictor of both clinical VT/VF and of risk for SCD and may contribute to risk assessment in borderline or controversial cases. Myocardial scar imaged by CE-CMR is common in patients with HCM, and is predictive of VT.

5717d64f29809bbe7a000001	Which is the cellular localization of the protein Opa1?	. The subcellular distribution of mOPA1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells largely overlapped that of endogenous cytochrome c, a well known mitochondrial marker, elease of high MW Opa-1 isoforms from the mitochondria to the cytosol  mitochondrial fusion (opa-1) mitochondrial fusion genes Mfn1 (mitofusin 1), Mfn2 (mitofusin 2), Opa1 (optic atrophy 1)  Biochemical examinations indicate that both of the OPA1 isoforms are present in the intermembrane space. Submitochondrial fractionation by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation shows that the 88-kDa protein predominantly associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane, on the contrary, the 93-kDa protein associates with the inner membrane.  We describe here a nuclear gene, OPA1, that maps within the candidate region and encodes a dynamin-related protein localized to mitochondria.  The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria. Regulation of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Opa1 by proteolytic cleavage. Differential sublocalization of the dynamin-related protein OPA1 isoforms in mitochondria. The human dynamin-related protein OPA1 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the inter-membrane space. In addition to the capacity of these proteins to promote fusion, mitofusin 2 or OPA1 regulate mitochondrial metabolism and loss-of-function reduces oxygen consumption and the capacity to oxidize substrates. Here, we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations. Our experiments restrict the function of prohibitins to mitochondria and identify the processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, an essential component of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, as the central cellular process controlled by prohibitins. LRRK2 partially co-localizes with endosomal dynamin-1 or with mitofusins and OPA1 at mitochondrial membranes. While initial fusion of mitochondria by 15d-PGJ2 required the presence of both outer (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and inner (OPA1) mitochondrial membrane fusion proteins, later mitochondrial changes involved increased degradation of the fusion protein OPA1 and ubiquitination of newly synthesized OPA1 along with decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2, which likely contributed to the loss of tubular rigidity, disorganization of cristae, and formation of large swollen degenerated dysfunctional mitochondria. Assay and properties of the mitochondrial dynamin related protein Opa1. Mitochondrial remodeling following fission inhibition by 15d-PGJ2 involves molecular changes in mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1. We have previously described that silencing of the mitochondrial protein OPA1 enhances mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling and aldosterone production in H295R adrenocortical cells. Our results define, for the first time, a function of the middle domain of the Opa1 protein and demonstrate that mitochondrial retention of Opa1 protein is essential for normal embryogenesis. Here, we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations Differential sublocalization of the dynamin-related protein OPA1 isoforms in mitochondria The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria.  Mitochondrial fission and fusion mediators, hFis1 and OPA1, modulate cellular senescence. The dynamin-related GTPase protein OPA1, localized in the intermembrane space and tethered to the inner membrane of mitochondria, participates in the fusion of these organelles.  Lack of mitochondrial retention of Opa1 is sufficient to cause the cellular Opa1 loss-of-function phenotype as the mitochondria are fragmented, indicating an inability to fuse.  Opa1, also known as Mgm1 in yeast, is a mitochondrial member of the dynamin family. Unlike other dynamin family members, Opa1 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that this protein is imported into mitochondria. Here, we describe biochemical techniques, such as mitochondrial isolation, digitonin extraction, a protease protection assay, and carbonate extraction, that were used to determine that mammalian Opa1 resides in the intermembrane space where it is tightly bound to the inner membrane. The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, The dynamin-related GTPase protein OPA1, localized in the intermembrane space and tethered to the inner membrane of mitochondria, participates in the fusion of these organelles. we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations. PKA phosphorylates perilipin, a protein localized on the surface of lipid droplets that serves as a gatekeeper to regulate access of lipases converting stored triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here, we report a new function for optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), a protein known to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, as a dual-specificity A-kinase anchoring protein associated with lipid droplets. We find that Mgm1/OPA1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space,	['mitochondrial intermembrane space']
552421082c8b63434a000005	What is the enzymatic activity of the breast cancer associated gene BRCA1?	E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known enzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger domain. BRCA1 nuclear transport and ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymatic activity are tightly regulated by the BRCA1 dimeric binding partner BARD1 and further modulated by cancer mutations and diverse signaling pathways. E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is not essential for mammalian cell viability or homology-directed repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the related BARD1 protein to form a heterodimeric complex that acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Because the enzymatic activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is conserved over a broad phylogenetic range, it is thought to be critical for the central functions of BRCA1. A mechanism for transcriptional repression dependent on the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, we identified an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism by which BRCA1 inhibits transcription. BRCA1 ubiquitinates the transcriptional preinitiation complex, preventing stable association of TFIIE and TFIIH, and thus blocks the initiation of mRNA synthesis.  In the structure the arrangement of the Ring-domains is similar to another H2A E3 ligase, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, but complex formation depends on an N-terminal arm of Ring1b that embraces the Bmi1 Ring-domain. Discovering the precise function of the breast and ovarian specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has proven to be quite complicated. It has been determined that BRCA1, together with BARD1, comprise an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Since it is now known that BRCA1 is an enzyme, the challenge for BRCA1 research is to learn how this enzymatic activity functions in normal breast and ovarian cells in order to suppress cancerous transformation. The BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene is expressed in all mammalian cells. Within these cells, the BRCA1 protein product interacts with several seemingly distinct nuclear complexes. Proteins within these complexes are potential targets for the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity associated with BRCA1:BARD1 complexes.  During both DNA replication and DNA repair, BRCA1 appears to serve both adaptor and enzymatic functions. Roles include transient physical recruitment of NBS1, gammaH2AX, FANCD2 and other proteins in specific repair associated complexes, and enzymatic activity as an E3-ubiquitin ligase against a subset of these proteins.  The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression.	['E3 ubiquitin ligase activity']

54ede28094afd61504000003	What is the disease in which patients are sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents, presenting with a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations?	Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal disorder that causes genome instability. FA patients suffer developmental abnormalities, early-onset bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to cancer. The disease is manifested by defects in DNA repair, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and a high degree of chromosomal aberrations. Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized at the cellular level by a high frequency of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations; crosslinking agents cause an abnormal increase in the frequency of chromosomal damage, and semiconservative DNA synthesis is severely inhibited. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Cells from patients wtih Fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents which are capable of crosslinking DNA. An elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to DNA crosslinking agents, is a general feature of Fanconi's anemia. FA patients exhibit spontaneous chromosome breakage and FA cells are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslink agents and expresses high frequency of chromosome breakage Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized at the cellular level by a high frequency of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations; crosslinking agents cause an abnormal increase in the frequency of chromosomal damage, and semiconservative DNA synthesis is severely inhibited Cells from patients wtih Fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents which are capable of crosslinking DNA At the cellular level, FA is characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and by high frequencies of induced chromosomal aberrations, a property used for diagnosis An elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to DNA crosslinking agents, is a general feature of Fanconi's anemia Similarly, Fanconi's anemia cells, which are chromosomally sensitive to crosslinking agents, and appear to be defective in the "unhooking" of linked polynucleotide strands [15, 16, 49, 51], are reported to be chromosomally sensitive to ethyl methanesulfonate as well [29], and to be sensitive to ionizing radiation [7, 19, ]0], again implying overlapping repair systems	['Fanconi anemia']

During the past year, two SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Currently dapagliflozin, one of the three most advanced SGLT2 inhibitors in the development (along with canagliflozin and empagliflozin), is already in the market in few European countries and canagliflozin has been approved from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in US. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition with canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This report reviews the potentially beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically focusing on canagliflozin, the only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in the United States. The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin lowered blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight, with increased risk of urogenital infections in Phase 2 studies.  Canagliflozin (Invokana™), an oral selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is under global development with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

5545186cbf90a13052000002	Which gene strand is targeted by transcription-coupled repair (TCR)?	Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is the major pathway involved in the removal of UV-induced photolesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. transcription-coupled repair (TCR) provides faster repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. there are two sub-pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the global genome (gg) NER and the transcription-coupled repair (TCR). TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. transcription-coupled repair (TCR) since targets for DNA damage are situated on the transcribed or coding strand of DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), which removes a variety of helix-distorting lesions from DNA, is initiated by two distinct DNA damage-sensing mechanisms. Transcription Coupled Repair (TCR) removes damage from the active strand of transcribed genes Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that allows for the enhanced repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. Transcription coupled repair (TCR) is a nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway that is dedicated to repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a pathway dedicated to the removal of damage from the template strands of actively transcribed genes. Although the detailed mechanism of TCR is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating RNA polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA. Among these is a process called transcription-coupled repair (TCR) that catalyzes the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes, often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart. These results suggest that UV treatment results in an induced repair of UV-damaged DNA in the transcribed strand of an active gene in XP-C and normal cells through an enhancement of TCR or a mechanism which involves the TCR pathway. TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a universal sub-pathway of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system that is limited to the transcribed strand of active structural genes. NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes. Transcription coupled repair (TCR), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) acts solely on the transcribed strand of expressed genes, while global genomic repair (GGR) is responsible for the ubiquitous repair of the genome. In addition to the recognition and excision of DNA damage throughout the genome (GGR), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR), for recognizing some types of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of genes in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes. TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that acts specifically on lesions in the transcribed strand of expressed genes. The blockage of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) at a DNA damage site on the transcribed strand triggers a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), which rapidly removes DNA damage on the transcribed strand of the expressed gene and allows the resumption of transcription. It has been previously shown that disruption of RAD26 in yeast strain W303-1B results in a strain that is deficient in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the preferential repair of the transcribed strand of an expressed gene over the non-transcribed strand and the rest of the genome. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes A dedicated excision repair pathway, termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), targets the removal of DNA lesions from transcribed strands of expressed genes NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes Transcription coupled repair (TCR) is a nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway that is dedicated to repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is generally observed as more rapid or more efficient removal of certain types of DNA damage from the transcribed strands of expressed genes compared with the nontranscribed strands In addition to the recognition and excision of DNA damage throughout the genome (GGR), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR), for recognizing some types of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of genes in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells	['the transcribed strand']

56ed14d92ac5ed145900000a	What is the genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis?	The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors Ten years ago, a mutation in the TSC2 gene was identified in the Eker rat at Fox Chase Cancer Center by Yeung and Knudson, and in Tokyo by Kobayashi and Hino. Here, we will review the clinical association of RCC in TSC, consider the factors that have led to its under-emphasis within the RCC field, address the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to RCC in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and finally discuss the ways in which the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to sporadic RCC in the general population. Either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, can be mutated, resulting in the tuberous sclerosis complex phenotype. The protein products of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), have been discovered to play important roles in several cell-signaling pathways Knowledge regarding the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex has led to therapeutic intervention trials.  TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease. We previously found TSC2 loss of heterozygosity in 7 of 13 (54%) of angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients, suggesting that LAM and TSC could have a common genetic basis. Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex gene TSC2 are a cause of sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis The disease can be caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC2, identified in 1993, and TSC1, only recently identified. Molecular genetic basis of renal carcinogenesis in the Eker rat model of tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2) We have recently identified on rat chromosome 10q a germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis gene (Tsc2), the gene predisposing to renal carcinoma (RC) in the Eker rat Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene that can result in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organ systems Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway.  In all these lesions, genetic alterations related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have been demonstrated.

57092332cf1c325851000018	What is the molecular function of the Chd1 protein?	The DNA-binding domain of the Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzyme contains SANT and SLIDE domains The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzyme Chd1 is a 168-kDa protein consisting of a double chromodomain, Snf2-related ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The presence of these domains in ISWI and Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzymes may provide a means of efficiently harnessing the action of the Snf2-related ATPase domain for the purpose of nucleosome spacing and provide an explanation for partial redundancy between these proteins. Here we identify the chromatin remodelling protein Chd1 (chromo-ATPase/helicase-DNA binding domain 1) as a component of SAGA and SLIK one of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity Human but not yeast CHD1 binds directly and selectively to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 via its tandem chromodomains In the current study, we identify human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4 human CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein. We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not.  Analysis of nucleosome repositioning by yeast ISWI and Chd1 chromatin remodeling complexes. However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end, whereas Isw1b can. The ISWI and CHD1 chromatin remodelling activities influence ADH2 expression and chromatin organization Here we show that the absence of the Isw1 and Chd1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activities delays the maximal expression of ADH2 without impairing the chromatin remodelling that occurs upon activation. Thus, the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling, but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome. the lack of Chd1 combined with the absence of Isw1 and Isw2 impairs nucleosome spacing along the ADH2 gene, and genome-wide in S. cerevisiae Through inclusion of Chd1 sequences in homology searches SLIDE domains were identified in CHD6-9 proteins.  The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster.  Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9. Histone H3K4 and K36 methylation, Chd1 and Rpd3S oppose the functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4-Spt5 in transcription. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.

Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, containing two tandem chromodomains. Over-expression of an ATPase inactive form of CHD1 did not result in severe chromosomal defects, suggesting that the ATPase activity is required for this in vivo phenotype. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.

54f9cb34dd3fc62544000002	Which protein has been found to interact with phospholamban (PLN) and is also an anti-apoptotic protein?	To identify additional proteins that may interact with PLN, we used the yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cDNA library. HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner. Analysis of the anti-apoptotic function of HAX-1 revealed that the presence of PLN enhanced the HAX-1 protective effects from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. These findings suggest a possible link between the Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the PLN/HAX-1 interaction. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms through which SERCA2a and PLN control cardiomyocyte function in health and disease. Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores. Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function. The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death. Here we identify HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade.  Furthermore, the effects of PLN and its phosphorylation on cardiac function are subject to additional regulation by its interacting partners, the anti-apoptotic HAX-1 protein and Gm or the anchoring unit of protein phosphatase 1.  Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. Furthermore, the effects of PLN and its phosphorylation on cardiac function are subject to additional regulation by its interacting partners, the anti-apoptotic HAX-1 protein and Gm or the anchoring unit of protein phosphatase 1	['The HS-1 associated protein X-1', '(HAX-1)']

55058af6f73303d458000004	Which protein is the E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets the tumor suppressor p53 for proteasomal degradation?	p53 levels and activity are controlled in large part through regulated ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the 26S proteasome. Monoubiquitination of p53 is mediated primarily by the RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and impacts p53 activity through modulation of p53 localization and transcription activities.  The RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is the master regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. It targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, restraining the potent activity of p53 and enabling cell survival and proliferation. The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor is regulated primarily by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 to target it for proteasomal degradation. Aside from its ubiquitin ligase function, Mdm2 has been believed to be capable of suppressing p53's transcriptional activity by binding with and masking the transactivation domain of p53. The regulation of p53 expression levels is critical in controlling p53 activity in normal and damaged cells. This is well illustrated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation under normal conditions and is essential for controlling p53 activity during development. p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. Mdm2 has been thought to regulate the tumor suppressor p53 in two ways: by masking p53's access to transcriptional machinery, and by ubiquitinating p53, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This dogma was recently challenged by data generated from knockin mice in which Mdm2's RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was abrogated by a single point mutation. The RING mutant Mdm2 is fully capable of binding with p53, yet cannot suppress p53 activity, suggesting that Mdm2 cannot block p53 by binding alone, without ubiquitination. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the proteasomal degradation and activity of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma and the transcription factor E2F1.  The p53 tumor suppressor protein has a major role in protecting genome integrity. Under normal circumstances Mdmx and Mdm2 control the activity of p53. Both proteins inhibit the transcriptional regulation by p53, while Mdm2 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target both p53 and Mdmx for proteasomal degradation.  p53 is a critical coordinator of a wide range of stress responses. To facilitate a rapid response to stress, p53 is produced constitutively but is negatively regulated by MDM2. MDM2 can inhibit p53 in multiple independent ways: by binding to its transcription activation domain, inhibiting p53 acetylation, promoting nuclear export, and probably most importantly by promoting proteasomal degradation of p53. The latter is achieved via MDM2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity harbored within the MDM2 RING finger domain. Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Acetylation of p53 regulates p53's transcriptional activity and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. Recent studies have shown, however, that the ring-finger domain (RFD) of MDM2, where the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity resides, is necessary but not sufficient for p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that an additional activity of MDM2 might be required. The Mdm2 proto-oncogene is amplified and over-expressed in a variety of tumors. One of the major functions of Mdm2 described to date is its ability to modulate the levels and activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 binds to the N-terminus of p53 and, through its action as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets p53 for rapid proteasomal degradation.  The HDM2-p53 loop is crucial for monitoring p53 level and human pathologies. Therefore, identification of novel molecules involved in this regulatory loop is necessary for understanding the dynamic regulation of p53 and treatment of human diseases. Here, we characterized that the ribosomal protein L6 binds to and suppresses the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2, and subsequently attenuates HDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation.  Together, our study identifies the crucial function of RPL6 in regulating HDM2-p53 pathway, which highlights the importance of RPL6 in human genetic diseases and cancers. Targeting the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 can lead to a therapeutic surge in p53 levels. However, the efficacy of HDM2 inhibition can be compromised by overexpression of HDMX, an HDM2 homolog that binds and sequesters p53. The p53 tumour suppressor protein is tightly controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), but maintains MDM2 expression as part of a negative feedback loop.  Murine double minute (MDM2) is an E3 ligase that promotes ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53). This is well illustrated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation under normal conditions and is essential for controlling p53 activity during development. Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the proteasomal degradation and activity of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma and the transcription factor E2F1 The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor is regulated primarily by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 to target it for proteasomal degradation	['The mouse double minute 2 (mdm2)', 'The human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2)']

55032e65e9bde69634000034	What is the characteristic feature of the Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome.	Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a rare condition characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, calvarial thickening, skull and facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiparesis, cognitive impairment and seizures. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome refers to atrophy of one cerebral hemisphere (hemiatrophy) due to an insult to the brain in fetal or early childhood period.  Acquired cerebral hemiatrophy: Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome - a case report. CT and MRI scan of the head showed hemiatrophic cerebral parenchyma with prominent sulci and encephalomalacia. CT of the brain revealed characteristic features diagnostic of infantile type of cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed atrophic of left cerebral hemisphere with mildly ventricular dilatation, prominent paranasal and mastoid air cells, suggestive of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS). Imaging showed resolution of the infection and features of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (cerebral hemiatrophy).  Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare epilepsy syndrome that is characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, homolateral skull hyperplasia, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses, seizures with or without mental retardation, and contralateral hemiparesis.  Brain MRI showed prominent atrophy in the left frontal dorsal and lateral regions and mild atrophy of the left superior temporal gyrus and left parietal gyri. A 15-year-old female presented with seizures, right-sided hemiparesis, hemiatrophy of the right side of the body and mental retardation.  Described here is the case of a girl with a reticulated capillary malformation on the right side of her face, along with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, as evidenced by microphthalmia and severe associated anomalies in the right eye, and right cerebral hemispheric atrophy and cerebral arteries malformations. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the cognitive and electroclinical characteristics of right cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome [DDMS]).  The CHA of childhood or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, is originated by intrauterine or perinatal insults that affect the perfusion of a single cerebral hemisphere, manifesting clinically by variable mental retardation, refractory epilepsy, facial asymmetry, hemiplegia/hemiparesis or abnormal movements of the contralateral extremities and by imaging studies, loss of volume in one cerebral hemisphere and ipsilateral compensatory cranial changes such as skull vault thickening, elevation of the orbital roof and petreous ridge, also hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinus and mastoid cells. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a disorder involving hemiatrophy or hypoplasia of 1 cerebral hemisphere secondary to an insult in the developing brain. Often this will manifest with seizures, hemiparesis, mental retardation, and facial changes. Associated with this pathology are the radiologically evident changes, such as thickening of the calvarium, hyperpneumatization of the sinuses, and dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle among others. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, or cerebral hemiatrophy, is a pre- or perinatally acquired entity characterized by predominantly neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia, and mental retardation.  The Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is characterized by various symptoms related to hemiatrophy of the cerebrum and hypertrophy of the ipsilateral calvarium and paranasal sinuses. Clinical findings include hemiparesis or hemiplegia, seizures and/or mental retardation.  Asymmetry of cerebral hemispheric growth with atrophy on one side, ipsilateral osseous hypertrophy and hyper-pneumatization of sinuses with contralateral paresis are features of Dyke Davidoff Masson Syndrome (DDMS).

A 21-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presented with uncontrolled seizures. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis and mental retardation. Brain MRI showed unilateral loss of cerebral volume with hypertrophy and hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells.  Although radiological findings of cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome) are well known, there is no systematic study about the gender and the affected side in this syndrome. The patient was a 19-year-old woman who presented with hemiatrophy and diminished superficial sensation on the left side of her body including her face. She had a past history of tonic-clonic seizures accompanied by left hemiparesis in late childhood. Brain CT demonstrated dilatation of the frontal sinus, calvarial thickening, cerebral hemiatrophy and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on the right side. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the right cerebrum and midbrain and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on T1-weighted images, as well as a high signal intensity area from the parietal to the occipital lobe on T2-weighted images.  Cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis, and mental retardation.  The radiological features are unilateral loss of cerebral volume and associated compensatory bone alterations in the calvarium, like thickening, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells and elevation of the petrous ridge.  We reported a 39-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presenting with total hemiatrophy.  This paper presents an 18-year-old mentally retarded patient with cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome) associated with a growing skull fracture in the ipsilateral hemicranium, in whom not only a dural tear but also the ipsilaterally displaced and dilated lateral ventricle due to the original disease apparently contributed to the development of growing skull fracture.

Tafazzin is a mitochondrial phospholipid transacylase, and its mutations cause Barth syndrome (BTHS) Tafazzin, a mitochondrial acyltransferase, plays an important role in cardiolipin side chain remodeling. Previous studies have shown that dysfunction of tafazzin reduces cardiolipin content, impairs mitochondrial function, and causes dilated cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ) A zebrafish model of human Barth syndrome reveals the essential role of tafazzin in cardiac development and function. Barth syndrome: cellular compensation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis inhibition due to changes in cardiolipin remodeling linked to tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutation. This resynthesis of deacylated cardiolipin from monolysocardiolipin occurs via the Barth Syndrome gene product tafazzin and acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 and the alpha subunit of trifunctional protein. We conclude that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant prevents cardiac dysfunction induced by tafazzin gene knockdown in cardiac myocytes and suggest mito-Tempo as a potential therapeutic for Barth syndrome and other dilated cardiomyopathies resulting from mitochondrial oxidative stress.

52b2e498f828ad283c000010	Mutation of which gene is associated with Achondroplasia?	She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals who may be too young to diagnose with certainty or in individuals with atypical findings, molecular genetic testing can be used to detect a mutation in FGFR3. Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development. The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380. To investigate the mutation at the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) nucleotide 1138 site for identifying the major pathologic mechanism of achondroplasia (ACH) and to evaluate the efficacy of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) method for screening the point mutations.  Nucleotide 1138 in transmembrane domain of FGFR3 gene is the hot point for mutation in ACH and hence its major pathologic cause.  The nucleotide 1138 of FGFR3 gene is also the hotspot of mutation in Chinese patients with ACH. A simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method has been set up to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic dwarfism. The diagnosis of achondroplasia was based on the presence of clinical and radiographic findings and confirmed by the presence of a common FGFR3 gene mutation (Gly380Arg) detected by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.  The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of achondroplasia. To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of short-limb dwarfism. Recently, the gene mutation responsible for ACH has been identified in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The cause of ACH is a point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA, resulting in the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine.  Recent studies mapped the achondroplasia gene on chromosome region 4p16.3 and identified a common mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).

5147c088d24251bc05000026	Which type of lung cancer is the most strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome?	The autoantibodies implicated in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES), which are known to inhibit ICa and INa in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, also significantly inhibited INa in SCLC cells. These results indicate that (i) action potentials in human SCLC cells result from the regenerative increase in voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance; (ii) fundamental characteristics of SCLC Na+ channels are the same as the classical sodium channels found in a variety of excitable cells; and (iii) in some LES patients, SCLC Na+ channels are an additional target of the pathological IgG present in the patients' sera. Clinical features were those of LES and occurred insidiously in this 68-year old man: proximal weakness predominant in the lower limbs, generalized areflexia, dryness of the mouth and partial right eye palsy. Investigations disclosed a small cell lung cancer. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may be important to the secretion of ectopic hormones and the etiology and pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of the motor nerve terminal in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are produced. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a myasthenia-like syndrome of paraneoplastic origin which is often associated with anaplastic small-cell lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common cause of LES. We report an unusual case of LES associated with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. The Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels and often occurs in patients with small cell lung cancer. A 53 year-old heavy smoker presented with a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Bronchoscopy was normal but radiological examinations revealed a lymph node in site 4R. The pathological diagnosis after mediastinoscopy was negative. Twenty-five months later, an opacity on chest X-ray led to a biopsy which revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. LEMS is generally associated with small cell lung cancer occurring in three percent of cases. However, the case that we report shows the unusual association of LEMS with non small-cell lung cancer and highlights the difficulties associated in the management of this condition. LEMS has a high degree of coincidence (approximately 60%) with small cell lung cancer; the remaining 40% of patients with LEMS have no detectable tumor. BACKGROUND: To enhance the acknowledgement of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer. There were 10 cases of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer Treatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome Improving the recognition of Lambert-Eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. The Lambert Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung cancer in 50% of the cases unlike generalized myasthenia which apparently is never associated with small-cell lung cancer. Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome is presented in two cases with small cell lung cancer. Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder caused by an IgG-mediated reduction in number of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the neuromuscular junction. In at least 50% of cases, the stimulus for antibody production may be VGCC on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Also, there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with LES from those with LES and concurrent SCLC. The cancer associated with LEMS was small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in 15 cases and epidermoid lung carcinoma in 3 cases. Etiology of this disease is uncertain but in view of its frequent association with small cell lung cancer, this specific type of neoplasm may be implicated in the initiation of autoimmune response. Recent studies indeed support the possibility that the antigenic stimulus in the neoplastic form of LES may arise from voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels found in the lung cancer cells. In the majority of LEMS patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells. Radiological, bronchoscopic and histological investigations revealed small-cell lung cancer, and neurophysiological investigations confirmed a diagnosis of LEMS. Physicians need to be aware that patients may develop PCD and LEMS associated with anti-VGCC antibody caused by small cell lung cancer, and a mass survey should be conducted and careful examinations performed. Biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) indicating the importance of repeated chest CT in LEMS even when an existing autoimmune-like disease and negative CT may suggest an autoimmune origin. BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular symptoms in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop more rapidly than in LEMS patients without a SCLC. The detection of SOX1 antibodies in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) predicts the presence of small cell lung cancer and may be used to follow more closely those LEMS patients with no evidence of cancer at the initial workup. The presence of a particular symptom associated with LEMS did not predict the presence of SCLC, but in patients with rapidly progressive LEMS the possibility of underlying lung cancer should be of particular concern. We report a case of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with LEMS and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week. Using this protein, we demonstrated that anti-beta-subunit antibodies are present in the sera of 23% of LEMS patients and only, in low titer, in 2% of small cell lung cancer patients without LEMS. The gene encoding the beta 2 protein, first described as a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) antigen in humans, is found close to a region that undergoes chromosome rearrangements in small cell lung cancer, which occurs in association with LEMS. We then tested sera from 72 LEMS patients' 25 with proven small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 66 healthy or other neurological, SCLC or autoimmune disease controls in an immunoprecipitation assay using 125I-omega-CmTx-labelled (P/Q-type) VGCCs in human cerebellar extract. In the majority of patients LEMS is associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in particular may develop LEMS, and SCLC is very often detected in patients affected by LEMS. We present a 69-year-old woman who had preventive whole brain radiation after a diagnosis of paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome related to small cell lung cancer Five months after radiation therapy, she developed radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy manifested by ataxia. Among the symptoms of lung cancer LEMS can be seen, but it is very rare. A patient with the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) and small cell lung cancer developed respiratory failure several hours after verapamil was given.	['small-cell lung cancer']
5719f5c67de986d80d00000d	What distinguishes lantibiotics from antibiotics?	One potentially interesting class of antimicrobials are the modified bacteriocins termed lantibiotics, which are bacterially produced, posttranslationally modified, lanthionine/methyllanthionine-containing peptides. low levels of resistance have been reported for lantibiotics compared with commercial antibiotics Mechanisms that hinder the action of lantibiotics are often innate systems that react to the presence of any cationic peptides/proteins or ones which result from cell well damage, rather than being lantibiotic specific. Lantibiotics are biologically active peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria.  Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics that are posttranslationally modified to introduce (methyl)lanthionine bridges. Lantibiotics are defined as peptide antibiotics containing the unusual amino acids mesolanthionine, 3-methyllanthionine, dehydroalanine, and dehydrobutyrine. Lantibiotics are antibiotic peptides distinguished by the presence of the rare thioether amino acids lanthionine and/or methyllanthionine. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified, peptide antibiotics containing unusual amino acids such as dehydrated amino acids and lanthionine. Lantibiotics are peptide antibiotics, realizing their unique secondary structure by posttranslational modifications, the most important one being the formation of the characteristic amino acid lanthionine. Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics.  Lantibiotics, a group of lanthionine-containing peptides, display their antibiotic activity by combining different killing mechanisms within one molecule.  Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized as prepeptides, which are posttranslationally modified.	['Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified natural peptides containing lanthionine']

54e0e902ae9738404b000001	What family do mDia proteins belong in?	mDia proteins are members of the formin family of actin nucleating proteins that polymerize linear actin filaments. mDia1, a linear actin nucleator of the Formin family the mammalian Diaphanous members of the formin family of proteins (mDia) are two key players in the formation of filopodia and neurites. mDia proteins are mammalian homologues of Drosophila diaphanous and belong to the formin family proteins that catalyze actin nucleation and polymerization.   The mDia family of formins  interacts with the formin protein mDia1 (DIAPH1). Formin-family proteins, in the active state, form actin-based structures such as stress fibres. Their activation mechanisms, however, are largely unknown except that mDia and its closely related formins can be activated by direct binding of the small GTPase Rho or Cdc42. Mouse Diaphanous-related formins (mDias) are members of the formin protein family that nucleate actin polymerization and subsequently promote filamentous actin (F-actin) elongation by monomer addition to fast-growing barbed ends. Diaphanous related formins (DRFs) are part of the formin protein family that control morphogenesis, embryonic differentiation, cytokinesis, and cell polarity. Diaphanous related formins (DRFs) are cytoskeleton remodeling proteins that mediate specific upstream GTPase signals to regulate cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell polarity, and organelle motility.

52f89fc62059c6d71c000050	From which tissue was the NCI-H520 cell-line derived?	The nanostructures target the cells with high affinity and specificity via the specific interaction between the aptamer (a 45-base oligonucleotide) and the cell, and distinguish A549 cells from other types of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7 cells) and subtypes of lung cancer cells (NCI-H157, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H446 cells).  Functional studies in A549 bronchioalveolar carcinoma and NCI-H520 squamous cell carcinoma cells revealed that Msi1 was enriched in spheroid cultures of tumor cells and in the CD133+ cell population.  BHLHB3 gene overexpression inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells.  Cellular proliferation was inhibited in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and SK-MES-1 by CTGF overexpression. Human NCI-H520 cancer cells transfected with PDCD5 cDNA showed decreased colony-forming ability.  In 4 lung cancer cell strains, BNIP3L protein was not detected in A549, NCI-H460, NCI-H446, except for NCI-H520, in which the protein expression level was slightly lower than that in immortal bronchial epithelial cell strain HBE4-E6/E7. We show that CLN3 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in glioblastoma (U-373G and T98g), neuroblastoma (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), prostate (Du145, PC-3, and LNCaP), ovarian (SK-OV-3, SW626, and PA-1), breast (BT-20, BT-549, and BT-474), and colon (SW1116, SW480, and HCT 116) cancer cell lines but not in pancreatic (CAPAN and As-PC-1) or lung (A-549 and NCI-H520) cancer cell lines. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H520 and H460, which have no endogenous Cyr61, formed 60-90% fewer colonies after being transfected with a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector than cells transfected with the same amount of empty vector. Importantly, the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines expressed either liver-specific (non-neuronal) mRNA (cell line A549) or predominantly the neuronal (cell line NCI-H520) AADC message.  The antitumor effect of CGP41251 (4'-N-benzoyl staurosporine), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, was examined on two kinds of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (adenocarcinoma: A549 and squamous cell carcinoma: NCI-H520).

54f60ae05f206a0c06000008	What is the substrate of the microbial enzyme inulinase?	Inulinases mainly produced by the microorganism and it degrades inulin into fructose which is a digestible form.   Inulin or inulin-rich materials can be actively hydrolyzed by microbial inulinases to produce glucose and fructose syrups that can be used in bioprocesses.  The catalysts treated at these conditions in both fluids were then used for the production of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) using sucrose and inulin as substrates in aqueous and organic systems. This work is focused on the synthesis of the fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose and inulin, using free, immobilized and pre-treated immobilized inulinase Using inulinases from K. marxianus NRRL Y 7571, 11.89% of GF2 and 20.83% of GF3 were obtained, using inulin as substrate.  TLC analysis of end product revealed that inulinase hydrolyzed inulin exclusively into fructose.  One product was an endo-inulinase, and the other was a β-fructofuranosidase. Both enzymes worked together to effectively degrade inulin. The K (m) and V (max) values of the purified enzyme for inulin were 2.3 mg/mL and 4.8 mg/min, respectively. Fructans were extracted from Agave salmiana juice, characterized and subjected to hydrolysis process using a commercial inulinase preparation acting freely.  A comparatively lower Michaelis-Menten constant (2.15 mg/ml) and higher maximum initial velocity (115 µmol/min/mg of protein) for inulinase I on inulin demonstrated the exoinulinase's greater affinity for inulin substrate. Inulin was hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme, yielding d-fructose as the main product.  The inulinase acts on the beta-(2,1)-D-fructoside links in inulin releasing D-fructose.

57090c33cf1c325851000013	How many genes are imprinted in the human genome?	Among approximately 70 known imprinted genes are some causing disorders affecting growth, metabolism and cancer predisposition.  By applying dsPIG to the mRNA-Seq data, we predicted 94 imprinted genes in 20 cerebellum samples and 57 imprinted genes in 9 diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates.  Interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least 18 genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues. To date, however, fewer than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. Approximately 150 imprinted genes are known to date, in humans and mice but, though computational searches have tried to extract intrinsic characteristics of these genes to identify new ones, the existing list is probably far from being comprehensive.  In this study we analyzed the imprinting of 22 genes in human, mouse, and cattle and found that in only 11 was imprinting conserved across the three species. However, 62 unique clones in the library were characterized, all of which were methylated and GC-rich, with a GC content>50%. Of these, 43 clones also showed a CpG(obs)/CpG(exp)>0.6, of which 30 were studied in detail. These unique methylated CpG islands mapped to 23 chromosomal regions, and 12 were differentially methylated regions in uniparental tissues of germline origin, i.e., hydatidiform moles (paternal origin) and complete ovarian teratomas (maternal origin), even though many apparently were methylated in somatic tissues. Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted. To date, however, fewer than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. The Imprinted Gene Catalogue now has more than 200 genes listed, and estimates based on mouse models suggest many more may exist in humans.  Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted. With samples of mRNA from appropriate tissues and a collection of informative cSNPs, a genome-wide search using this methodology could expand the list of genes that undergo genomic imprinting in a tissue- or temporal-specific manner. We confirmed that PEG10 is paternally expressed, identified one gene (ZNF331) with multiple lines of data indicating it is imprinted, and predicted several additional imprinting candidate genes. Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted.

56ed27202ac5ed145900000c	In which cells are A-type lamins expressed?	Antibodies specific for mouse A/C lamins, human A/C lamins, or B lamins have been used to define the lamin complement as a function of time in culture and of cell type.  dramatic increase in lamin A/C-positive cells was observed in the first 3 days of culture with both accessory cells and macrophages expressing lamins A/C as soon as such cell types could be identified. Parallel in vivo experiments showed that treatment with thioglycollate caused the percentage of lamin A/C-positive peritoneal macrophages to increase from 5 to 80% between Days 0 and 6. Early embryonic cells and stem cells of mammals generally possess only lamin B while lamins A and C appear later during differentiation.  Northern analysis and immunoblotting demonstrated that lamin A/C mRNA and protein were not detectable in some human cell lines whereas lamin B1 was always present In the rat brain, lamin A and C are expressed in relatively equal amounts, while the expressions of lamin B1 and B2 vary depending on the cell type. Hemopoietic cells from blood and bone marrow of mammals usually do not express lamins A/C but only lamin B, and this feature distinguishes these cells from the vast majority of somatic cells of the adult animal, which reveal lamins A/C as well as lamin B These results demonstrated that EC cells devoid of lamins A and C nevertheless possessed the appropriate mechanisms for the localization and mitotic redistribution of exogenous lamins A and C. Spermatogonia and seminoma cells, which follow a differentiation pathway along the spermatogenic lineage and show characteristics of germ cells, do not express A-type lamins. While B-type lamins are expressed in almost all cell types, no A-type lamins are present in early vertebrate embryos or undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines. B-type lamins are present in almost all cell types, but A-type lamins are expressed predominantly in differentiated cells, suggesting a role in maintenance of the differentiated state. The expression of A-type lamins coincides with cell differentiation and as A-type lamins specifically interact with chromatin, a role in the regulation of differential gene expression has been suggested for A-type lamins. In the literature it is conveyed that only B-type lamins are required in these early stages of development and that A-type lamins are not present or required until differentiation of specific cell types associated with specialized tissue is initiated. B-type lamins are present in almost all cell types, but A-type lamins are expressed predominantly in differentiated cells, suggesting a role in maintenance of the differentiated state The nuclear lamina is a meshwork of intermediate filaments adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane that in mammalian cells is predominantly composed of three proteins: lamin A, lamin B, and lamin C. Because lamin A and C (A-type lamins) expression has been shown to be lacking in several types of undifferentiated or rapidly proliferating cells, we investigated lamin expression in the human liver in conditions with hepatocellular regeneration (cirrhosis of various etiologies and macroregenerative nodules) and in hepatocellular carcinomas of various grades of differentiation Our results identify the absence of A-type lamin expression as a novel marker for undifferentiated ES cells and further support a role for nuclear lamins in cell maintenance and differentiation In an attempt to provide an additional meaning to lamin-genome contacts, a recent study characterized the association of gene promoters with A-type lamins in progenitor and differentiated cells Previous studies have shown that lamin A/C is not expressed during mouse development before day 9, nor in undifferentiated mouse embryonic carcinoma cells.  Ectopic expression of an A-type lamin does not interfere with differentiation of lamin A-negative embryonal carcinoma cells. Intriguingly, expression of A-type lamins occurs concomitant with cell differentiation and embryonic development.  While B-type lamins are expressed in almost all cell types, no A-type lamins are present in early vertebrate embryos or undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines.

What is the name of the analogous process in prokaryotic organisms?	he CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system in bacteria and archaea that functions via a distinct self-non-self recognition mechanism that is partially analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex. Compelling evidence indicates that the CRISPR-Cas system protects prokaryotes from viruses and other potential genome invaders. RNA in defense: CRISPRs protect prokaryotes against mobile genetic elements. n this article, we discuss our current understanding of this fascinating adaptive and heritable defense system, and describe functional similarities and differences with RNAi in eukaryotes. Bacteria have developed several defense mechanisms against bacteriophages over evolutionary time, but the concept of prokaryotic RNA interference mediated defense mechanism against phages and other invading genetic elements has emerged only recently. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) together with closely associated genes (cas genes) constitute the CASS system that is believed to provide a RNAi-like defense mechanism against bacteriophages within the host bacterium. In many prokaryotes, noncoding RNAs that arise from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci are now thought to mediate defense against viruses and other molecular invaders by an RNAi-like pathway.

5173bdb38ed59a060a000020	How many TAp73 isoforms have been identified in humans?	A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. Transcription from two different promoters on the p73 gene results in generation of transcriptionally active TAp73 isoforms and dominant negative DeltaNp73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type. The role of various p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis has been controversial. However, as we have recently shown, the generation of TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mice reveals that TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp-73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p73 isoforms, TAp73(-/-) mice show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors. Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (deltaN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionaly active TAp73, as well as a dominant-negatively acting DeltaNp73 transcript isoforms. Since some mutant p53 proteins and ΔNp73 isoforms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentially act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. p73 is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms, both of which are implicated in tumor suppression and/or promotion. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. p73 possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter controlling the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 isoforms and the anti-apoptotic ΔΝp73 isoforms respectively. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of two N-terminal isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, in medulloblastoma cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, to lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. The p73 gene possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter, resulting in TAp73 and DeltaNup73 isoforms, respectively. Mice with a complete deficiency of p73 have severe neurological and immunological defects due to the absence of all TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. Moreover, we also found that subcellular location of p73 isoforms changes with the culture density increases. Moreover, ectopic expression of DeltaNp73alpha (but not other p73 isoforms) increased alphaB-crystallin mRNA levels in the absence of p53. Like wt p53, TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms transactivate target genes that activate apoptosis signaling pathways. The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. In contrast, antiapoptotic DeltaNp73 isoforms lack the TA domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. The isoforms TAp63 and TAp73 transactivate p53 target genes and induce apoptosis, whereas the isoforms DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73 lack transactivation and might have dominant-negative effects in p53 family members. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated in tumors. Consequently, different p73 isoforms can be degraded by calpains, i.e., both N-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and DeltaNp73) as well as the C-terminal isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Variants lacking the TA domain (DeltaN isoforms) are induced by TAp73 and by p53, and inhibit their transcriptional activity. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). Interestingly, expression of the Delta Np73 is strongly up-regulated by the TA isoforms and by p53, thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of TAp73 and more importantly of p53.

52efbfccc8da898910000018	At which kind of individuals is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?	sHT in older people should be not regarded as a unique condition, and moderately old patients (aged <70-75 y) could be considered clinically similar to the adult population, albeit with a higher optimal TSH target value. Conversely, the oldest old subjects should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. An appropriately powered randomized controlled trial of levothyroxine in SCH examining vascular outcomes is now warranted. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. Sustained normalization of thyroid function during l-T(4) replacement therapy significantly decreases baPWV in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with autoimmune chronic thyroiditis, suggesting the improvement of arterial stiffening and, consequently, possible prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest that L-T(4) replacement therapy may be especially beneficial in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with high baseline baPWV and pulse pressure. The beneficial effects of L-T(4) replacement therapy in decreasing arterial stiffening and thus preventing cardiovascular disease might be limited to this sub-population. Although a consensus is still lacking, the strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of levothyroxine replacement on markers of cardiovascular risk is the substantial demonstration that restoration of euthyroidism can lower both total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. Restoration of euthyroidism by levothyroxine (LT4) treatment may correct the lipid profile and cardiac abnormalities, especially in patients with an initially higher deviation from normality and higher serum TSH levels. Importantly, a strong association between SH and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, independent of the traditional risk factors, has been recently reported in a large cross-sectional survey (the Rotterdam Study). However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000012	Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?	We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.  Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0.05). Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients.  Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized.  Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%).  Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient.  Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron.  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain.  All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases.  Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease. Restless leg syndrome manifested by iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis. Diurnal effects on motor control are evident in the human disease of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), which is purported to be linked to brain iron deficiency as well as alterations in dopaminergic systems.  Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome.  Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy.

56d1da3b67f0cb3d66000006	How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates?	Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000d	Which hormone abnormalities are common in Williams syndrome ?	WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. The cortisol awakening response in WS was associated with parent-reported levels of somatic complaints and social difficulties. Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile that may be sensitive to social and activity transitions throughout the day. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior.  Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects.  Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized by cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended.  In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation.  Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.  None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism.  Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well.  Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). A WS patient with CPP is presented, whose pubertal development and bone age progression were arrested by administration of GnRH analogues.   This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy.  In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height. Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent.  Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS.  Thyroid hemiagenesis and elevated thyrotropin levels in a child with Williams syndrome. A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. However, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and thyroid dysgenesis have been found in other WS cases.  We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.  Although growth hormone deficiency is not likely to be a common cause of short stature in Williams-Beuren syndrome, we nevertheless recommend evaluation of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis in all cases. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.  Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels.  These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion. It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome.   These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion, compared with a group of seven normal children. Our studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome. Additional periodic evaluations during childhood: serum concentration of calcium, thyroid function, hearing, and renal and bladder ultrasound examination. Periodic evaluations during adulthood: glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, and arterial stenosis; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function.  Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%).	['thyroid']

552faababc4f83e828000005	Which translocation is the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma?	Tumours defined as Ewing sarcoma (ES) constitute a group of highly malignant neoplasms that most often affect children and young adults in the first 2 decades of life. The EWS/Fli-1 fusion gene, a product of the translocation t(11;22) (q24; 12), is detected in 95% of ES patients Ewing's sarcoma is a malignancy characterized by a specific 11:22 chromosomal translocation which generates a novel EWS-FLI1 fusion protein functioning as an aberrant transcription factor The hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a translocation--t(11;22)(q24;q12)--that most frequently results in the EWS/FLI1 aberrant chimeric gene The chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) yields the EWS-Fli1 fusion gene, which contributes to the development of Ewing Family Tumors (EFTs) Ewing sarcoma is extremely rare in people from East and Southeast Asia The t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series We confirmed that distant metastases is highly predictive of a poor outcome, and that the t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series The genetic hallmark of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumours (ESFT) is the presence of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, present in up to 85% of cases of ESFT, which creates the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene and results in the expression of a chimeric protein regulating many other genes. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor. The chromosomal translocation producing the EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript characterizes clinical Ewing sarcoma. Translocation of chromosomes 11 and 22 in choroidal metastatic Ewing sarcoma detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Molecular detection of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation in Ewing sarcoma is valuable in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors. This patient illustrates the second reported occurrence of primary Ewing sarcoma in the stomach and the first reported with the t(11;22)(q24;q12) gene translocation. Translocations involving ETS-transcription factors, most commonly leading to the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, are the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma. EWS-Fli1, a fusion gene resulting from a chromosomal translocation t(11;22, q24;q12) and found in Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, encodes a transcriptional activator and promotes cellular transformation. The presence of the t(11;22)(q24;ql2) translocation should probably not be considered diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the absence of supporting histological evidence. Ewing sarcoma is the prototypical member of this group of sarcomas; it was the first to be recognized pathologically as a singular entity and to have its signature translocation defined cytogenetically, which led to the identification of its key driver alteration, the EWS-FLI1 gene fusion that encodes this aberrant, chimeric transcription factor. The hallmark of Ewings sarcoma (EWS) is a translocation--t(11;22)(q24;q12)--that most frequently results in the EWS/FLI1 aberrant chimeric gene. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor. This patient illustrates the second reported occurrence of primary Ewing sarcoma in the stomach and the first reported with the t(11;22)(q24;q12) gene translocation. Diagnosis is based on history, immunostaining with at least 2 neural markers, ultrastructural examination, and evidence of an abnormal t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation as the hallmark for the Ewing's sarcoma family. The translocation results in the fusion of the EWS gene with the transcription factor gene FLI1 which has been considered a hallmark of ESFT. [Chromosomal translocation (11; 22) in cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma]. These results, associated with those obtained at the same time and independently from fresh tumor cells, suggest that the translocation t(11; 22)(q24; q12) may be a chromosomal marker characteristic of Ewing sarcoma cells. Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma Diagnosis is based on history, immunostaining with at least 2 neural markers, ultrastructural examination, and evidence of an abnormal t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation as the hallmark for the Ewing's sarcoma family Translocations involving ETS-transcription factors, most commonly leading to the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, are the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma The genetic hallmark of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumours (ESFT) is the presence of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, present in up to 85% of cases of ESFT, which creates the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene and results in the expression of a chimeric protein regulating many other genes The translocation results in the fusion of the EWS gene with the transcription factor gene FLI1 which has been considered a hallmark of ESFT	['translocation t(11;22) (q24;12)']

CRD-BP shields c-myc and MDR-1 RNA from endonucleolytic attack by a mammalian endoribonuclease The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) has high affinity for the coding region determinant (CRD) of c-myc mRNA. Such affinity is believed to protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack  These results provide the first direct evidence that CRD-BP can indeed protect c-myc CRD cleavage initiated by an endoribonuclease CRD-BP: a c-Myc mRNA stabilizing protein with an oncofetal pattern of expression The Coding Region Determinant-Binding Protein (CRD-BP) is an RRM and KH-domain-containing protein that recognizes specifically at least three RNAs. It binds to one of the two c-myc mRNA instability elements CRD-BP has been assigned a role in stabilizing c-myc mRNA by preventing its endonucleolytic cleavage A 249-nucleotide coding region instability determinant (CRD) destabilizes c-myc mRNA. Previous experiments identified a CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) that appears to protect the CRD from endonuclease cleavage These data suggest that c-myc mRNA is rapidly degraded unless it is (i) translated without pausing or (ii) protected by the CRD-BP when pausing occurs Here, we confirm that human CRD-BP/IMP-1 binds to c-myc mRNA The coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) binds in vitro to c-myc mRNA and is thought to stabilize the mRNA and increase c-Myc protein abundance Two regions within c- myc mRNA determine its short half-life. One is in the 3'-untranslated region, the other is in the coding region. A cytoplasmic protein, the coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP), binds in vitro to the c- myc coding region instability determinant. We have proposed that the CRD-BP, when bound to the mRNA, shields the mRNA from endonucleolytic attack and thereby prolongs the mRNA half-life Developmental regulation of CRD-BP, an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes c-myc mRNA in vitro We previously isolated and characterized a coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) that might regulate c-myc mRNA post-transcriptionally CRD-BP binds specifically to the coding region of c-myc mRNA and might stabilize c-myc mRNA in vitro by protecting it from endonucleolytic cleavage	['To protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack.']

Myotubularin phosphoinositide phosphatases: cellular functions and disease pathophysiology. Although myotubularin was thought to be a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, recent results indicate that it is primarily a lipid phosphatase, acting on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, and might be involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway and membrane trafficking. Myotubularin is the archetype of a family of highly conserved protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like enzymes.  we and others have characterized myotubularin as a potent and specific phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatase.  MTMR2 encodes a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide-3-phosphatases, which dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2.

BACKGROUND: Delamanid (OPC-67683), a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative, is a new antituberculosis medication that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and has shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial, we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health Organization guidelines.  This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Linezolid may represent a valuable drug to treat cases of XDR-TB. Delamanid, bedaquiline, and PA-824 are new anti-TB agents in the development pipeline that have the potential to enhance the cure rate of XDR-TB.	['tuberculosis']
56d3346cf22319765a000008	What is situs inversus?	Situs inversus totalis is a relatively rare condition and is an autosomal recessive congenital defect in which an abdominal and/or thoracic organ is positioned as a "mirror image" of the normal position in the sagittal plane. Situs inversus totalis (SIT) represents a total vertical transposition of the thoracic and abdominal organs which are arranged in a mirror image reversal of the normal positioning. The patient had dextrocardia situs inversus totalis with a mirror-image reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is characterized by complete mirroring of gross cardiac anatomy and position combined with an incompletely mirrored myofiber arrangement, being normal at the apex but inverted at the base of the left ventricle (LV). Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly with a complete mirror image of the thoracic and abdominal organs.   Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is an uncommon congenital syndrome, which refers to a reversal mirror-image of the normal thoracoabdominal organs position.

52b2e1d8f828ad283c00000c	What is the indication of Daonil (Glibenclamide)?	Metformin and glibenclamide are now increasingly viewed as a rational alternative to insulin therapy--a treatment both preferred by the women and a less expensive one, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The effect of TFG on blood glucose were studied and the levels of lipid peroxidation [MDA (Malondialdehyde)] and antioxidant enzymes [SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GPx (Reduced Glutathione peroxidase)] were estimated and compared with standard drugs glibenclamide and insulin. Treatment with TFG, insulin and glibenclamide resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose in LM (8.71%) and HM (3.87%) in comparison with normal controls. Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect. However, dietary supplementation with PB (6 g/kg extract for 4 weeks administered orally using an intragastric tube) ameliorated the alloxan-induced diabetes in a manner comparable with that of the reference antidiabetic drug glibenclamide Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). In mild NIDDM, gliclazide, tolbutamide or acetohexamide is used, and in more severe NIDDM glibenclamide is used. An improvement of the glucose tolerance could be observed up to 3 years, whereas after a 5-year glibenclamide therapy no certain influence on the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion could be proved. In general the improvement of the glucose tolerance was not associated with an increased secretion of insulin, so that an extrapancreatic effect of glibenclamide (improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity?) seems to be possible. From clinical and practical point of view the findings would support the opinion that normal weight persons with IGT, particularly in already decreased insulin secretion, have an indication for a glibenclamide therapy.

55411d9f379ddf3f47000001	Which is the most typical peptide sequence responsible for retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal proteins from the Golgi apparatus?	Retention of soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent on their interaction with the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor in the Golgi apparatus and their subsequent retrieval back to the endoplasmic reticulum. the retrieval system for lumenal ER proteins. These proteins carry a specific sorting signal, typically the tetrapeptide KDEL, which is bound by a receptor in the Golgi apparatus. The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s) the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack retrieval of KDEL-containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway The erd2 protein is the receptor responsible for recycling proteins bearing the carboxyl-terminal sequence KDEL (single-letter amino acid code) to the endoplasmic reticulum, following their loss from that organelle by the process of forward transport	['the carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL)']
54d907c84b1fd0d33c000008	Which molecule is targeted by a monoclonal antibody Mepolizumab?	Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.  Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose, or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks.  Among developing therapies, biologics designed to block certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-5 (mepolizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab), have a greater chance of being used in the clinic. Imatinib and mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, may be useful in patients with eosinophilic myositis as part of a hypereosinophilic syndrome.  Recent results of the treatment of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with the anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab showed its efficacy and manageable safety profile.  Individuals also received a segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen (SBP-Ag) 1 month before and after administering a single dose of mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) to reduce airway EOS.  For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events.  Efficacy of anti-interleukin-5 therapy with mepolizumab in patients with asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials. Previous clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-5, in patients with asthma. In this large (616 patients), double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of mepolizumab (a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-5 binding to its receptor), patients were given placebo, 75-, 250- or 750-mg mepolizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for 1 year.  BACKGROUND: We examined levels of hyaluronan, a matrix glycosaminoglycan and versican, a matrix proteoglycan, in the sputum of asthmatics treated with mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) versus placebo to evaluate the utility of these measurements as possible biomarkers of asthma control and airway remodeling.  Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of the key cytokine implicated specifically in eosinophil maturation and survival, interleukin-5, to its receptor. Early studies suggest that inhibition of eosinophilic airway inflammation with mepolizumab-a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5-is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations.  IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).  Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab).  To date, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been developed that bind to human IL-5.  Mepolizumab (Bosatria(®), GlaxoSmithKline) is a biologic agent developed to treat asthma. It represents a humanized monoclonal antibody of IgG1 κ type, which targets human IL-5 and thus prevents its interaction with the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor. There has been a variable effect with the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast and promising early results with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5.  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/κ) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function. Mepolizumab blocks human IL-5 from binding to the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling.  Recently, encouraging results of treatment with monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-5, mepolizumab, have been published. This manuscript reviews the available treatments for HES and the range of side-effects associated with long-term corticosteroid use, and then focuses on the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab.  The therapeutic progress is primarily due to an explosion of biological therapies, particularly four of them very useful for internists (in an off label use) : Interleukin 1 inhibitors (anakinra, Canakinumab) to treat some auto inflammatory diseases (cryopirin associated periodic syndromes and deficency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist), monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5 (mepolizumab) to treat some hypereosinophilic syndromes and Churg and Strauss angiitis, interleukin 6 inhibitiors to treat multifocal Castleman's disease and adult Still disease, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (Bevacizumab) to treat hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES. Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with potent IL-5 neutralizing effects that represents a potential treatment for eosinophilic diseases. Anti-interleukin-5 antibody treatment (mepolizumab) in active eosinophilic oesophagitis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The pharmacodynamic effect of mepolizumab (a humanised anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody) in EoO was evaluated. We studied the prednisone-sparing effect of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, in a rare subgroup of patients who have sputum eosinophilia and airway symptoms despite continued treatment with prednisone.  Subjects received infusions of either mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (29 subjects), or placebo (32) at monthly intervals for 1 year.  A recent study showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL-5, mepolizumab, reduced glucocorticoid therapy in HES patients who did not possess the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation while controlling eosinophilia and preventing recurrence or progression of tissue damage.  METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Mepolizumab: 240563, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, SB 240563. Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical trials with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the treatment of severe asthma, nasal polyposis and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis (the latter two indications are classed as eosinophilia in the phase table).  A previous small dose-finding study found that mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, had no effect on allergen challenge in humans. No effect of anti-interleukin-5 therapy (mepolizumab) on the atopy patch test in atopic dermatitis patients. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5, which reduces peripheral blood eosinophils. Previously, we reported that mepolizumab treatment did not result in clinical improvement in AD.  Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, currently being evaluated, seems promising.  These include imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and more recently, mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody.  Anti-IL-5 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A monoclonal antibody to human interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) was developed for atopic diseases.  Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) reduces baseline bronchial mucosal eosinophils and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the reticular basement membrane in mild asthma.  Skin biopsies were performed in 24 atopic subjects at allergen- and diluent-injected sites before 6 and 48 h after, three infusions of a humanized, monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design.  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a humanized blocking monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) in patients with several forms of hyper-eosinophilic syndromes.  Anti-interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes. Bronchial biopsies were obtained before and after three infusions of a humanized, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) in 24 atopic asthmatics in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  GlaxoSmithKline (formerly SmithKline Beecham) is developing mepolizumab (SB-240563), a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-5, as a potential treatment for asthma and atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Blood, bone marrow, and airway mucosal biopsy specimens were examined before and after anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) treatment of asthmatic individuals in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) therapy induces bone marrow eosinophil maturational arrest and decreases eosinophil progenitors in the bronchial mucosa of atopic asthmatics. The role of eosinophils as effector cells in asthma pathogenesis has been questioned since an anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab), which depleted blood and sputum eosinophils, failed to inhibit allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness.  Mepolizumab (SB-240563), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human IL-5, is currently in clinical trials for treatment of asthma. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that chronic antagonism of IL-5 by mepolizumab in monkeys is safe and has the potential, through long-term reductions in circulating and tissue-resident eosinophils, to be beneficial therapy for chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases. Preclinical efficacy and safety of mepolizumab (SB-240563), a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-5, in cynomolgus monkeys. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/�) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function. BACKGROUND: Mepolizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody, is an effective corticosteroid-sparing agent for patients with Fip1-like 1/platelet-derived growth factor receptor � fusion (F/P)-negative hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/κ) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function Mepolizumab blocks human IL-5 from binding to the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8)	['interleukin-5']
550342a8f8aee20f27000002	Which is the major symptom of the Doose syndrome?	KD is particularly effective in myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE; Doose Syndrome) and West syndrome with 100% and 81.25% of the patients having a greater than 50% seizure reduction, respectively.  Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) - a lamotrigine responsive epilepsy? PURPOSE: Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome) is a difficult to treat idiopathic generalized epilepsy of early childhood. Herman Doose first described the generalized childhood epilepsy syndrome of myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE) in 1970, attributing a genetic cause from this first description.  RECENT FINDINGS: In the past several years, neurologists are finding new indications to use these dietary treatments, perhaps even as first-line therapy, including infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), Dravet syndrome, and status epilepticus (including FIRES syndrome). First long-term experience with the orphan drug rufinamide in children with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome). INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the orphan drug rufinamide (RUF) in children with pharmacoresistant myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome). Mutations in SCN1A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel α1-subunit, are found to be associated with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy or Dravet syndrome (DS), but only rarely with the myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE, or Doose syndrome).  The difficulty early in the course of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is distinguishing this diagnosis from severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) or from myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), as the seizure patterns in these three syndromes may overlap at the onset.  Doose syndrome (myoclonic-astatic epilepsy): 40 years of progress. Doose syndrome, otherwise traditionally known as myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, was first described as a unique epilepsy syndrome by Dr Hermann Doose in 1970. Of 38 patients, 22 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (58%); 6 had myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose (16%); 5 had symptomatic generalized epilepsy, not otherwise specified (13%); and 5 had symptomatic localization-related epilepsy (13%).  With felbamate treatment, 6 patients (16%) became seizure free, including 4 of the 6 patients with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose; 24 patients (63%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Less commonly observed phenotypes include myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE or Doose syndrome), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), infantile spasms, and vaccine-related encephalopathy and seizures. This includes syndromes with multiple etiologies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms; developmental syndromes of unknown etiology, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome; and idiopathic epilepsies, such as myoclonic-astatic (Doose) epilepsy.  It should be considered early in the treatment of Dravet syndrome and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome).  The purpose of this article is to present a short review of the natural history of myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE; Doose syndrome) and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).  [Clinical case of the month. Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy in a young child (MAE) or Doose syndrome]. His refractory epilepsy which started 7 years ago shares symptoms and signs of both epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures (Doose Syndrome) and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. PURPOSE: Before 1986, the spectrum of childhood epilepsies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Doose syndrome (DS), known collectively as "epilepsia myoclonica astatica," was believed to represent a single disease.  We reported a 7-year-old girl with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of early childhood (Doose syndrome).  Other myoclonic epilepsy syndromes with onset in the first year of life (Aicardi's Neonatal (Early) Myoclonic Encephalopathy, West's Syndrome, Dravet's Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy, and Dravet's Benign Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy), in early childhood (Lennox-Gastaut-Dravet Syndrome, Myoclonic Variant of Lennox Gastaut Dravet Syndrome, Myoclonic-Astatic Epilepsy of Doose, Benign Myoclonic Epilepsies (BME), or even in late childhood (Childhood Absence Epilepsy with myoclonias, vs. Myoclonic Absence Epilepsy) are probably genetically complex diseases.  A study of epileptic drop attacks (EDA) by simultaneous video-polygraphic recordings was carried out in one epileptic patient with myoclonic astatic seizures (Doose syndrome).  A number of variants or atypical forms have been proposed. As a result, differential diagnosis presents a major challenge and includes specific generalized epilepsies, i.e., metabolic or inflammatory; secondarily generalized epilepsies, i.e., those arising from the frontal lobe; and severe forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, i.e., Doose syndrome. Video-EEG analysis of drop seizures in myoclonic astatic epilepsy of early childhood (Doose syndrome).  The clinical and EEG pattern, the high familial incidence are shared by the Doose syndrome, of which the present series seems to be a subgroup, as are other well-defined syndromes: benign and severe myoclonic epilepsies of infancy. The difficulty early in the course of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is distinguishing this diagnosis from severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) or from myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), as the seizure patterns in these three syndromes may overlap at the onset.

5118dd1305c10fae75000001	Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women?	Our results show a high prevalence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man RA in LAC women is not only more common but presents with some clinical characteristics that differ from RA presentation in men. Some of those characteristics could explain the high rates of disability and worse prognosis observed in women with RA in LAC Intense anti-CCP2 reaction was 19.8-fold higher in females vs. males,  men (n = 67) and women (n = 225)  Responses to treatment over time were better among men in this prebiologic era; women had worse progression despite similar treatment. BMI appears to be associated with RA disease activity in women, but not in men. A total of 5,161 RA patients (4,082 women and 1,079 men) In women the DAS28 was significantly higher than in men due to higher scores for general health and tender joints. Likewise, HAQ and VAS pain were rated significantly higher in women. 432 females, 125 males ESR significantly increased with age, independent of other variables of disease activity. This increase was more pronounced in male than in female patients Disease patterns in RA vary between the sexes; the condition is more commonly seen in women, who exhibit a more aggressive disease and a poorer long-term outcome. The female to male ratio was 2.5:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 49.4 +/- 14.9 years for women and 55.3 +/-15.6 years for men (P < 0.0003) in 244 female and 91 male patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

534ebb59288f4dae47000004	Which methyl-CpG-binding protein when mutant becomes the hallmark for Rett syndrome?	Rett syndrome (RTT) results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and is characterized by abnormal motor, respiratory and autonomic control, cognitive impairment, autistic-like behaviors and increased risk of seizures.  Rett syndrome (RTT) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). Severely arrhythmic breathing is a hallmark of Rett syndrome (RTT) and profoundly affects quality of life for patients and their families. The last decade has seen the identification of the disease-causing gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) and the development of mouse models that phenocopy many aspects of the human syndrome, including breathing dysfunction. Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in females, typically after the first year of life. It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. MECP2 assists in the transcriptional silencing process via DNA methylation; we hypothesize that disruption of this gene alters the normal developmental expression of various other genes, some of which must account for the peculiar neurologic phenotype of RTT. Molecular studies have identified MECP2 mutations in up to 80% of classic RTT patients; mutation type has some effect on the phenotypic manifestation of RTT, but the pattern of X inactivation seems to determine phenotypic severity.

5519110f622b19434500000c	Which disease is included as an additional feature in the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome?	Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS, MIM #609460) is an autosomal recessive disorder of intellectual disability, specific facial gestalt and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) is a rare clinical disorder characterized by central and enteric nervous system defects. Thus, our data indicate that KBP is involved in neuronal differentiation and that the central and enteric nervous system defects seen in GOSHS are likely caused by microtubule-related defects. Mutations in Kif1-binding protein/KIAA1279 (KBP) cause the devastating neurological disorder Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GSS) in humans. We describe a brother and sister with Hirschsprung disease, hypotonia, and ptosis. Their condition resembles that in 2 sibs reported by Goldberg and Shprintzen. A 5-year-old girl with Hirschsprung disease, unusual facial appearance, psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and congenital heart disease is reported Cranial computed tomography demonstrated abnormal findings that may suggest defective neuronal migration and/or dysgenesis of the brain In 1981, Goldberg and Shprintzen described siblings with short-segment Hirschsprung disease, cleft palate, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, short stature and distinctive facial appearance. A consanguineous family with Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and mental retardation (Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome) Hirschsprung disease, mental retardation, microcephaly, and specific craniofacial dysmorphism were observed in three children from a large, consanguineous, Moroccan family The patient showed dysmorphic facies and weakness of connective tissue, and was scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm. We report on maternal half-sibs born to unaffected, non-consanguineous parents with classical Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) who had in addition intestinal malrotation and an aberrant subclavian artery keletal abnormalities common to 3 of them include bowing of long bones (with a variable degree of progression over time), flare of the metaphyses, a large anterior fontanel with persistent patency into the second to fourth years of life, 13 pairs of ribs, distinct vertebral abnormalities which were absent neonatally but evolved by the second year of life, and progressive osteopenia. Marfanoid phenotype with craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome) is a rare disorder previously described in only 5 patients. Mutation in fibrillin-1 and the Marfanoid-craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg) syndrome Additional common findings include other craniofacial anomalies, hypotonia, obstructive apnea, foot deformity, and congenital weakness of the abdominal wall  The radiological features were characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches Aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome: a case report Annuloaortic ectasia due to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is reported Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is an extremely rare syndrome with a characteristic face. This is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid features. The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising craniosynostosis, a marfanoid habitus and skeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, and connective-tissue anomalies. Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period, developmental delay, and inguinal or umbilical hernia.  Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by marfanoid habitus and additional dysmorphic stigmata. Overall intelligibility, language, articulation, voice and resonance characteristics in a child with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a rare disorder characterized by a Marfan-like habitus, mental retardation and craniosynostosis.  Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by: craniosynostosis of the coronal, sagittal, or lambdoid sutures; dolichocephaly; distinctive craniofacial features; skeletal changes (dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, pes planus, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis, joint hypermobility or contractures and C1/C2 spine malformation); neurologic abnormalities; intellectual disability; and brain anomalies (hydrocephalus, dilatation of the lateral ventricles, and Chiari 1 malformation). Cardiovascular anomalies may include mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation/incompetence, aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation. Minimal subcutaneous fat, abdominal wall defects, myopia, and cryptorchidism in males, are also characteristic findings. Surgical treatment for scoliosis in patients with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus. We identified, by homozygosity mapping, a novel locus on 10q21.3-q22.1 for Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) in a consanguineous Moroccan family. Phenotypic features of GOSHS in this inbred family included microcephaly and mental retardation, which are both central nervous system defects, as well as Hirschsprung disease, an enteric nervous system defect We demonstrate that homozygous nonsense mutations in KIAA1279 at 10q22.1, encoding a protein with two tetratrico peptide repeats, underlie this syndromic form of Hirschsprung disease and generalized polymicrogyria, establishing the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system development We report on four children in whom was diagnosed a neurocristopathy, associating Hirschsprung's disease with a wide spectrum of neurologic abnormalities. The patients included two children presenting the phenotypic features of the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome: distinct dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and mental retardation, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cortical malformations associated with intractable seizures in one child. The third newborn presented with the Haddad syndrome: short-segment Hirschsprung's disease associated with the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome requiring permanent artificial ventilation Therefore, awareness of a possible neurocristopathy associated with neurologic abnormalities should be taken into account in any patient newly diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease to detect the abnormalities early and promptly manage them	['Craniosynostosis']
550c3754a103b78016000007	Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?	Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms. The majority of cases are idiopathic and characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing fibrillar α-synuclein Parkinson's disease is characterized by α-synuclein pathology in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites Parkinson's disease is characterized by neuronal death in the substantia nigra and the presence of intracellular inclusions of α-synuclein in the Lewy bodies Parkinson's disease, also known as paralysis agitans, is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, with onset usually between the ages of 50 and 65 years, and is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the subsantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies The protein α-synuclein is well recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies are common disorders of the aging population and characterized by the progressive accumulation of �-synuclein (�-syn) in the central nervous system. AF-LB and Parkinsons disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by abnormal deposition of �-synuclein aggregates in many regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. A number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy are characterized by the formation and intraneuronal accumulation of fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein in affected brain regions. They have been a long time the hallmark of Parkinsons disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons Disease (PD). Although Parkinsons disease with later dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are pathologically characterized by the presence of intraneuronal Lewy inclusion bodies, amyloid deposition is also associated to varying degrees with both these disorders. Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegnerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. However, it seems that Braak staging can not explain difference in severity of autonomic failure between DLB and PD. As a possibility, in DLB patients with significant autonomic failure, Lewy bodies may have been localized to the peripheral autonomic nervous system in a long time before onset of dementia or parkinsonism, and propagation of Lewy bodies into the central nervous system may be initiated by apparition of certain promotion factor, such as ageing and amyloid-�. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy bodies in the surviving SN neurons, as well as other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system These include multiple system atrophy (MSA), characterized by accumulation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and Lewy body disorders, including Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and the so-called "pure" autonomic failure	["Parkinson's disease (PD)"]

53357193d6d3ac6a34000047	Which JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis?	Tofacitinib: The First Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Preclinical to clinical translation of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in rheumatoid arthritis. The preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis (mCIA) model was compared with clinical PK/PD data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). With tofacitinib, the first Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor has been approved in the USA, as well as in Switzerland and other countries.  Tofacitinib, which is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has shown clinical effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis.   In patients treated with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, RR for hypercholesterolaemia was 1.70 (1.10 to 2.63) that was dose related.  After two decades of research and development activity focussed on orally active kinase inhibitors, the first such drug (the JAK inhibitor Xeljanz, tofacitinib) was approved by the FDA in November 2012 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  JAK inhibitor tofacitinib for treating rheumatoid arthritis: from basic to clinical. An orally available JAK3 inhibitor, tofacitinib, has been applied for RA, with satisfactory effects and acceptable safety in multiple clinical examinations.  Subsequently, multiple phase 3 studies were carried out, and tofacitinib with or without methotrexate (MTX) is efficacious and has a manageable safety profile in active RA patients who are MTX naïve or show inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-IR, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor-IR. Taken together, an orally available kinase inhibitor tofacitinib targeting JAK-mediated signals would be expected to be a new option for RA treatment. A non-selective JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, has recently been approved to treat myelofibrosis whereas tofacitinib is poised for approval to treat rheumatoid arthritis.  The recent disclosure of the clinical efficacy of a selective JAK1 inhibitor (GLPG-0634) in rheumatoid arthritis and detailed disclosure of the some potent and highly selective JAK1 inhibitors provide a clear stimulus for further activity in this area.  These results suggest that the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib suppresses osteoclast-mediated structural damage to arthritic joints, and this effect is secondary to decreased RANKL production. More recently, the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib has been evaluated as a potential new treatment option in RA and is awaiting approval. A total of 140 patients were randomised to tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10 mg or placebo twice daily and the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12, a primary end point, was significant for all tofacitinib treatment groups. Thus, an orally available tofacitinib in combination with MTX was efficacious and had a manageable safety profile. Tofacitinib at 5 and 10 mg twice a day appears suitable for further evaluation to optimise the treatment of RA. Moreover, induction of IL-10 production by DCs can be one mechanism of action of the JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) which have shown high efficiency on active rheumatoid arthritis in clinical trials. Recently, CP-690,550 (tofacitinib), originally developed as a JAK3 inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in phase III clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models, but the precise mechanism of the effect, especially with respect to Th17 cells, is poorly understood.   Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a novel JAK inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 6 dosages of oral tofacitinib (CP-690,550) with placebo for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients receiving a stable background regimen of methotrexate (MTX) who have an inadequate response to MTX monotherapy.  In patients with active RA in whom the response to MTX has been inadequate, the addition of tofacitinib at a dosage ≥3 mg twice daily showed sustained efficacy and a manageable safety profile over 24 weeks. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 5 doses of oral tofacitinib (CP-690,550) or adalimumab monotherapy with placebo for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Tofacitinib monotherapy at ≥3 mg twice a day was efficacious in the treatment of patients with active RA over 24 weeks and demonstrated a manageable safety profile. The new JAK3 inhibitor, CP690,550, has shown efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. CP-690,550 is a potent and selective JAK inhibitor currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune disease indications. Co-administration of the JAK inhibitor CP-690,550 and methotrexate is well tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis without need for dose adjustment. To investigate the effects of methotrexate (MTX) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CP-690,550, a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development as a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to determine the effects of multiple doses of CP-690,550 on the PK of MTX, and to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of co-administration of CP-690,550 and MTX.  Improved pain, physical functioning and health status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with CP-690,550, an orally active Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor: results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. CP-690,550 was efficacious in improving the pain, function and health status of patients with RA, from week 1 to week 6. Our findings indicate that CP-690,550 is efficacious in the treatment of RA, resulting in rapid, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful reductions in the signs and symptoms of RA. INCB18424 targeting Jak1/2 and CP690,550 targeting Jak3 has been developed and is now on phase II clinical study for RA.	['tofacitinib']

51405cd123fec90375000005	Which is the defective protein causing the lysosomal storage disease Fabry?	The lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease is characterized by excessive globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in major organs such as the heart and kidney. Defective lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (Gla) is responsible for excessive Gb3 accumulation, and one cell sensitive to the effects of Gb3 accumulation is vascular endothelium. Anderson-Fabry disease (referred to as Fabry disease) is an X-linked disorder characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A and the subsequent accumulation in various tissues of globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)), the main substrate of the defective enzyme. Human alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22; alpha-Gal A) is the lysosomal exoglycosidase responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-galactosyl residues from glycoconjugates and is the defective enzyme causing Fabry disease (McKusick 301500). Transgenic mice expressing a human mutant alpha-galactosidase with an R301Q substitution, which was found in a patient with a variant form of Fabry disease, were established.

56c1f040ef6e394741000055	Which antibodies cause Riedel thyroiditis?	LEARNING POINTS: There are potential clinical applications of identifying subsets of patients with IgG4 thyroiditis (FVHT and Riedel thyroiditis). The importance of IgG4 in the predictive model of thyroiditis. Increased lymphangiogenesis in Riedel thyroiditis (Immunoglobulin G4-related thyroid disease). The present study describes in depth a case of Riedel thyroiditis (RT) to clarify its pathogenesis and its putative inclusion in the spectrum of IgG4-related disease.  Our findings support the inclusion of RT within the spectrum of IgG4-related thyroid disease (IgG4-RTD). Although the etiology and physiopathology of IgG4-RTD still remain elusive, the results obtained in the present case suggest the participation of lymphatic vessels in the pathogenesis of RT. More than 80 % of the left thyroid lobe was effaced by fibrosis and inflammation (lymphocytes, 57 IgG4+ plasma cells per 1 high-power field, an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.67, and eosinophils) with extension into the surrounding tissues and occlusive phlebitis.  Diagnosed early as Riedel disease, the high serum IgG4, immunohistopathology and decreased fibrosis with corticosteroid therapy, finally confirm for the first time, the origin of IgG4-RSD fibrosis of the thyroid.  While IgG4-RSD is well documented in the pancreas and other organs, it is poorly characterized in the thyroid gland.  He was careful to distinguish this from Riedel thyroiditis but it has become clear that fibrosis and atrophy of the thyroid are indeed components of Hashimoto thyroiditis, and in rare cases IgG4-related sclerosing disease may be an outcome.  The relationship between HT and Riedel thyroiditis remains unclear; however, recent evidence seems to suggest that it may also be part of the spectrum of Ig4-related sclerosing disease.   One patient with advanced thyroid fibrosis associated with Riedel thyroiditis and a history of disease in multiple other organ systems did not have improvement in the thyroid gland, but the disease did not progress to involve new organs.  IgG4RD may be present in a certain proportion of patients with a wide variety of diseases, including Mikulicz's disease, autoimmune pancreatitis, hypophysitis, Riedel thyroiditis, interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, prostatitis, lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory pseudotumor.

51588bb2d24251bc05000091	Which antiepileptic drug is most strongly associated with spina bifida? 	The teratogenicity of antiepilepsy drug valproic acid (VPA) mostly is found in genetic and somatic levels, causing teratogenesis involving neurotubular defects (NTDs), anencephaly, lumbosacral meningomyelocele, and leg dysfunction due to spina bifida aperta. The summary odds ratio estimate for the association between valproic acid and spina bifida was 11.9 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.0-21.2); for valproic acid and cleft palate 5.8 (95% UI: 3.3-9.5); for carbamazepine and spina bifida 3.6 (95% UI: 1.3-7.8); and for carbamazepine and cleft palate 2.4 (95% UI: 1.1-4.5) in the United States. Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy.  Valproic acid, a drug commonly used to treat seizures and other psychiatric disorders, causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in exposed fetuses at a rate 20 times higher than in the general population. Failure of the neural tube to close during development results in exencephaly or anencephaly, as well as spina bifida. Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid.  Fetal exposure to valproic acid or carbamazepine increases the risk of neural tube defect (NTD) Women with epilepsy giving birth during 1973 to 1991 were identified by record linkage of Swedish health registries. Among 3,625 identified infants, 9 had spina bifida. A nested case-control study was performed, comparing drugs used in early pregnancy in the 9 cases and in 18 controls, matched for year of delivery, maternal age, and parity. Six of the spina bifida mothers had used carbamazepine and two had used valproic acid. Among the controls, 5 women used carbamazepine and one valproic acid. There is an apparent excess risk for spina bifida after use of either of these two drugs, but it is not statistically significant when the analysis is restricted to drug-using women. T A significant association was seen between maternal use of valproic acid and spina bifida, and a weaker, non-significant one between carbamazepine and spina bifida. A statistically significant association between Spina Bifida and Valproic Acid (odds ratio 22.7; Fisher p value = 0.0364) was observed: no other anticonvulsant tested showed any association with any type of malformation.

In these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s and decrease SR Ca²⁺ leak. The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, and the more specific derivative S107 (2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-1,4-benzothiazepine), are thought to improve skeletal muscle function by stabilizing the RyR1-FKBP12 complex. In this article, we synthesize derivatives of the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothiazepine channel inhibitor 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties. K201 (JTV519), a benzothiazepine derivative, has been shown to possess anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective properties, but the mechanism of its action is both complex and controversial.

55241f9e2c8b63434a000004	What kind of enzyme is encoded by the proto-oncogene ABL1?	The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, transduces diverse extracellular signals to protein networks that control proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. ABL1 was first identified as an oncogene required for the development of leukaemias initiated by retroviruses or chromosome translocations.  Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. ABL-family proteins comprise one of the best conserved branches of the tyrosine kinases. Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3-Src homology 2-tyrosine kinase) domain cassette, which confers autoregulated kinase activity and is common among nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. This cassette is coupled to an actin-binding and -bundling domain, which makes ABL proteins capable of connecting phosphoregulation with actin-filament reorganization. Two vertebrate paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, have evolved to perform specialized functions.  Protein tyrosine kinases form a large family of signaling proteins implicated in both normal and malignant cell signaling. The aim of this study was to identify protein tyro-sine kinases that can transform hematopoietic cells to growth factor independent proliferation when constitutively activated by homodimerization. We used a modified retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen with a retroviral vector containing the homodimerization domain of ETV6 followed by an artificial splice donor site. Integration of this retroviral vector within a gene of the host genome would generate a fusion transcript containing the dimerization domain and part of the disrupted gene. Using this strategy with the IL3 dependent Ba/F3 cell line, we identified 8 different protein tyrosine kinases (Abl1, Fgfr1, Hck, Jak2, Lck, Mertk, Mst1r, Tnk1) that transformed the cells. Three families of tyrosine kinases have long been recognized to play critical roles in TCR-dependent signaling. They are the Src, zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa, and Tec families of kinases. More recently, the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinases have been shown to be activated by TCR engagement and to be required for maximal TCR signaling. Using T-cell conditional knockout mice deficient for Abl family kinases, Abl (Abl1) and Abl-related gene (Arg) (Abl2), it was recently shown that loss of Abl kinases results in defective T-cell development and a partial block in the transition to the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage.  ABL family tyrosine kinases are tightly regulated by autoinhibition and phosphorylation mechanisms. These kinases maintain an inactive conformation through intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 domains. RIN1, a downstream effector of RAS, binds to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains and stimulates ABL tyrosine kinase activity. RIN1 binding to the ABL2 kinase resulted in a large decrease in Km and a small increase in Vmax toward an ABL consensus substrate peptide. RIN1 increased the kinase activity of both ABL1 and ABL2, and this occurred in the presence or absence of ABL regulatory domains outside the SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase domain core. Constitutively activated mutants of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral (v-abl) homolog (1) protein) and JAK2 (JAnus Kinase 2 or Just Another Kinase 2) play a central role in the pathogenesis of clinically and morphologically distinct chronic myeloproliferative disorders but are also found in some cases of de novo acute leukemia and lymphoma. Abl1 (previously known as Abl) and the Abl1-related gene product Abl2 (previously known as Arg) define a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate actin structure and presynaptic axon guidance. Here we show that the Abl kinases are critical mediators of postsynaptic assembly downstream of agrin and MuSK.  The ABL1 proto-oncogene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion and stress response. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results.

52ee9f55c8da898910000009	What is the mode of inheritance of Romano Ward long QT syndrome?	KCNQ1 is associated with two different entities of LQTS, the autosomal-dominant Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), and the autosomal-recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) characterized by bilateral deafness in addition to cardiac arrhythmias. The Romano Ward long QT syndrome (LQTS) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The genetic forms of LQTS include Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), which is characterized by isolated LQTS and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and syndromes with LQTS in association with other conditions. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, deafness, and autosomal-recessive inheritance, and the Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by a prolonged QT interval, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and no deafness.  Different mutations in KVLQT1 cause the dominant Romano-Ward (RW) syndrome and the recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome, which, in addition to cardiac abnormalities, includes congenital deafness.  The Romano-Ward syndrome shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and normal hearing.  The Romano-Ward syndrome is of autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance.  Romano-Ward syndrome is a subtype of prolonged QT syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance.  A family with the Romano-Ward syndrome is presented.

5717dbfe7de986d80d000001	What is the functional role of the protein Drp1?	dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fission, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a protein required for mitochondrial network division. dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission Mitochondrial fission is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), Drp1 is a dynamin-like GTPase that mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal division in a process dependent on self-assembly and coupled to GTP hydrolysis.  Mitochondrial fission requires the dynamin GTPase Drp1, which assembles in a ring around the mitochondrion and appears to constrict both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. DRP1; a mitochondrial fission protein Mitochondrial morphology is primarily controlled by the activation of dynamin-related proteins including dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promotes mitochondrial fission.  The change in mitochondrial morphology was caused by downregulation of the expression of Fis1 and Drp1, two proteins regulating mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi. These results collectively indicate that ER-specific BNIP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in a BH3 domain-dependent fashion. In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes. Mitochondrial remodeling was associated with increased proximity between Rab11a and mitochondrial membranes, changes in fusion-fission dynamics, and mitochondrial relocalization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was regulated by the Rab11a effector protein FIP1/RCP. Functional analysis demonstrated that BNIP1 expression increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression followed by the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission. Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission in oxygen sensing and constriction of the ductus arteriosus. In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined In this study, we investigate the role of mitochondrial fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in myogenic differentiation Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission in oxygen sensing and constriction of the ductus arteriosus Functional analysis demonstrated that BNIP1 expression increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression followed by the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission These results collectively indicate that ER-specific BNIP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in a BH3 domain-dependent fashion Glucocorticoid modulation of mitochondrial function in hepatoma cells requires the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. Mitochondria in DRG neurons undergo hyperglycemic mediated injury through Bim, Bax and the fission protein Drp1. This novel function for DRP1 is distinct from its recognized role in regulating mitochondrial fission.  Abnormal interaction between the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease neurons: implications for mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage. SUMOylation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 occurs at multiple nonconsensus sites within the B domain and is linked to its activity cycle. Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial fission through modification of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. We highlight posttranslational modifications of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, for which these regulatory mechanisms are best characterized. Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi. Functionally, PINK1 knockdown and overexpression had opposite effects on dendritic spine formation and neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity. In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined.	['mitochondrial fission']
56cf20eb3975bb303a000001	What does isradipine do to L-type channels?	The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. Systemic administration of isradipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of L-type channels, forces dopaminergic neurons in rodents to revert to a juvenile, Ca(2+)-independent mechanism to generate autonomous activity. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. What distinguishes snail and mammalian L-type channels is a difference in dihydropyridine sensitivity: 100 nM isradipine exhibits a significant block of mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 currents without effect on snail LCa(v)1 currents. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. During control stimulation of the presynaptic GABAergic neuron at 40 Hz for 1-2 s, DeltaF/F(0) increased rapidly to a peak value and started to decline shortly after the train ended, returning to baseline within 10-20 s. The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. The L-type channel antagonist isradipine is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

Effects of isradipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker on permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. Omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N type calcium channel antagonist and flunarizine, a nonselective T-type calcium channel antagonist were without effect. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.	['antagonizes', 'blocks']
56ed0ffe2ac5ed1459000008	Which type of myeloma is ixazomib being evaluated for?	Next generation proteasome inhibitors include carfilzomib and oprozomib which are irreversible epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors; and ixazomib and delanzomib which are reversible boronic acid proteasome inhibitors. Two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and carfilzomib are FDA approved drugs and ixazomib and oprozomib are in late stage clinical trials.  The disease focus for all the proteasome inhibitors is multiple myeloma. In addition, novel drug classes have shown promising activity in RR MM, including the orally-administered proteasome inhibitors ixazomib and oprozomib; monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab; and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat and rocilinostat. These findings have informed the subsequent clinical development of ixazomib in multiple myeloma. Phase 1 study of twice-weekly ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients. An evidence-based review of ixazomib citrate and its potential in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Phase 1 study of weekly dosing with the investigational oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT imaging in an IL-6- and MYC-driven mouse model of human multiple myeloma affords objective evaluation of plasma cell tumor progression and therapeutic response to the proteasome inhibitor ixazomib. Sixty patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled on this phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent, oral ixazomib given weekly for 3 of 4 weeks. Sixty patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled on this phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent, oral ixazomib given weekly for 3 of 4 weeks Among second-generation proteasome inhibitors, ixazomib (MLN9708) is the first oral compound to be evaluated for the treatment of MM Sixty patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled on this phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent, oral ixazomib given weekly for 3 of 4 weeks.  Ixazomib is the first investigational oral proteasome inhibitor to be studied clinically. In this phase 1 trial, 60 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (median of 4 prior lines of therapy; bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and carfilzomib/marizomib in 88%, 88%, 62%, and 5%, respectively) received single-agent ixazomib 0.24 to 2.23 mg/m(2) (days 1, 4, 8, 11; 21-day cycles).  Safety and tolerability of ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma: an open-label phase 1/2 study. In a phase 1/2 trial we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: We enrolled patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma aged 18 years or older with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and no grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, and treated them with oral ixazomib (days 1, 8, 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to 12 28-day cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with ixazomib alone.  Among second-generation proteasome inhibitors, ixazomib (MLN9708) is the first oral compound to be evaluated for the treatment of MM. Ixazomib has shown improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters compared with bortezomib, in addition to similar efficacy in the control of myeloma growth and prevention of bone loss. Among 55 response-evaluable patients, 15% achieved partial response or better (76% stable disease or better). These findings have informed the subsequent clinical development of ixazomib in multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is an investigational, orally bioavailable 20S proteasome inhibitor. Sixty patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled on this phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent, oral ixazomib given weekly for 3 of 4 weeks.

5177def18ed59a060a000034	Which is the molecular mechanism underlying K-ras alterations in carcinomas?	activating mutations in KRAS are identified in most pancreatic cancers Mutations at codon 12 of the K-ras gene are present in 65%-100% of carcinomas of human exocrine pancreas and could be used as a potential tumor marker at the tissue level. Activating point mutations in the K-Ras oncogene are among the most common genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer, occurring early in the progression of the disease. Activating K-ras mutations are found in approximately 90% of pancreatic carcinomas and may contribute to the poor prognosis of these tumors. Five of the seven duct lesions harbored activating point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras; a G to A transition was found in four and a G to C transversion in one. Ki-RAS mutations in 38% of the overall series KRAS exon 2 mutations were detected in a total of 62 patients with the two methods combined, comprising 11 different mutant alleles. gain-of-function mutations in ras genes were the first specific genetic alterations identified in human cancer	['Point mutations']
56f4011709dd18d46b000003	What is the main symptom of Marfan syndrome patients?	The diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome remain controversial. It is of utmost importance to identify patients at risk for acute aortic events to establish the correct surgical timing and the appropriate surgical treatment The not-uncommon spinal abnormalities associated with Marfan's syndrome rarely undergird clinical problems, and neurological features accompanying such bone abnormalities are rare. The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation.  For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of "arachnodactyly". Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder caused mainly by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes.  The characteristics of acute aortic dissection among young Chinese patients: a comparison between Marfan syndrome and non-Marfan syndrome patients. The main objective of this trial is to assess whether losartan treatment leads to a clinically relevant decrease of aortic dilatation in adult patients with Marfan syndrome. During a 16-year period, 300 patients with presumed Marfan syndrome underwent 398 operations on the aorta and branch arteries, including 125 aortic root operations, 59 aortic arch repairs, 31 descending thoracic aortic repairs, and 178 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs.

51635202298dcd4e5100004f	How is myotonic dystrophy inherited?	Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder caused by a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion located in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 gene (ZNF9 gene) on chromosome 3q 21.3. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by an expansion of a CTG triplet repeat in the DMPK gene. Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder. DM is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, muscular dystrophy, myotonia, and multisystem involvement. Type 1 DM (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)(n) expansion in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK in 19q13.3. proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) and type 2 DM (DM2) but without the DM1 mutation, showed linkage to the 3q21 region and were recently shown to segregate a (CCTG)(n) expansion mutation in intron 1 of ZNF9. All patients have the DM2 (CCTG)(n) expansion. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular, degenerative and progressive disease, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. The worldwide intergenerational behavior of the DM1 mutation is similar in Costa Rica Dystrophic myotonia is a sufficiently rare disease inherited mainly by the autosomal dominant type.

5506ce078e1671127b00000b	Which protein phosphatase has been found to interact with the heat shock protein, HSP20?	 Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.  Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling.  Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20.

54fc99f36ad7dcbc12000004	Neurostimulation of which nucleus is used for treatment of dystonia?	Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS was performed in five SD patients and unilateral ventralis oralis anterior and posterior (Voa/Vop) nucleus of the thalamus DBS in two post-stroke hemiballismus patients.  BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum (GPi-DBS) is effective for various types of drug-refractory primary dystonias.  METHODS: In the parent trial, 40 patients were randomly assigned to either sham neurostimulation or neurostimulation of the internal globus pallidus for a period of 3 months and thereafter all patients completed 6 months of active neurostimulation. 38 patients agreed to be followed up annually after the activation of neurostimulation, including assessments of dystonia severity, pain, disability, and quality of life. INTERPRETATION: 3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia. This long-term observation provides further evidence in favour of pallidal neurostimulation as a first-line treatment for patients with medically intractable, segmental, or generalised dystonia. We describe a patient who received bilateral globus pallidus internus DBS for dystonia with initially good clinical response, but the device eventually failed.  Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis cerebral palsy: a prospective pilot study. Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown.  INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP.  Pallidal deep-brain stimulation in primary generalized or segmental dystonia. BACKGROUND: Neurostimulation of the internal globus pallidus has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of primary dystonia.  CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation for 3 months was more effective than sham stimulation in patients with primary generalized or segmental dystonia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) on mood and cognitive performance in patients with dystonia before surgery (at baseline, while patients received their usual treatment) and 12 months postoperatively (while patients received neurostimulation and their medications) in a multicenter prospective study.  CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal stimulation has a good benefit-to-risk ratio as it did not negatively affect cognitive performance and mood in primary dystonia, while a significant motor improvement was obtained. Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes.  Bilateral deep-brain stimulation of the globus pallidus in primary generalized dystonia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, controlled, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 22 patients with primary generalized dystonia.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the efficacy and safety of the use of bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in selected patients with primary generalized dystonia. Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients. This suggests that neurostimulation of the VIM may be an effective treatment for myoclonus in pharmacologically intractable IMDS. We report on the effects of bilateral neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) in a patient with medically intractable and progressing inherited myoclonus dystonia syndrome (IMDS).  Neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus in inherited myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. Pallidal and thalamic neurostimulation in severe tardive dystonia. After informed consent, a bilateral stereotactic electrode placement targeting the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) was performed. Stimulation of the VIM did not improve the hyperkinetic movements and simultaneous stimulation of both the GPi and the VIM did not result in any additional benefit.  Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. 3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia.

532f0bd6d6d3ac6a3400002d	What is the mode of inheritance of Marchesani syndrome?	Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant WMS cannot be distinguished by clinical findings alone.  Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a well-characterized disorder in which patients develop eye and skeletal abnormalities. Autosomal-recessive and autosomal-dominant forms of WMS are caused by mutations in ADAMTS10 and FBN1 genes, respectively.  Finally, WMS is transmitted either by an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance, GD by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and AD by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.  Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare condition characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye abnormalities including microspherophakia, ectopia of lens, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) modes of inheritance have been described for WMS. Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a connective tissue disorder characterised by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye anomalies including microspherophakia, ectopia of the lenses, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) modes of inheritance have been described and a gene for AR WMS has recently been mapped to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant modes of inheritance have been described in association with WMS.  We report 6 patients with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (with or without ocular involvement) in three generations, identified by screening 26 members of two families. This is the largest family in the literature showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Weill-Marchesani syndrome comprises short stature, brachydactyly, microspherophakia, glaucoma, and ectopia lentis is regarded as an autosomal recessive trait We present two families each with affected individuals in 3 generations demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance of Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare, generalized disorder of connective tissue manifested by short stature, brachymorphia, and spherophakia. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.

56c5feb75795f9a73e000006	Which is the most common CFTR mutation in Caucasians?	Exposure to WCS caused a pronounced reduction in CFTR activity in both CFTR (+/+) cells and F508del CFTR (+/-) cell Moreover, the common heterozygous F508del/5T and F508del/R117H were observed in 17 and 4% of CBAVD cases respectively, and the allele frequency in CBAVD was 17% for F508del, 25% for 5T and 3% for R117H. The most common mutations were p.F508del (DeltaF508) (18.1%), c.2183_2184delAAinsG (2183AA>G) (6.5%), p.S466X (5.8%), p.N1303K (4.3%), c.2789+5G>A (4.3%), p.G542X (3.6%), c.3120+1G>A (3.6%), p.R334W (2.9%) and c.3130delA (2.9%). These 9 types of mutant CFTR genes totaled for 52% of all CFTR genes derived from the 69 Iranian CF patients. Eight mutations, c.406-8T>C, p.A566D, c.2576delA, c.2752-1_2756delGGTGGCinsTTG, p.T1036I, p.W1145R, c.3850-24G>A, c.1342-?_1524+?del, were found for the first time in this study. The commonest CFTR mutation, deltaF508, is found in 74.1% of all CF chromosomes. In the Caucasian CF population, 57.5% are deltaF508 homozygotes but the UK ISC CF population with only 24.7%, has significantly fewer deltaF508 homozygotes patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.4). Although the major mutation that results in a single amino acid deletion (F508) accounts for 70% of the disease alleles, more than 550 additional mutant alleles of different forms have been detected. Besides the major 3-bp deletion, delta F508 that was found on 73% of German CF chromosomes, more than 50 other missense, nonsense, frame-shift, and splice-site mutations have already been identified. However, the CFTR mutation delta F508 is the most common reason for the frequently inherited disease among the Caucasian population. Maturation and processing of delta F508-CFTR is defective which leads to expression of only very little but functional CFTR in the cell membrane. The most common disease-causing mutation, DeltaF508, is found in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis.   Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited lethal disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), of which the cftr ΔF508 mutation is the most common. Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited lethal disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), of which the cftr ΔF508 mutation is the most common. Caucasians (eight of nine), Northern Irish (four of five), and Israelis (three of three) also occurred in other Caucasian groups. The preponderance of previously reported mutations in these three groups suggested that a subset of the non-delta F508 mutations occur in common among Caucasians.	['deltaF508']

56c1f010ef6e394741000041	Simpson grading is used to describe resection of which brain tumor?	The impact of age (≤ 70 vs.>70 years), sex, tumor diameter (<6 vs. ≥ 6 cm), pre- and postoperative KPS (<80 vs. ≥ 80), Simpson grade (I-II vs. III-IV), and World Health Organization (WHO) histologic grade (I vs. II-III) on survival was assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences in survival between groups of patients were compared. A multivariate analysis adjusted for age, pre- and postoperative KPS, Simpson grade, tumor diameter, and WHO histologic grade also was performed.RESULTS: The fronto-orbito-basal approach (n = 22) allowed a significantly greater percentage of Simpson I-II removals than the bifrontal (n = 70) and pterional approach (n = 21) (P = 0.0354 and P = 0.0485, respectively).  Simpson Grade I-III Resection of Spinal Atypical (World Health Organization Grade II) Meningiomas is Associated With Symptom Resolution and Low Recurrence. Simpson grade I, II, III, and IV resection were achieved in 3 (15%), 13 (65%), 2 (10%), and 2 (10%) tumors, respectively. One patient that underwent Simpson grade III resection received adjuvant radiation therapy. After Simpson grade I-III or gross total resection, no tumors recurred (0%; confidence interval, 0%-17.6%). After Simpson grade IV resection, 1 tumor recurred (50%; confidence interval, 1.3%-98.7%).   The Simpson grading system was used to assess the extent of surgical resection. Simpson grade: an opportunity to reassess the need for complete resection of meningiomas. BACKGROUND: The relevance of the Simpson grading system as a predictor of meningioma progression or recurrence in modern neurosurgical practice has recently been called into question. The aim of our study was to compare the risk of progression/recurrence of tumours that had been treated with different Simpson grade resections in a contemporary population of benign (WHO grade I) meningioma patients. RESULTS: The three-year progression/recurrence-free survival rates for patients receiving Simpson grade 1, 2 or 4 resections were 95 %, 87 % and 67 %, respectively. Simpson grade 4 resections progressed/recurred at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.26, P = 0.04), whereas Simpson grade 2 resections did not progress/recur at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (HR = 1.78, P = 0.29). Effect of dural detachment on long-term tumor control for meningiomas treated using Simpson grade IV resection. The Simpson grading system classifies incomplete resections into a single category, namely Simpson Grade IV, with wide variations in the volume and location of residual tumors, making it complicated to evaluate the achievement of surgical goals and predict the prognosis of these tumors. Authors of the present study investigated the factors related to necessity of retreatment and tried to identify any surgical nuances achievable with the aid of modern neurosurgical techniques for meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection.METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients with WHO Grade I meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection as the initial therapy at the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 1995 and April 2010.  Stereotactic radiosurgery provides equivalent tumor control to Simpson Grade 1 resection for patients with small- to medium-size meningiomas. Multivariate analysis revealed that no dural detachment (hazard ratio [HR]6.42, 95% CI 1.41-45.0; p = 0.02) and skull base location (HR 11.6, 95% CI 2.18-218; p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for the necessity of early retreatment, whereas postresection tumor volume of 4 cm(3) or more was not a statistically significant risk factor.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Simpson Grade I, II, and III resections, Simpson Grade IV resection includes highly heterogeneous tumors in terms of resection rate and location of the residual mass. Despite the difficulty in analyzing such diverse data, these results draw attention to the favorable effect of dural detachment (instead of maximizing the resection rate) on long-term tumor control. Surgical strategy with an emphasis on detaching the tumor from the affected dura might be another important option in resection of high-risk meningiomas not amenable to gross-total resection. The relevance of Simpson Grade I and II resection in modern neurosurgical treatment of World Health Organization Grade I meningiomas. Surgery for convexity meningioma: Simpson Grade I resection as the goal: clinical article. However, for skull base meningiomas, in which mostly Simpson Grade II resection is achieved, the use of this classification should be further validated. 	['meningioma']

Cep135 is a 135-kDa, coiled-coil centrosome protein important for microtubule organization in mammalian cells 135 kDa centrosomal protein (CEP135) In the present study, we investigated a novel interaction between CEP135 and C-NAP1, two core centriolar proteins. Drosophila Bld10, the ortholog of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Bld10p and human Cep135, is a ubiquitous centriolar protein that also localizes to the spermatid basal body. M BLD10/CEP135 is a microtubule-associated protein that controls the formation of the flagellum central microtubule pair. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS6, SAS4/CPAP and BLD10/CEP135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. pericentriolar material proteins including pericentrin and CEP135. hereas Cep135 and CPAP formed a core structure within the proximal lumen of both parental and nascent centrioles .

56c1f00def6e39474100003f	Which enzyme is inhibited by Varespladib?	The VISTA-16 trial of varespladib, a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome was terminated prematurely owing to futility and a signal towards harm. Large-scale Phase III trials are now underway with agents that lead to marked reductions in IL-6 and C-reactive protein (such as canakinumab and methotrexate) as well as with agents that impact on diverse non-IL-6-dependent pathways (such as varespladib and darapladib).  The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes. The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS. The potential pro-atherogenic role of PLA(2) led to the development of two small molecules, varespladib, a reversible sPLA(2) inhibitor, and darapladib, a selective Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor.  In the present article, the enzymatic properties and the involvement of sPLA(2) and Lp-PLA(2) in atherogenesis are reviewed, with a focus on the results of experimental studies and clinical studies with both varespladib and darapladib inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: Several secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), including group IIA, III, V, and X, have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which led to the clinical testing of A-002 (varespladib), a broad sPLA2 inhibitor for the treatment of coronary artery disease.  Varespladib was able to inhibit sPLA2 in the types of neonatal lung injury investigated. sPLA2 activity was reduced in hyaline membrane disease (P &lt; .0001), infections (P = .003), and meconium aspiration (P = .04) using 40 µM varespladib; 10 µM was able to lower enzyme activity (P = .001), with an IC(50) of 87 µM Varespladib methyl is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized to varespladib, and both compounds are able to potently inhibit the enzymes of the human secretory phospholipase groups IIa, V and X, which play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic disease and inflammation The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial at 362 academic and community hospitals in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, and North America of 5145 patients randomized within 96 hours of presentation of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to either varespladib (n = 2572) or placebo (n = 2573) with enrollment between June 1, 2010, and March 7, 2012 (study termination on March 9, 2012).INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive varespladib (500 mg) or placebo daily for 16 weeks, in addition to atorvastatin and other established therapies.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization at 16 weeks.  The composite secondary end point of cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke was observed in 107 patients (4.6%) in the varespladib group and 79 patients (3.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.82; P = .04).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with recent ACS, varespladib did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and significantly increased the risk of MI. The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130246. The central hypothesis of this study was that treatment with varespladib, a small-molecule inhibitor of sPLA(2) would reduce postprocedural release of cardiac biomarkers after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2007 and June 2009, 144 stable patients were randomized in a phase II trial to receive varespladib 500 mg PO BID or placebo 3 to 5 days before and for 5 days after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.  We evaluated whether endothelial function is attenuated after PCI and if inhibition of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity augments endothelial function and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in these patients.METHODS: In the sPLA2 Inhibition to Decrease Enzyme Release After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (SPIDER-PCI) study, patients undergoing elective PCI were randomized to receive Varespladib (Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Mateo, CA), an inhibitor of sPLA2, or placebo 3-5 days prior to PCI and for 5 days after PCI.  The present study evaluated the effects of sPLA2-IIA inhibition with varespladib acid in a novel mouse model, human apolipoprotein B (apoB)/human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)/human sPLA2-IIA triple transgenic mice (TTT) fed a Western-type diet.APPROACH AND RESULTS: sPLA2-IIA expression increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in TTT compared with human apoB/human CETP double transgenic mice (P<0.01). Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity. Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity.  Acute inhibition of sPLA2 activity with Varespladib does not affect endothelial or microvascular function after PCI. Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity. Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity. We aimed at investigating the effect of co-administration of surfactant and varespladib on sPLA2 activity. Alveolar macrophages were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then treated with either varespladib, surfactant, varespladib followed by surfactant or nothing.

533ba218fd9a95ea0d000007	What is the clinical indication of cardiac T1 mapping magnetic resonance?	More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods.  Recent T1 mapping techniques aim to overcome the limitations of late gadolinium enhancement to assess diffuse fibrosis. T1 mapping techniques performed both with and without contrast are enabling quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and myocardial infiltration. Noncontrast T1 mapping has high diagnostic accuracy for detecting cardiac AL amyloidosis, correlates well with markers of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and is potentially more sensitive for detecting early disease than LGE imaging. T1 mapping has been proposed as potentially valuable in the quantitative assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, but no studies to date have systematically evaluated its role in the differentiation of healthy myocardium from diffuse disease in a clinical setting.  This study demonstrates that native and post-contrast T1 values provide indexes with high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of normal and diffusely diseased myocardium. T1 values lengthened with greater LVMI and correlated with the degree of biopsy-quantified fibrosis. This may provide a useful clinical assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in the future. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping has been used to characterize myocardial diffuse fibrosis.  In HCM and DCM, noncontrast T1 mapping detects underlying disease processes beyond those assessed by LGE in relatively low-risk individuals.

53357ca0d6d3ac6a3400004b	Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug fostamatinib?	It outlines preclinical and early clinical experiences with the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) and discusses various options for further clinical development of this compound.  To assess the efficacy and safety of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that did not respond to biologic therapies.  The mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated antitumor activity in all types of lymphoma, the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the PKC-β inhibitor enzastaurin is being used as consolidation therapy after remission in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Fostamatinib, a Syk-kinase inhibitor, does not affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R788, an oral inhibitor of Syk, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. The Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) inhibits tumor growth in the Eμ- TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL by blocking antigen-dependent B-cell receptor signaling. We have now investigated whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of the leukemias that develop in the Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. We show that conditional ablation of the syk gene in dendritic cells (DCs) abrogates FcgammaR-mediated cross priming of diabetogenic T cells in RIP-mOVA mice, a situation phenocopied in wild-type RIP-mOVA mice treated with the selective Syk inhibitor R788. We investigated the ability of a small drug Syk inhibitor, R788, to protect mice against mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced local (intestine) and remote lung injury. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R406 is orally administered as the prodrug R788.  Inhibition of Syk with fostamatinib disodium has significant clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These data prompted a phase 1/2 clinical trial of fostamatinib disodium, the first clinically available oral Syk inhibitor, in patients with recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).  We examined the effect of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an oral prodrug of the selective Syk inhibitor R406, in nephrotoxic nephritis in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor prodrug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing fostamatinib, a prodrug of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R-406, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and B-cell lymphomas. In developmental toxicity studies with the Syk kinase inhibitor R788, a spectrum of findings, including renal agenesis, were observed. R788, a prodrug of active metabolite R406, has been shown to be an inhibitor of Syk kinase, active in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting potential activity in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  In collagen-induced arthritis, R788/R406, a novel and potent small molecule Syk inhibitor suppressed clinical arthritis, bone erosions, pannus formation, and synovitis.  Fostamatinib (R788) inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and has been in clinical trials involving both MTX inadequate responders (MTX-IRs) and biologic inadequate responders.  The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor.  TK inhibitors including spleen TK (fostamatinib) and Janus kinases (tofacitinib) inhibitors are two novel oral therapies that have demonstrated short-term good clinical responses in active rheumatoid arthritis patients with and inadequate responses to methotrexate or other traditional (non-biologic) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  Progress is also being made with orally active Syk inhibitors. One such inhibitor (fostamatinib) is currently in large-scale phase 3 trials, and there are others in clinical development. We have shown that R406, the active metabolite of the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest while decreasing downstream phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphoma PTLD lines in vitro. Effects of fostamatinib (R788), an oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on health-related quality of life in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: analyses of patient-reported outcomes from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, in healthy human subjects following single and multiple oral dosing in three phase I studies. Fostamatinib (R788) is an orally dosed prodrug designed to deliver the active metabolite R940406 (R406), a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Fostamatinib demonstrates rapid and extensive conversion to R406, an inhibitor of SYK. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor that successfully completed phase II clinical trials, also exhibits some undesirable side effects. Fostamatinib (R788) is a prodrug rapidly converted to its active metabolite on oral administration. This (known as R406) is a potent inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase, required for the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines.  The Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, proved superior to placebo in Phase II trials and is currently under Phase III investigation. T More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263).  Because inhibitors of SYK activity, such as fostamatinib, are in advanced clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, understanding the role of SYK in signalling via TLR4 is of immediate importance.  The search terms used were Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors, PCI-32765, GDC-0834, LFM-A13, AVL-101, AVL-292, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors, R343, R406, R112, R788, fostamatinib, BAY-61-3606, C-61, piceatannol, Lyn, imatinib, nilotinib, bafetinib, dasatinib, GDC-0834, PP2, SU6656 in conjunction with lymphoid malignancy, NHL, CLL, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of Syk activity by R788 in platelets prevents remote lung tissue damage after mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently, Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against autoimmune and allergic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), bronchial asthma and thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Syk becomes activated by external signals from the tissue microenvironment, and was targeted in a first clinical trial with R788 (fostamatinib), a relatively nonspecific Syk inhibitor. In vivo expansion of luciferase(+) donor Tcs in mice developing GvHD was reduced by treatment with the Syk inhibitor Fostamatinib, which led to increased survival and reduced histologically confirmed GvHD severity. Syk inhibition with fostamatinib leads to transitional B lymphocyte depletion. No oral biologic agents are available at this time but promising data is emerging for two drugs, tofacitinib and fostamatinib, inhibitors of JAK and Syk kinases, respectively.  Fostamatinib (R-788) is an orally bioavailable small molecule. It is the prodrug of R406, which is a potent Syk inhibitor.  The oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib attenuates inflammation and atherogenesis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice consuming a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 2 doses of the orally available SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for 16 weeks showed a dose-dependent reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size by up to 59±6% compared with the respective controls.

X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe neuromuscular disease of infancy caused by mutations of MTM1, which encodes the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, myotubularin As a gene for X linked MTM was recently identified in Xq28, we screened the obligatory carrier mothers for mutation. We found a 4 bp deletion in exon 4 of the MTM1 gene, X-linked Myotubular Myopathy has clearly shown the benefits to be gained from a multinational research consortium with a common interest in identifying and cloning the MTM1 gene. Myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is an X-linked disease, characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with pathological features suggesting an impairment in maturation of muscle fibres. The MTM1 gene encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase consensus. myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital muscular disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the MTM1 gene, We established a colony of dogs that harbor an X-linked MTM1 missense mutation.Muscle from affected male dogs exhibits reduction and altered localization of the MTM1 gene product, myotubularin, and provides a model analogous to X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare congenital myopathy, usually characterized by severe hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency at birth, in affected, male infants. The disease is causally associated with mutations in the MTM1 gene, coding for phosphatase myotubularin. Mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a well-defined subtype of human centronuclear myopathy. MTM1 gene sequencing revealed a unique exon 7 variant in all seven affected males, causing a nonconservative missense change, p.N155K, which haplotype data suggest derives from a recent founder in the local population. X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLMTM), also called myotubular myopathy, is a severe congenital myopathy characterized by generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth and the typical histological finding of centralization of myo-nuclei. It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding the 3-phosphoinositides phosphatase myotubularin. sequencing all MTM1 exons X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital disorder due to loss of function mutations in the MTM1 gene, encoding myotubularin, a phosphoinositide phosphatase thought to have a role in plasma membrane homeostasis and endocytosis. Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin 1 protein (MTM1) are usually associated with severe neonatal X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM). However, mutations in MTM1 have also been recognized as the underlying cause of "atypical" forms of XLMTM in newborn boys, female infants, female manifesting carriers and adult men. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a recessive disorder, is caused by mutations affecting the myotubulatin (MTM1) gene located on the X chromosome. Most of the affected males die in the early postnatal period whereas female carriers are usually asymptomatic. The authors present a patient with the most severe X-linked recessive type (XLMTM). The diagnosis was confirmed and further specified by genetic analysis, revealing a novel frameshift mutation (1314-1315insT) of the myotubularin-coding MTM1 gene. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. MTM1, the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), is mutated in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe genetic muscular disorder Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase that acts on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate [PI(3)P], a lipid implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking and autophagy. It is encoded by the MTM1 gene, which is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a muscular disorder characterized by generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness at birth leading to early death of most affected males. The entire coding sequence of the gene was screened in 10 XLMTM patients using this technique. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; OMIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disease caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene. Mutations in the MTM1 gene cause X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM310400). We screened 29 independant patients with XLMTM phenotype and four with centronuclear myopathy. 87% (21/24) of patients with known MTM1 mutations showed abnormal myotubularin levels, including some with missense mutations. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) characteristically causes severe or fatal muscle weakness in male infants. Mutations in the gene MTM1, encoding the protein myotubularin, can be identified in most families. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscular disease characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, leading in most cases to early postnatal death. The gene responsible for the disease, MTM1, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, named myotubularin, which is highly conserved throughout evolution. X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a muscle disorder usually affecting newborn males. In the majority of cases, muscle weakness and hypotonia lead to a rapid demise at neonatal age. The responsible MTM1 gene is located in proximal Xq28. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe congenital muscle disorder due to mutations in the MTM1 gene. X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres. The gene responsible, MTM1, was identified recently by positional cloning, and encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP). X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MTM1) is a severe neonatal disorder often causing perinatal death of the affected males. The responsible gene, designated MTM1, was localized to proximal Xq28 and recently isolated. The characterization of MTM1 allowed us to screen for causing mutations in three families, previously investigated by linkage analysis. Using exon amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism, and subsequent sequencing analysis, three new mutations and their mutational origin were characterized by analyzing 10 exons.

Members of the novel gene family Gasdermin (Gsdm) are exclusively expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner in the epithelium of skin and the gastrointestinal tract.  These results indicate that the mouse Gsdma and Gsdma3 genes share common function to regulate epithelial maintenance  Gasdermin (GSDM or GSDMA), expressed in the upper gastrointestinal tract but frequently silenced in gastric cancers (GCs), regulates apoptosis of the gastric epithelium. . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that gasdermins are expressed specifically in cells at advanced stages of differentiation in the upper epidermis, the differentiating inner root sheath and hair shaft and in the most mature sebocytes of the sebaceous gland and preputial, meibomium, ceruminous gland, and anal glands. This expression pattern suggests a role for gasdermins in differentiation of the epidermis and its appendages.	['epithelial cells']

56cae60f5795f9a73e00002b	Which polyQ tract protein is linked to Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2?	Ataxin-2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein first identified in humans as responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). The molecular basis of SCA2 is the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in Ataxin-2, encoding a Lsm domain that may bind RNA and a PAM2 motif that enables interaction with the poly (A) binding protein. In SCA2 brains, we found cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, microaggregates. Mice expressing ataxin-2 with Q58 showed progressive functional deficits accompanied by loss of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor and finally loss of Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2).  Our analysis provides valuable information on the evolution and domain structure of Ataxin-2 proteins. Proline-rich motifs that may mediate protein interactions are widespread in Ataxin-2 proteins, but expansion of polyglutamine tracts associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is present only in primates, as well as some insects. The expansion of a polyQ repeat within the ataxin-2 protein causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). However, neither the precise pathological mechanism nor the physiological functions of ataxin-2 are known.	['Ataxin 2']
56e0447a51531f7e3300000b	Which are the smallest known subviral pathogens of plants?	Since the discovery of non-coding, small, highly structured, satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and viroids as subviral pathogens of plants , have been of great interest to molecular biologists as possible living fossils of pre-cellular evolution in an RNA world. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants.  Viroids are plant subviral pathogens whose genomes are constituted by a single-stranded and covalently closed small RNA molecule that does not encode for any protein.  Viroids are small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules that cause several infectious plant diseases.  Viroids: petite RNA pathogens with distinguished talents. Subviral pathogens of plants: viroids and viroidlike satellite RNAs. Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses are not the smallest causative agents of infectious diseases. Single-stranded RNAs as small as 246 nucleotides exist in certain higher plants and cause more than a dozen crop diseases. These RNAs have been termed viroids. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids. Viroids, subviral pathogens of plants, are composed of a single-stranded circular RNA of 246-399 nucleotides. During 1970 and 1971, I discovered that a devastating disease of potato plants is not caused by a virus, as had been assumed, but by a new type of subviral pathogen, the viroid. Viroids are so small--one fiftieth of the size of the smallest viruses--that many scientists initially doubted their existence.  The database of the smallest known auto-replicable RNA species: viroids and viroid-like RNAs. Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the &apos;brotherhood&apos; of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs.  Replicating circular RNAs are independent plant pathogens known as viroids, or act to modulate the pathogenesis of plant and animal viruses as their satellite RNAs. The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming.	['Viroids']
56bb621fac7ad10019000009	What causes Katayama Fever?	The laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers is difficult because the number of excreted eggs is often very limited. Eosinophilia (sometimes exceeding 50%) is often present in patients with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), but may be limited or absent in late fibrotic manifestations of the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers The specific diagnosis of early schistosomiasis and Katayama fever relies essentially on serologic tests or preferably on PCR (if available).  BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infection. Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. In Africa, it predominantly manifests as urogenital disease, and the main infective agent is Schistosoma hematobium. His symptoms were caused by acute invasive schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of imported Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) as well as evolution and outcome under treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Katayama fever by Schistosoma egg detection and/or by seroconversion.  The best therapeutic approach to acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is still unsettled. Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. Acute schistosomiasis, called safari's fever in Africa and Katayama fever in Japan, is an immunoallergic reaction due to transcutaneous penetration of infective cercaria. [Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever)]. Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever): corticosteroid as adjunct therapy. Katayama fever or acute schistosomiasis probably occurs more commonly than is recorded. His symptoms were caused by acute invasive schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever. Three distinct syndromes caused by schistosomiasis have been described: cercarial dermatitis or swimmer's itch, acute schistosomiasis or Katayama fever, and chronic schistosomiasis.

52c7311903868f1b0600001d	How many different mutations have been associated with Muenke syndrome?	Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.  The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis.  The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.   Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred.  Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).

571366ba1174fb1755000005	How can the fetal Rhesus be determined with non-invasive testing?	Determination of fetal rhesus d status by maternal plasma DNA analysis. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of fetal RhD genotyping by analysis of cell-free fetal DNA(cffDNA) extracted from plasma samples of Rhesus (Rh) D-negative pregnant women by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Performing real-time PCR on cffDNA showed accurate, efficient and reliable results, allowing rapid and high throughput non invasive determination of fetal sex and RhD status in clinical samples Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal RhD by using free fetal DNA The aim of this study is to determine fetal RhD status in the Rh incompatible pregnancies with an non-invasive technique; free fetal DNA isolation from maternal circulation.  The detection of fetal RhD status by using a non-invasive method from maternal circulation was found to be possible. Assessing fetal RhD status non-invasively by using free fetal DNA in maternal blood will be cost-efficient, avoiding unnecessary indirect Coombs test and unnecessary Rhogam applications that is used in RH incompatible pregnancies. Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection. Non-invasive antenatal diagnosis of fetal rhesus status in an alloimmunised patient. Our subsequent investigations have shown that this elevation in fetal cell traffic may serve as an early marker for those pregnancies at risk for this disorder.A very recent exciting discovery has been that free extracellular fetal DNA can be detected in the plasma and serum of pregnant women, which may permit the rapid and accurate detection of uniquely fetal loci, such as the fetal rhesus D gene in rhesus D negative pregnant women. Fetal rhesus D (RhD) status determination using circulating cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma or serum is now recognized in Europe as a reliable and useful tool. NGS is now sufficiently sensitive to analyze circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood (cell-free fetal DNA, cffDNA), enabling applications such as non invasive diagnosis of fetal sex (and X-linked diseases), fetal rhesus among rhesus-negative women, trisomy and, in the near future, Mendelian mutations High throughput non-invasive determination of foetal Rhesus D status using automated extraction of cell-free foetal DNA in maternal plasma and mass spectrometry Non-invasive RNA-based determination of fetal Rhesus D type: a prospective study based on 96 pregnancies. BACKGROUND: Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders.  Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.  Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing by analysis of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is a rapidly evolving field. Current clinical applications include fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D determination, the diagnosis of some single gene disorders, and a highly accurate screening test for aneuploidies.

Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls. It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). The gene for glucocerebrosidase ( GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, is located in a gene-rich region on 1q21. β-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, also has an essential role in maintaining epidermal permeability function, by regulating the ratio of ceramides to glucosylceramides in the stratum corneum of the skin.

We studied two patients with type IV glycogen storage disease 37 and 91 months after liver transplantation and a third patient with lysosomal glucocerebrosidase deficiency (type 1 Gaucher's disease), in whom tissue glucocerebroside deposition had decreased 26 months after liver replacement, to determine whether the migration of cells from the allograft (microchimerism) could explain the improved metabolism of enzyme-deficient tissues in the recipient.

Medulloblastoma (MDB) is the most common malignant cerebellar tumor in children Medulloblastoma is a malignant cerebellar tumor seen primarily in the pediatric age group that has a known ability to metastasize extraneurally Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor which is thought to originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors (CGNPs) that fail to properly exit the cell cycle and differentiate. Medulloblastoma (MDB) is the most common malignant cerebellar tumor in children. Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain tumor, is thought to arise from deregulated proliferation of cerebellar granule precursor (CGP) cells. Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor and is thought to arise from genetic anomalies in developmental pathways required for the normal maturation of the cerebellar cortex, notably developmental pathways for granule cell progenitor (GCP) neurogenesis. Most adult brain tumors are supratentorial malignant gliomas, whereas the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor is the cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor (medulloblastoma).

5547a01cf35db75526000005	In which kingdom do microsporidia belong, according to their current classification scheme?	Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites. Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi.  Microsporidia are ubiquitous fungi with genomes that have undergone a strong reduction Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites.  Phylogenomics supports microsporidia as the earliest diverging clade of sequenced fungi. A combined analysis of thousands of gene trees supports a topology in which microsporidia is a sister group to all other sequenced fungi. Altogether, our data strongly support a scenario in which microsporidia is the earliest-diverging clade of sequenced fungi. Microsporidia are a large diverse group of intracellular parasites now considered as fungi. The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi. The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because of protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related to conventional Fungi, not Protozoa. The preponderance of evidence as to the origin of the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister group to it. In a subsequent analysis, we excluded the other Microsporidia from the analysis to look for relationships before the divergence of Microsporidia, and found that 43% of the microsporidial genes scored highest with fungal genes, and a higher mean LPI was found with Fungi than with other kingdoms, suggesting that Microsporidia is closely related to Fungi at the genomic level. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi.

52bf208003868f1b06000019	What is the inheritance pattern of Li–Fraumeni syndrome?	It therefore appears that the LFS phenotype has been conferred by an aberrant gene, showing a dominant pattern of inheritance, which may be acting to compromise normal p53 function rather than by a mutation in p53 itself. In addition, there seem to be predispositions to a wider range of different, but well-defined neoplasms: e.g., adenocarcinomatosis of the colon and the endometrium, or the Li-Fraumeni/SBLA syndrome. The latter shows a spectrum of sarcoma, brain tumours, breast cancer, leukaemias, lung and adenocortical cancer. The genes leading to these types of dominantly inherited predispositions appear to be the tentatively so-called tumour suppressor genes, for which the Rb gene serves as a model he Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disease whose hallmark is a predisposition to a wide range of cancers among members of a family.

514a51c2d24251bc0500005c	Which pituitary adenoma is common cause of infertility is women?	Prolactinoma is the most common secreting pituitary adenoma. It is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age and is common cause of infertility. Examination of the tissue excised by transsphenoidal excision of the mass showed a pituitary adenoma that stained strongly for FSH. RESULTS: Regular menses resumed soon after excision of the gonadotroph adenoma, followed by a spontaneous pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, multiple preovulatory follicles, and a persistently elevated serum estradiol concentration. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, occurring mostly in women and presenting most commonly with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Causes of hyperprolactinemia include physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic factors; pituitary adenoma is a common pathologic cause. Women may present with decreased libido, infertility, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and galactorrhea. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). Pregnancy in a woman with active acromegaly is very rare, because amenorrhea, due to hyperprolactinemia and disturbed pituitary gonadotropin secretion may cause infertility. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Results in 136 hyperprolactinaemic women who presented with infertility, amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and/or galactorrhoea are reported. There was radiographic evidence of pituitary microadenoma in 21 (15.4%) patients and 5 (3.7%) had macroadenoma. Patients with pituitary adenoma had a significantly higher (p less than 0.001) baseline serum prolactin level (182 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) than those with no adenoma (59.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml). All patients in the study were treated with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the patients with or without pituitary adenoma. Two hyperprolactinemic infertile women, one with and one without a pituitary adenoma, who were resistant to bromocriptine treatment, were treated orally with Hachimijiogan, a Chinese herbal medicine. Infertility caused by hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea may be complicated by pituitary adenoma.	['prolactinoma']
56b397a98525abca1e000003	What is the lipid droplet used for in the cell?	Eukaryotic cells store excess fatty acids as neutral lipids, predominantly triacylglycerols and sterol esters, in organelles termed lipid droplets (LDs) that bulge out from the endoplasmic reticulum.  Lipid droplets (LD) are spherical cellular inclusion devoted to lipids storage. Cells store fatty acids (FAs) as triacylglycerol and package them into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs).  Lipid droplets are found in all cell types Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous and physiologically active organelles regulating storage and mobilization of lipids in response to metabolic demands.  Lipids accumulate in spherical cellular inclusions called lipid droplets (LDs) whose sizes range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes.	['lipid storage and lipid mobilization']
56c58ceeb04e159d0e000004	What is the function of circular RNA?	Here we determine the structure of these novel transcripts, showing that they correspond to circular RNA molecules containing only exons in genomic order. Thousands of loci in the human and mouse genomes give rise to circular RNA transcripts; at many of these loci, the predominant RNA isoform is a circle. Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each gene were cell-type specific. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression program. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs.  For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. An unexpectedly large fraction of genes in metazoans (human, mouse, zebrafish, worm, fruit fly) express high levels of circularized RNAs containing canonical exons. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or 'piggyback' on signals used in alternative RNA processing. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases.  Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.

515db3d8298dcd4e51000015	What is the average diameter of intermediate filaments?	Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average diameter of 10 nm. Ultrastructurally, rhabdoid cells showed paranuclear aggregates and whorls of intermediate filaments with a 9-10 nm diameter. After removing IFs by calcination, electron microscopy revealed hollow silica nanotubes several micrometers long, with outer diameters of 35-55 nm and an average inner diameter of 10 nm (comparable to that of IFs) Intermediate filaments are filaments 10 nm in diameter that make up an important component of the cytoskeleton in most metazoan taxa. Neurofilaments (NFs) are essential cytoskeletal filaments that impart mechanical integrity to nerve cells. They are assembled from three distinct molecular mass proteins that bind to each other to form a 10-nm-diameter filamentous rod with sidearm extensions. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs showed that acidic keratins and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin vitro. Intermediate in diameter between microtubules and microfilaments, IFs constitute the third cytoskeletal filament system of metazoan cells. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a diameter of 100 Angstroms and a low-density core. Further, using cryo-transmission electron microscopy on native, fully hydrated, vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists, both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes, of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately 8 nm.

51680a6d298dcd4e51000063	What is the function of cryptochrome-1 in mouse?	Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland. The Cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel-running behavior and lack of rhythmic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double-mutant mice in constant darkness. Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (mPer1 and mPer2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (mCry1 and mCry2) genes. A mutation in the mPer2 gene leads to a gradual loss of circadian rhythmicity in mice kept in constant darkness (DD). Here we show that inactivation of the mCry2 gene in mPer2 mutant mice restores circadian rhythmicity and normal clock gene expression patterns. Thus, mCry2 can act as a nonallelic suppressor of mPer2, which points to direct or indirect interactions of PER2 and CRY2 proteins. In marked contrast, inactivation of mCry1 in mPer2 mutant mice does not restore circadian rhythmicity but instead results in complete behavioral arrhythmicity in DD, indicating different effects of mCry1 and mCry2 in the clock mechanism Cryptochrome 1 and 2 gene products act in the negative feedback loop and are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel running behaviour and absence of cyclic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mice in constant darkness. , when mCry-deficient mice are housed in normal light-dark cycles, a single non-circadian peak in neuronal activity can be detected in SCN slices prepared two hours after the beginning of the day. This light-induced increase in electric activity of the SCN suggests that deletion of the mCry genes converts the core oscillator in an hour-glass-like timekeeper and may explain why in normal day-night cycles mCry-deficient mice show apparently normal behaviour. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 act as essential components of the central and peripheral circadian clocks for generation of circadian rhythms in mammals cryptochrome-1 mRNA was found in DA cells, immunocytochemistry was extended to other components of the circadian clock machinery. This analysis showed that DA cells contain the most common clock-related proteins. Cryptochrome 1 and cryptochrome 2 proteins are core components of the mammalian circadian clock and mice mutated in both genes are arrhythmic. a domain in the extreme C terminus of BMAL1 that plays an essential role in the rhythmic control of E-box-mediated circadian transcription. Remarkably, the last 43 aa of BMAL1 are required for transcriptional activation, as well as for association with the circadian transcriptional repressor CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), depending on the coexistence of CLOCK protein. circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). CRY1 is a master regulator of circadian rhythm that regulates the extracellular calcification of MSCs. Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs. Cytoplasmic hnRNP D levels displayed a pattern that was reciprocal to the mcry1 oscillation. Knockdown of hnRNP D stabilized mcry1 mRNA and resulted in enhancement of the oscillation amplitude and a slight delay of the phase. Our results suggest that hnRNP D plays a role as a fine regulator contributing to the mcry1 mRNA turnover rate and the modulation of circadian rhythm. more than three mutations of conserved PER2 residues impaired not only binding to CRY1 but also subsequent nuclear translocation, although mutations of non-conserved residues did not affect interaction with CRY1. Thus, the conserved amino acid residues of 1179-1198 in PER2 are apparently responsible for binding to CRY1. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) are considered essential for generating circadian rhythms in mammals. The role of Cry1 and Cry2 in circadian rhythm expression and acute light-induced suppression of pineal melatonin was assessed using Cry1 and Cry2 double-deficient mice (Cry1(-/-) /Cry2(-/-) ) developed from the C3H strain that synthesizes melatonin. Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), an essential clock component, displays evening-time expression and serves as a strong repressor at morning-time elements (E box/E' box). A genetic complementation assay in Cry1(-/-):Cry2(-/-) cells revealed that substantial delay of Cry1 expression is required to restore circadian rhythmicity, and its prolonged delay slows circadian oscillation. Taken together, our data suggest that phase delay in Cry1 transcription is required for mammalian clock function. the 24-h mRNA rhythms of the following genes were suppressed in db/db mice compared with control mice: the clock genes period homolog 1/2 (Per1/2) and cryptochrome 1/2 (Cry1/2) and their target genes D site albumin promoter-binding protein (Dbp) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparg) in the aorta and mesenteric arteries; Dbp in the heart; Per1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Rev-erba), and Dbp in the kidney; and Per1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In mammals, circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are controlled by a central pacemaker, the SCN, and subordinated clocks throughout the body. On the molecular level, these clocks are based on transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of clock genes that regulate their own transcription. Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (Per1 and Per2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) genes. I The mammalian clock protein, cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), is degraded via the FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination pathway, suggesting that it is also likely to be targeted by the deubiquitination pathway. Here, we identified that USP2a, a circadian-controlled deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with CRY1 and enhances its protein stability via deubiquitination upon serum shock. Depletion of Usp2a by shRNA greatly enhances the ubiquitination of CRY1 and dampens the oscillation amplitude of the CRY1 protein during a circadian cycle. By stabilizing the CRY1 protein, USP2a represses the Per2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous Per2 gene expression. We also demonstrated that USP2a-dependent deubiquitination and stabilization of the CRY1 protein occur in the mouse liver. The mammalian circadian clock is composed of interlocking feedback loops. Cryptochrome is a central component in the core negative feedback loop, whereas Rev-Erbα, a member of the nuclear receptor family, is an essential component of the interlocking loop. By analyzing the Fbxl3 and Cryptochrome 1 double-mutant mice, we found that FBXL3 also regulates the amplitudes of E-box-driven gene expression. These two separate roles of FBXL3 in circadian feedback loops provide a mechanism that contributes to the period determination and robustness of the clock.

5540ca8a0083d1bf0e000003	Which intermediate filament (IF) protein can be used as a non-specific marker of the neuronal precursor cells of the subventricular zone?	Nestin is a unique intermediate filament protein. While it is robustly expressed in developing brain, postnatal expression is limited to the brain's subventricular zone (SVZ) nestin, a marker protein for precursor cells in the subventricular zone adult subventricular zone (SVZ) stem and progenitor cells express nestin the typical protein of neural progenitors, nestin the nonspecific precursor cell marker Nestin In the subventricular zone, this effect was exerted selectively on a precursor subpopulation expressing nestin but not neuronal or glial cell-specific proteins. Nestin is an intermediate filament protein expressed in neuroepithelial stem cells during development and it is later replaced by cell specific neuronal or glial filaments. The results indicate that administration of thyroid hormone and retinoic acid increases the expression of Ki67, a nuclear antigen associated with cell proliferation, and of nestin, a marker protein for precursor cells in the subventricular zone of adult male rats. Only a minority of stem cells expressed nestin, a marker for neural precursor cells. In addition, bone marrow transplantation promoted proliferation of ependymal and subependymal cells, identified by nestin (a neuroepithelial stem cell marker), within the ventricular zone and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ). The results indicate that administration of thyroid hormone and retinoic acid increases the expression of Ki67, a nuclear antigen associated with cell proliferation, and of nestin, a marker protein for precursor cells in the subventricular zone of adult male rats In all animals, 20-40% of the newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone expressed the neural progenitor cell markers Musashi1 or Nestin	['Nestin']
51585b28d24251bc0500008d	Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?	his defect does not appear in mouse models with mutations in Dnmt3a and Mthfr genes and, therefore, it is specific for the Dnmt1 gene and is suggestive of a role of DNMT1 in imprint resetting or maintenance in the male germ line. Specificity of Dnmt1 for methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites resides in its catalytic domain. We obtained evidence that some 5-methylcytosine residues in these single-stranded DNAs can stimulate de novo methylation of adjacent sites by murine DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase as effectively as 5-methylcytosine residues in double-stranded DNA stimulate maintenance methylation. We present in vitro evidence that the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not the maintenance enzyme DNMT1, are also redox-dependent DNA dehydroxymethylases. Direct comparison to met1 plants, deficient in maintenance methyltransferase MET1, showed higher sensitivity of ddm1 plants to NaCl. DNMT1, the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase in animals, helps to regulate gene expression, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Correct establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns at imprinted genes has been associated with placental function and regulation of embryonic/fetal development. Contributions of CTCF and DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B to Epstein-Barr virus restricted latency. Thus, differential expression of CTCF and DNMT1 and -3B is not critical for maintenance of restricted latency. Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DNMT1 to DNA replication foci, presumably through its unique hemi-methylated DNA-binding activity and interaction with DNMT1. It is generally accepted that DNA methyltransferases carry out specific and non-overlapping functions, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b being responsible for the establishment of methylation around the time of implantation and Dnmt1 ensuring that methylation is faithfully copied to daughter cells via what has come to be known as "maintenance methylation." A new model is emerging that takes into account a contribution of the de novo enzymes Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the maintenance of the DNA methylation. We propose here observations in support of the hypothesis that the maintenance of methylation and subsequent silencing of a handful of germ line genes requires Dnmt3b but not Dnmt1. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the methylation marks through cell division. However, the de novo methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, can also contribute to the maintenance of the methylation pattern. These new data support the notion that de novo DNMTs also have an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation and suggest that, in addition to acting as oncogenes, they also behave as tumor suppressors. Structural insight into maintenance methylation by mouse DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for the propagation of methylation patterns to the next generation via its preferential methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites in the genome; however, how Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns is not fully understood. Usp7 and Uhrf1 control ubiquitination and stability of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. In mammals Dnmt1 is the DNA methyltransferase chiefly responsible for maintaining genomic methylation patterns through DNA replication cycles, but how its maintenance activity is controlled is still not well understood. DMAP1 is a potent activator of DNMT1 methylation in vitro, suggesting that DMAP1 is a co-repressor that supports the maintenance and de novo action of DNMT1. A group of enzymes, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) tightly regulate both the initiation and maintenance of these methyl marks. Maintenance of DNA methylation depends on DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels, and is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). While DNMT3a is mostly involved in de novo methylation, DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase. We propose a new model that suggests that the maintenance of DNA methylation relies not only on the recognition of hemimethylated DNA by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) but also on the localization of the DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes to specific chromatin regions that contain methylated DNA. The maintenance methylase, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), is a prominent enzyme in the process that is linked to DNA replication and drives the heritable nature of epigenetic modifications. We have shown previously that these drugs selectively and rapidly induce degradation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 by a proteasomal pathway. Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). We and others have shown that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage, yet DNMT1's exact role in this process remains unclear. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. In the absence of a human pituitary tumor cell line, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the maintenance methyltransferase DNA methyltransferase (cytosine 5)-1 (Dnmt1) was used in the murine pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20. We found that DNA methylation was maintained only when exogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) were added to the reaction. We examined the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, representative of a maintenance and de novo methyltransferase respectively, in response to in-vitro depolarization of cortical neurons, using standard techniques such as high potassium (KCl) or the sodium channel agonist veratridine. DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) has a higher specific activity on hemimethylated DNA than on unmethylated DNA, but this preference is too small to explain the faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. New genetic studies in plants and mammals have identified a novel factor that increases the fidelity of maintenance methylation. Dnmt1 is the main maintenance methyltransferase in the mouse and its expression is regulated by a splicing mechanism that dictates the expression of stage-specific isoforms. Phosphorylation of serine-515 activates the Mammalian maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1. DNA methyltransferase 1 methylates hemi-methylated CG sites generated during DNA replication. DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including the maintenance enzyme DNMT 1 and de novo methyltransferases DNMT 3a and DNMT 3b. Our data suggest that DNMT1 might be essential for maintenance of DNA methylation, proliferation, and survival of cancer cells. Maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Met1) and silencing of CpG-methylated foreign DNA in Volvox carteri. DNA methylation plays an important role in the gene-silencing network of higher eukaryotes. We have analyzed the 21.5-kb maintenance methyltransferase (M-MTase) gene, met1, of the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri. DNA damage-induced down-regulation of human Cdc25C and Cdc2 is mediated by cooperation between p53 and maintenance DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1. Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance enzyme DNMT1. DNA methylation, the major form of epigenetic modifications, is catalyzed by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and/or the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites by the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is the molecular basis of the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns. The allosteric site(s) on Dnmt1 can regulate processes of de novo and maintenance DNA methylation in cells. Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome. Maintenance of genomic methylation patterns is mediated primarily by DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). In this study, we showed that DNMT1, which encodes a methylation maintenance enzyme, is a transcriptional target of BRCA1. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are essential for maintenance of aberrant methylation in cancer cells and play important roles in the development of cancers. DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1) is involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns and is crucial for normal mammalian development. DNMT1, which is important for maintenance of methylation, increased across development and stayed high in adult cortex. Our results indicate that DNMT1 plays the main role in maintenance of methylation of CXCR4 promoter, while DNMT3B may function as an accessory DNA methyltransferase to modulate CXCR4 expression in AsPC1 cells. DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained by three DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. According to their structure and functions, DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) are divided into two major families in mammalian cells: maintenance methyltransferase (Dnmt1) and de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L). The 5-LOX DNA methylation increased with the age of the cells.	['DNMT1', 'MET1']

56d1f790f22319765a000001	Which gene harbors the mutation T790M?	Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20.  Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse.  Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M. However, resistance to the EGFR TKIs develops mostly secondary to T790M mutation in exon 20.  The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the threonine(790)-methionine(790) (T790M) point mutation of EGFR kinase is one of the leading causes of acquired resistance to the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib Both AKT and MEK inhibition contributed to cell death independent of erlotinib in the T790M-containing H1975 and the EGFR-WT cell lines tested.  The EGFR T790M mutation is generally considered to be the molecular genetic basis of acquired TKI resistance Prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI: poorer prognosis associated with T790M-negative status and leptomeningeal metastases. In EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines with the acquired resistance threonine-to-methionine mutation in codon 790 (T790M) mutation,  To overcome T790M-mediated acquired resistance of lung cancer cells to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), second generation  Approximately 50% of cases of acquired resistance (AR) are due to a secondary T790M mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene;	['EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor']
57138eb21174fb175500000a	Which is the protein implicated in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most frequent inherited cerebellar ataxia in Europe, the US and Japan, leading to disability and death through motor complications. Although the affected protein ataxin-3 is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding ataxin-3 Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiqutinating enzyme with important functions in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway and regulation of transcription. The C-terminus of the ataxin-3 protein contains a polyglutamine (PolyQ) region that, when mutationally expanded to over 52 glutamines, causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 Ataxin-3, the disease protein in the neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 or Machado Joseph disease, is a cysteine protease implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to the C-terminus exceeds a critical length Here, in studies of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. This pathogenic repeat in MJD/SCA3 encodes an expanded tract of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein, which is known as ataxin-3. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is caused by mutant ataxin-3 with a polyglutamine expansion.  Mutant ataxin-3 is aberrantly folded and proteolytically cleaved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The C-terminal region of the protein includes a polyglutamine stretch that is expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein.	['Ataxin-3']
513ce5f2bee46bd34c00000a	Which is the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the human population?	The allelic frequency of this variant was calculated to be 0.7% for this population The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98 The age related prevalence of CF among the South Asian and general populations was: 0-14 years, 1:9200 versus 1:6600; 15-24 years, 1:13,200 versus 1:7600; older than 25 years, 1:56,600 versus 1:12,400. A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. However, our data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants) CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening policies of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Jewish population.	['0.7–7/100000 inhabitants']

553656c4bc4f83e828000009	Which translocation is harbored in the Askin tumor cells?	The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors includes osseous Ewing sarcoma, extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin tumor. They share a karyotype abnormality with translocation involving chromosomes 11 and 22 Ewing tumor family consists of Ewing tumor of bone, extraosseous Ewing tumor, primitive neurectodermal tumor and Askin tumor. All of them share genetic abnormality, reciprocal translocation (11; 22) (q24; q12), and originate from the same primordial stem cell Chromosomal analysis of the neoplastic cells revealed translocation (11;22)(q24;q12), which is often found in Ewing's sarcoma and Askin tumor Malignant small cell tumor of the thoracopulmonary region (MSCT) was first described in 1979 and has been referred to as the Askin tumor MSCT and PPNET have a common reciprocal cytogenetic translocation [t(11;22)q(24;q12)], which is shared with Ewing's sarcoma The Askin tumor, a primitive malignant small-cell tumor of the chest wall, is mostly seen among children and adolescents.

56bdcc4cef6e394741000002	Which R/bioconductor package utilizes the Hilbert curve in order to visualize genomic data?	In many genomic studies, one works with genome-position-dependent data, e.g. ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq scores. Using conventional tools, it can be difficult to get a good feel for the data, especially the distribution of features. This article argues that the so-called Hilbert curve visualization can complement genome browsers and help to get further insights into the structure of one's data. This is demonstrated with examples from different use cases. An open-source application, called HilbertVis, is presented that allows the user to produce and interactively explore such plots.AVAILABILITY: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/huber-srv/hilbert/.	['HilbertVis']
56c1f01aef6e394741000043	What is targeted by monoclonal antibody Pembrolizumab?	gents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A).  Ipilimumab (CTLA-4) and pembrolizumab (PD-1) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma, and additional regulatory approvals are expected across the oncologic spectrum for a variety of other agents that target these pathways. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.  METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.  The anti programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been recently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  We describe for the first time the case of an adult patient who developed autoimmune diabetes likely as a consequence of PD-1 inhibition with pembrolizumab.  Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody and pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death 1 receptor may be a feasible treatment option in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma Pembrolizumab, a humanized highly selective IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on promising early-phase clinical data Anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 treatment with pembrolizumab in ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma: a randomised dose-comparison cohort of a phase 1 trial. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%).CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.  BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has shown potent antitumour activity at different doses and schedules in patients with melanoma. We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma.METHODS: In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged ?18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.  Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are targeted agents for patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody and pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death 1 receptor may be a feasible treatment option in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma. Pembrolizumab, a humanized highly selective IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on promising early-phase clinical data. Encouraging results have also been seen in other malignancies, and PD-1-targeted therapies are likely to markedly change the treatment landscape.	['programmed cell death 1']

53035d7c2059c6d71c000085	What is commotio cordis?	Commotio cordis is a rare type of blunt cardiac injury in which low impact chest trauma causes sudden cardiac arrest, usually occurs from being struck by a projectile during sports. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without structural damage of the heart and internal organs.  Although blunt, nonpenetrating chest blows causing sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis) are often associated with competitive sports, dangers implicit in such blows can extend into many other life activities.  Sudden death following blunt chest trauma is a frightening occurrence known as 'commotio cordis' or 'concussion of the heart'. Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without gross structural damage of the heart and internal organs.  Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease.  Nonpenetrating cardiac injuries due to direct precordial blunt impacts are a commonly encountered phenomenon in medicolegal offices. less commonly occurring manifestation of nonpenetrating injury is a concussion of the heart (commotio cordis), often with dramatic physiological consequences but no morphologic cardiac injury.

56bb68f9ac7ad1001900000b	What is the cause of Phthiriasis Palpebrarum?	Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. We report a case of unilateral phthiriasis palpebrarum with crab louse.  BACKGROUND: Pediculosis capitis is a common parasitic infestation, whereas phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon infection due to Phthirus pubis (pubic lice) inoculating the eyelashes and surrounding tissues of the eye.  Head lice typically do not infect the eyes, and given the different morphology of the lice on the patient's head and eyes, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made.  P. pubis can cause pruritic eyelid margins or unusual blepharoconjunctivitis. We present a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 4-year-old boy. INTRODUCTION: Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an ectoparasitosis in which Phthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. In all cases, the diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was confirmed by parasitological examination of eyelashes, which revealed the presence of adult and nit forms of Phthirus pubis.  Based on the observation of numerous nits at the base of the eyelashes and the ectoparasite in the palpebral margin, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made. Phthiriasis palpebrarum (lice infestation of palpabrae) is a rarely reported disorder and may present as blepharoconjuctivitis.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis. Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Phthirus pubis, is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis; therefore, this condition is easily misdiagnosed Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an unusual cause of blepharoconjunctivitis and may easily be overlooked because of the failure of physicians to recognize Phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an infestation of the eyelashes caused by the louse Pthirus pubis (Linnaeus, 1758).  Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Phthirus pubis, is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis; therefore, this condition is easily misdiagnosed. Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected.

Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an unusual cause of blepharoconjunctivitis and may easily be overlooked because of the failure of physicians to recognize Phthirus pubis.	['Pthirus pubis']
54f9ae2506d9727f76000002	Which gene is mutated in a subtype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy known as Naxos disease?	Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inheritable myocardial disorder associated with fibrofatty replacement of myocardium and ventricular arrhythmia. A subset of ARVC is categorized as Naxos disease, which is characterized by ARVC and a cutaneous disorder. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the Plakoglobin (Jup) gene, which encodes a major component of the desmosome and the adherens junction, had been identified in Naxos patients, although the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Loss-of-function mutation of Jup has been associated with Naxos disease, which is characterized by arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and the cutaneous disorder palmoplantar keratoderma. Previously, we have shown that genetic ablation of Jup in cardiomyocytes in mice leads to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy similar to Naxos disease in humans. As similar phenotypes have been described in Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome, respectively, the genes for plakoglobin (JUP) and desmoplakin (DSP) were screened for mutations using direct genomic sequencing.  One is a C-terminal mutation causing Naxos disease, a recessive syndrome of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and abnormal skin and hair. In this study, we examined the effects of two different mutations in plakoglobin on cell migration, stiffness, and adhesion Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. A recessive mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin has been shown to cause Naxos disease, a cardiocutaneous syndrome characterized by ARVC and abnormalities of hair and skin. Three other genes implicated for ARVC, plakoglobin (Naxos disease), desmoplakin (ARVC8) and plakophilin (ARVC9) have prompted the speculation that ARVC is primarily a disease of desmosomes. We tested the hypothesis that defective interactions between adhesion junctions and the cytoskeleton caused by the plakoglobin mutation in Naxos disease lead to remodeling of gap junctions and altered expression of the major gap junction protein, connexin43.  Naxos disease, a recessive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, is associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Naxos disease is caused by a mutation in plakoglobin, a protein that links cell-cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton. However, in Naxos disease, a recessive form of ARVC with coexpression of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, a mutation in the plakoglobin gene has recently been discovered, thus underscoring the potential role of genetic alterations in cytoskeletal proteins in ARVC. Naxos disease is a recessively inherited ARVC caused by a mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (cell adhesion protein) in which the cardiac phenotype is associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair.  Autosomal recessive ARVC caused by a mutation in plakoglobin was 100% penetrant by adolescence. Affected subjects who were homozygous experienced progressive disease with adverse prognosis. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Previously we mapped the genetic locus for the triad of autosomal recessive ARVC, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (Naxos disease) to chromosome 17q21, in which the gene for plakoglobin is encoded. This protein is a key component of desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is important for the tight adhesion of many cell types, including those in the heart and skin.

CMT4D disease is a severe autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy with extensive axonal loss leading to early disability, caused by mutations in the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) In a previous study, we have shown that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), classified in databases as a tumor suppressor and heavy metal-response protein, is mutated in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Lom (HMSNL), a severe autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1). The NDRG1 gene is located within this interval and NDRG1 mutations have been shown to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in humans (CMT4D). Genetic studies have revealed the following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for CMT2 (autosomal dominant axonal form); LMNA, GAN1, KCC3, TDP1, APTX, SETX for AR-CMT2 (autosomal recessive axonal form); GIB1 for CMTX (X-linked CMT); DNM2 for CMT-DI (autosomal dominant CMT with intermediate nerve conduction velocities); and DHH for minifascicular neuropathy. In a previous study, we have shown that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), classified in databases as a tumor suppressor and heavy metal-response protein, is mutated in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Lom (HMSNL), a severe autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Recently, human NDRG1 was identified as a gene responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D), which is characterized by early-onset peripheral neuropathy, leading to severe disability in adulthood. CMT4D disease is a severe autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy with extensive axonal loss leading to early disability, caused by mutations in the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1). The success of molecular genetic analysis in all families confirms that autosomal recessive forms of CMT caused by mutations on the NDRG1 and HK1 genes are common causes of inherited neuropathies among Slovak Roma.  Recently, human NDRG1 was identified as a gene responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D), which is characterized by early-onset peripheral neuropathy, leading to severe disability in adulthood.

In the primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2), at least 10 genes have been associated with these disorders; NEFL, KIF1B, MFN2, GAN1, LMNA, RAB7, GARS, TDP1, APTX, and SETX. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1). In the primary peripheral axonal neuropathies(CMT2), at least 8 genes have been associated with these disorders; the neurofilament light chain gene(NEFL), the kinesin 1B gene(KIF1B), the gigaxonin gene(GAN1), Lamin A/C(LMNA) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1(TDP1).  NDRG1 is an intracellular protein that is induced under a number of stress and pathological conditions, and it is thought to be associated with cell growth and differentiation. Recently, human NDRG1 was identified as a gene responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D), which is characterized by early-onset peripheral neuropathy, leading to severe disability in adulthood. Recent genetic studies have revealed their phenotypic and genetic diversities. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1). Recent genetic studies have revealed their phenotypic and genetic diversities. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1), at least 15 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage or point mutation of PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, EGR2, MTMR2, NDRG1, PRX, SOX10, GDAP1 and MTMR13/SBF2. Western blot analysis demonstrated an absence of NDRG1 protein in peripheral nerve biopsy of an affected Greyhound. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for polyneuropathy in Greyhounds and identified the first genetically characterized canine CMT model which offers an opportunity to gain further insights into the pathobiology and therapy of human NDRG1 associated CMT disease.

51bdd9c2047fa84d1d000002	Which is the receptor for substrates of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy?	These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor. CMA activity has been shown to be proportional to levels of the CMA receptor Lamp-2a. Lysosomes from livers of lipid-challenged mice had a marked decrease in the levels of the CMA receptor, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A, We report that Bcl-2-related early rod apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of autophagy markers including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) substrate receptor LAMP-2 we examined gene expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane 2 (LAMP-2), a CMA receptor The lysosomal-membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) acts as the receptor for the substrates of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective type of autophagy by which specific cytosolic proteins are sent to lysosomes for degradation. Substrate proteins bind to the lysosomal membrane through the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), one of the three splice variants of the lamp2 gene, and this binding is limiting for their degradation via CMA. Substrate proteins only bind to monomeric LAMP-2A, while the efficient translocation of substrates requires the formation of a particular high-molecular-weight LAMP-2A complex We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA In this study, we found that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for CMA, We have previously described an age-related decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy, by which particular cytosolic proteins are delivered to lysosomes after binding to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), a receptor for this pathway. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective pathway for the degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. CMA declines with age because of a decrease in the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) type 2A, a lysosomal receptor for this pathway. Oxidation-induced activation of CMA correlates with higher levels of several components of the lysosomal translocation complex, but in particular of the lumenal chaperone, required for substrate uptake, and of the lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a, previously identified as a receptor for this pathway. We now demonstrate that this protease activity triggers the degradation of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a), a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). We have previously identified this receptor as the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a) Lamp2a acts as a receptor in the lysosomal membrane for substrate proteins of chaperone-mediated autophagy. These characteristics may be important for lamp2a to act as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy. A progressive age-related decrease in the levels of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a that acts as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy Hsc70 and Hsp40 are members of a molecular chaperone complex required for protein transport into the lysosome during chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Once there, substrate proteins bind to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2 isoform A (LAMP2A), inducing assembly of this receptor protein into a higher molecular weight protein complex that is used by the substrate proteins to reach the lysosomal lumen.  Protein substrates bind to a receptor in the lysosomal membrane, the lysosome-associated membrane protein (lamp) type 2a.	['LAMP2A', 'Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform A']
52f509512059c6d71c000020	What is the mode of inheritance of short QT syndrome?	Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested.  From 1993, the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) came to our attention, as a new inherited "electrical disease" associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. Mutations of Ikr, Iks, Ikl channels cause dysfunctional Iks, Ikr, Ikl channels with an increase in the net outward K current leading to shortening of repolarization. This in turn leads to a shorter QT interval on the ECG and shorter atrial and ventricular refractory periods with increased susceptibility to VF and AF. There seems to be an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.	['autosomal dominant mode of inheritance']

56c83f365795f9a73e000011	Which domain allowing self-association do exist in TDP-43 and FUS proteins?	Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules. Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. Approximately 1% of human proteins harbor a prion-like domain (PrLD) of similar low complexity sequence and amino acid composition to domains that drive prionogenesis of yeast proteins like Sup35. PrLDs are over-represented in human RNA-binding proteins and mediate phase transitions underpinning RNP granule assembly. This modality renders PrLDs prone to misfold into conformers that accrue in pathological inclusions that characterize various fatal neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which rank 1st and 10th among RRM-bearing prion candidates, form cytoplasmic inclusions in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS cause familial ALS.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, that harbor prion-like domains, cause some forms of ALS. two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins. Mutations in related RNA-binding proteins TDP-43, FUS/TLS and TAF15 have been connected to ALS. These three proteins share several features, including the presence of a bioinformatics-predicted prion domain, aggregation-prone nature in vitro and in vivo and toxic effects when expressed in multiple model systems. Moreover, two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins TDP-43 and FUS and several related RNA-binding proteins harbor aggregation-promoting prion-like domains that allow them to rapidly self-associate. Molecular cloning of subunit 4 of the complex revealed that it is a proteasome-COP9 complex-eIF3 domain protein encoded by a gene that maps to chromosome 5, near the chromosomal location of the cop8 and fus4 mutations.  Deletions in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 that preclude interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 abolish TDP-43-dependent rescue of CGG repeat toxicity. The rescue appears specific to TDP-43, as co-expression of another ALS-associated RNA-binding protein, FUS, exacerbates the toxic effects of CGG repeats Recently, through Next-Generation Exome sequencing approaches a mutation resulting in a substitution (p.Q290X) in the nuclear export domain of the FUS protein was nominated as a cause of autosomal dominant essential tremor (ET) in a large kindred TDP-43 is another RNA-binding protein implicated in ALS We also provide multiple independent lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence that EWSR1 has similar properties as TDP-43, FUS and TAF15, including aggregation-prone behavior in vitro and ability to confer neurodegeneration in Drosophila. For TDP-43, both the RRM1 and the C-terminal glycine-rich domain are required for SG localization. Furthermore, TDP-43 and FUS display distinct domain requirements in aggregate formation and cytotoxicity. Binding was mediated by an unstructured TDP-43 C-terminal domain and occurred within the context of a 300-400-kDa complex that also contained C-terminal cleavage products of TDP-43 linked to neuropathology. It was recently found that dominant mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding domain protein) and FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma) cause a subset of ALS.

550f0e4c6a8cde6b72000003	Which disease is associated with the ectopic expression of the protein encoded by the gene DUX4?	e expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. These results indicate that molecular markers of the disease are already expressed during fetal life, thus opening a new field of investigation for mechanisms leading to FSHD. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat. DUX4, the primary candidate for FSHD pathogenesis, is upregulated over ten-fold in FSHD myoblasts and myotubes with short telomeres, and its expression is inversely proportional to telomere length. FSHD may be the first known human disease in which TPE contributes to age-related phenotype. Upregulation of the DUX4 retrogene from the last D4Z4 repeated unit is thought to underlie FSHD pathophysiology. However, no one knows what triggers muscle defect and when alteration arises.  Recent studies have provided a plausible disease mechanism for FSHD in which FSHD results from inappropriate expression of the germline transcription factor DUX4. Recent studies have proposed that FSHD pathology is caused by the misexpression of the DUX4 (double homeobox 4) gene resulting in production of a pathogenic protein, DUX4-FL, which has been detected in FSHD, but not in unaffected control myogenic cells and muscle tissue. DUX4, a homeobox-containing gene present in a tandem array, is implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a dominant autosomal disease. Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHD) is a dominantly inherited progressive myopathy associated with aberrant production of the transcription factor, Double Homeobox Protein 4 (DUX4).  A DUX4 transcript derived from the last repeat unit in a contracted array is associated with pathogenesis but it is unclear how. DUX4's pathogenic effect in FSHD may occur transiently at or before the stage of myoblast formation to establish a cascade of gene dysregulation. This contrasts with the current emphasis on toxic effects of experimentally upregulated DUX4 expression at the myoblast or myotube stages Double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a candidate disease gene for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common muscular dystrophies characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration.  In FSHD, the combination of inefficient chromatin silencing of the D4Z4 repeat and polymorphisms on the FSHD-permissive alleles that stabilize the DUX4 mRNAs emanating from the repeat result in inappropriate DUX4 protein expression in muscle cells.  In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, recent findings implicate a stabilized DUX4 transcript within the contracted D4Z4 repeats, opening the door for an RNA interference treatment strategy.   Aberrant expression of DUX4 from the last unit of the D4Z4 array has been proposed to be the cause of FSHD.  Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) was proposed to be part of the disease mechanisms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is caused by contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4 to a size of 1-10 units. The residual number of D4Z4 units inversely correlates with clinical severity, but significant clinical variability exists. Each unit contains a copy of the DUX4 retrogene.  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has been genetically linked to reduced numbers (≤ 8) of D4Z4 repeats at 4q35 combined with 4A(159/161/168) DUX4 polyadenylation signal haplotype. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent adult muscular dystrophies. We mainly focus on DUX4 isoform expression because the expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. Facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy (FSHD) results from deletions in the subtelomeric macrosatellite D4Z4 array on the 4q35 region. Upregulation of the DUX4 retrogene from the last D4Z4 repeated unit is thought to underlie FSHD pathophysiology. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. DUX4, a homeobox-containing gene present in a tandem array, is implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a dominant autosomal disease.  Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHD) is a dominantly inherited progressive myopathy associated with aberrant production of the transcription factor, Double Homeobox Protein 4 (DUX4). The expression of DUX4 depends on an open chromatin conformation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and a specific haplotype on chromosome 4. Even when these requirements are met, DUX4 transcripts and protein are only detectable in a subset of cells indicating that additional constraints govern DUX4 production. Autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) has an unusual pathogenic mechanism. FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a dominant disease linked to contractions of the D4Z4 repeat array in 4q35. We have previously identified a double homeobox gene (DUX4) within each D4Z4 unit that encodes a transcription factor expressed in FSHD but not control myoblasts. DUX4 and its target genes contribute to the global dysregulation of gene expression observed in FSHD.  Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to contractions of the D4Z4 repeat array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. In addition, we showed that the double homeobox 4 gene (DUX4) that maps within the D4Z4 repeat unit was up-regulated in patient myoblasts at both mRNA and protein level. Our results suggest that up-regulation of both DUX4 and PITX1 in FSHD muscles may play critical roles in the molecular mechanisms of the disease. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle.

52bf217003868f1b0600001b	What can Nothobranchius furzeri be used as a model system for?	The short-lived annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri shows extremely short captive life span and accelerated expression of age markers, making it an interesting model system to investigate the effects of experimental manipulations on longevity and age-related pathologies. Owing to large differences in aging phenotypes in different lines, N. furzeri could represent a model system for studying the genetic control of life-history traits in natural populations. It is very close to the Japanese Medaka, and close to the pufferfishes and stickleback and might represent a very useful model for comparative genomics of aging. In the last three years, N. furzeri has moved from biological curiosity to a promising model system for drug validation.  This result identifies resveratrol as the first molecule which consistently retards aging in organisms as diverse as yeast, worm, fly and fish, but it also reveals the potential of this short-lived fish as an animal model for pharmacological research. Moreover, being related to stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the "pufferfishes" Takifugu and Tetraodon, and even more closely related to medaka (Oryzias latipes), it can greatly beneficiate from the recent development of genomic resources for these fish models and in the future become a complete model system for the aging research community. These fishes can become excellent models for aging studies. They can be employed to test the effects of experimental manipulation on aging at a pace comparable with that of Drosophila and to probe the effects of natural selection on the evolution of aging-related genes.

54f2228e64850a5854000002	Which is the mass-tag that reveal the ubiquitination of a lysine residue?	antibodies that recognize the Lys-ɛ-Gly-Gly (K-ɛ-GG) remnant produced by trypsin digestion of proteins having ubiquitinated lysine side chains have markedly improved the ability to enrich and detect endogenous ubiquitination sites by mass spectrometry (MS).  Recent publications have also highlighted the use of peptide-level immunoaffinity enrichment of K-GG modified peptides from whole cell lysates for global characterization of ubiquitination sites.  In this work, levels of lysine ubiquitination were quantitated using a structurally homologous label that is chemically similar to the diglycine (GlyGly) tag, which is left at the ubiquitination site upon trypsinolysis Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins resulted in the identification of five peptides containing ubiquitin (diglycine) modifications on eIF2Bε	['Lys-ɛ-Gly-Gly (K-ɛ-GG) is the remnant produced by trypsin digestion of proteins having ubiquitinated lysine side chains.']

52bf1d2e03868f1b0600000c	Which gene is associated with Muenke syndrome?	Abstract Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990s.  The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.  Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R)               ). The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.  The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene.   Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured. We report on a set of identical twins with a de novo C749G mutation in the FGFR3 gene codon 250 after a pregnancy complicated by prenatal exposure to Nortriptyline. Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730). The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred.  Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. We have used gene targeting to introduce the Muenke syndrome mu Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  To better define the clinical features of this syndrome, we initiated a study of the natural history of Muenke syndrome. To date, we have conducted a standardized evaluation of nine patients with a confirmed Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.  The patients were either placed into the "Muenke" group (n=11) or the "non-Muenke" control group (n=12) on the basis of a test for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene. P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).  In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.  Hypochondroplasia (HCH) and Muenke syndrome (MS) are caused by mutations on FGFR3 gene.	['Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3)']
56bc77a3ac7ad10019000015	RTS S AS01 vaccine was developed to prevent which disease?	This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972) assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses induced. Until now, only one candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 has shown modest protection in phase 3 trial in African infants.  Efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine with or without a booster dose in infants and children in Africa: final results of a phase 3, individually randomised, controlled trial. BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine during 18 months of follow-up have been published previously.  INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose.  WHO anticipates that the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine will be recommended for the 6-14 week age group for co-administration together with other vaccines as part of routine immunization programs in malaria endemic countries. Recent phase 3 trials with malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) in children has demonstrated modest efficacy against clinical and severe malaria. The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered phase III testing. The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 as a vaccine for malaria is being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial. Assessment of severe malaria in a multicenter, phase III, RTS, S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine trial: case definition, standardization of data collection and patient care. If the phase III results confirm the observations made during phase II testing, the RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccine, when broadly implemented and judiciously integrated with other malaria-prevention measures, would have a major public-health impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered Phase 3 testing. The RTS,S/AS01(E) candidate malaria vaccine is being developed for immunisation of infants in Africa through the expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria candidate vaccine is being developed for immunization of African infants through the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Of the multiple approaches that have been pursued, the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine candidate represents the most developed and clinically validated malaria vaccine formulation AS01 has been selected for the clinical development of several candidate vaccines including the RTS,S malaria vaccine and the subunit glycoprotein E varicella zoster vaccine (both currently in phase III) Safety and efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01E candidate malaria vaccine given with expanded-programme-on-immunisation vaccines: 19 month follow-up of a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial A randomized trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of AS01 and AS02 adjuvanted RTS,S malaria vaccine candidates in children in Gabon.

54cb9c94f693c3b16b000005	Which is the main regulatory molecule of SERCA2A function in the cardiac muscle?	SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban Phospholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca(2+) cycling with a significant role in heart failure. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation.  phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load. The ablation of a muscle-specific sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor, phospholamban, rescued the spectrum of phenotypes that resemble human heart failure. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function.

5519113b622b19434500000f	Which gene is responsible for the development of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?	The cause of MWS is a de novo mutation in the ZEB2 gene. zfhz1b is the causative gene for Mowat-Wilson syndrome, in which patients demonstrate developmental delay and Hirschsprung disease, as well as other anomalies. Intrahepatic biliary anomalies in a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome uncover a role for the zinc finger homeobox gene zfhx1b in vertebrate biliary development We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether zfhx1b has a role in vertebrate biliary development Comprehensive ZEB2 gene analysis for Mowat-Wilson syndrome in a North American cohort: a suggested approach to molecular diagnostics. A case of Mowat-Wilson syndrome caused by a truncating mutation within exon 8 of the ZEB2 gene All typical cases result from haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene, with over 100 distinct mutations now described. Approximately 80% of patients have a nonsense or frameshift mutation detectable by sequencing, with the rest having gross deletions necessitating a dosage sensitive assay. Six patients had deletions in the ZEB2 gene, including two novel partial gene deletions. This report, the first such analysis in North American patients, adds to the growing list of both novel pathogenic mutations associated with MWS, as well as other variants in the ZEB2 gene. In addition, we suggest an economical testing strategy. Nonsense mutations of the ZFHX1B gene in two Japanese girls with Mowat-Wilson syndrome Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly-mental retardation complex caused by mutations in the Zinc Finger Homeobox 1 B gene (ZFHX1B) According to the gene analysis using white blood cells, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X and Q433X, respectively. In conclusion, molecular genetic analysis of ZFHX1B is important for a definite diagnosis of MWS which has a wide phenotypic spectrum of congenital anomalies. A missense mutation in the ZFHX1B gene associated with an atypical Mowat-Wilson syndrome phenotype Mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of the ZFHX1B gene have been described as the underlying cause of this condition.

[1998: J Med Genet 35: 617-623] is specific for ZFHX1B mutations. Intrahepatic biliary anomalies in a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome uncover a role for the zinc finger homeobox gene zfhx1b in vertebrate biliary development. Haploinsufficiency of a gene termed ZFHX1B (also known as SIP1) on chromosome 2 is responsible for this condition, and clinical genetic testing for MWS recently became available Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a recently delineated autosomal dominant developmental anomaly, whereby heterozygous mutations in the ZFHX1B gene cause mental retardation, delayed motor development, epilepsy and a wide spectrum of clinically heterogeneous features, suggestive of neurocristopathies at the cephalic, cardiac and vagal levels zfhz1b is the causative gene for Mowat-Wilson syndrome, in which patients demonstrate developmental delay and Hirschsprung disease, as well as other anomalies.

5149f494d24251bc0500004c	Which medication should be administered when managing patients with suspected acute opioid overdose?	Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist).  Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression Naloxone hydrochloride, an injectable opioid antagonist which reverses the respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension associated with opioids, has long been used to treat opioid overdose.  Experts have suggested that, as part of a comprehensive overdose prevention strategy, naloxone should be provided to heroin users for peer administration after an overdose.  Patients who received naloxone for known or presumed opioid overdose were formally evaluated one hour later for multiple potential predictor variables.  Patients with presumed opioid overdose can be safely discharged one hour after naloxone administration To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min.  There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose.  To illustrate this problem, we report the case of a patient inappropriately treated with naloxone and the results of a retrospective review of the medical records of 15 consecutive patients with cancer treated with naloxone in the emergency department over a 5-month period.  Management of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid antagonists.   The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. Opioid overdose is rarely the primary cause of altered mental status in cancer patients receiving opioid therapy. The inappropriate administration of naloxone to reverse an abnormal mental status can cause severe withdrawal symptoms and pain. 	['naloxone']
56cdf3e55795f9a73e00003c	Which type of GTPases is required for amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1?	Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb mTORC1 promotes growth in response to the availability of nutrients, such as amino acids, which drive mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. How amino acid levels are communicated to mTORC1 is only recently coming to light by the discovery of a lysosome-based signaling system composed of Rags (Ras-related GTPases) and Ragulator v-ATPase, GATOR (GAP activity towards Rags), and folliculin (FLCN) complexes The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues. A key input is amino acids, which act through the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD) in order to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation The heterodimeric Rag GTPases localize mTORC1 to lysosomes by their amino-acid-dependent interaction with the lysosomal Ragulator complex. These new findings define the lysosome as a site of action for FLCN and indicate a critical role for FLCN in the amino acid-dependent activation of mTOR via its direct interaction with the RagA/B GTPases. We show that LRS directly binds to Rag GTPase, the mediator of amino acid signaling to mTORC1, in an amino acid-dependent manner and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPase to activate mTORC1. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases, which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP, the immediate activator The Rag GTPases interact with mTORC1 and signal amino acid sufficiency by promoting the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation Amino acids stimulate mTORC1 activation at the lysosome in a manner thought to be dependent on the Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), the Ragulator complex, and the vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase) Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome.  Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb.  These new findings define the lysosome as a site of action for FLCN and indicate a critical role for FLCN in the amino acid-dependent activation of mTOR via its direct interaction with the RagA/B GTPases. Interestingly, p62 colocalizes with Rags at the lysosomal compartment and is required for the interaction of mTOR with Rag GTPases in vivo and for translocation of the mTORC1 complex to the lysosome, a crucial step for mTOR activation. Our results indicate that FLCN is specifically required for the amino acid-stimulated recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes by Rag GTPases.  Mutation of LRS amino acid residues important for leucine binding renders the mTORC1 pathway insensitive to intracellular levels of amino acids. We show that LRS directly binds to Rag GTPase, the mediator of amino acid signaling to mTORC1, in an amino acid-dependent manner and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPase to activate mTORC1.

51724fca8ed59a060a000013	Which  is the execution time (complexity) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences	The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm, which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned. While this result is not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm, its complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches. If we use N, M and C to represent the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function of N and M when C = O(log(N + M)). When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm. The algorithm is based on fractional programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm.

5506c3e38e1671127b00000a	The small molecule SEA0400 is an inhibitor of which ion antiporter/exchanger?	The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional ion transporter that couples the translocation of Na(+) in one direction with that of Ca(2+) in the opposite direction. This system contributes to the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration via the forward mode (Ca(2+) efflux) or the reverse mode (Ca(2+) influx). Concerning the role of NCX in NO cytotoxicity, we have found, using the specific inhibitor of NCX 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), that NCX is involved in NO-induced cytotoxicity in cultured microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. SEA0400 (1 μM), a pharmacological inhibitor of NCX, significantly shortened the MAP duration (P < .01) and reduced dispersion (P < .05).  We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specific NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mice. The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. In view of the previous observation that NO stimulates the activity of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), this study examines the involvement of NCX in cytotoxicity. The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability.  The sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) is one of the transporters contributing to the control of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration by normally mediating net Ca(2+) efflux. However, the reverse mode of the NCX can cause intracellular Ca(2+) concentration overload, which exacerbates the myocardial tissue injury resulting from ischemia. Although the NCX inhibitor SEA0400 has been shown to therapeutically reduce myocardial injury, no in vivo technique exists to monitor intracellular Ca(2+) fluctuations produced by this drug. We examined the involvement of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in the automaticity of the pulmonary vein myocardium with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. We investigated the expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the functional role of NCX in retinal damage by using NCX1-heterozygous deficient mice (NCX1(+/-)) and SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy] phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline), a selective NCX inhibitor in vivo.  SEA0400 is a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger having equal potencies to suppress both the forward and reverse mode operation of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Involvement of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in ouabain-induced inotropy and arrhythmogenesis was examined with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. In right ventricular papillary muscle isolated from guinea-pig ventricle, 1 microM SEA0400, which specifically inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by 80%, reduced the ouabain (1 microM)-induced positive inotropy by 40%, but had no effect on the inotropy induced by 100 microM isobutyl methylxantine. The effects of SEA0400, a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), on Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) uptake and catecholamine (CA) release were examined in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that were loaded with Na(+) by treatment with ouabain and veratridine. SEA0400 inhibited Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake and CA release, with the IC(50) values of 40 and 100 nM, respectively. Given the potential clinical benefit of inhibiting Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity during myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R), pharmacological approaches have been pursued to both inhibit and clarify the importance of this exchanger. SEA0400 was reported to have a potent NCX selectivity. Thus, we examined the effect of SEA0400 on NCX currents and I/R induced intracellular Ca2+ overload in mouse ventricular myocytes using patch clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements. The results suggested that SEA0400 is a potent NCX inhibitor, which can protect mouse cardiac myocytes from Ca2+ overload during I/R injuries. The effect of SEA0400, a novel Na+-Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, on mechanical and electrophysiological parameters of coronary-perfused guinea-pig right ventricular tissue preparation was examined during no-flow ischemia and reperfusion. The Ca2+ overload by Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a critical mechanism in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We investigated protective effects of a novel selective inhibitor of NCX, SEA0400, on cardiac function and energy metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion. The cardioprotective effects of SEA0400, a novel Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, were examined in isolated guinea pig myocardial tissue and ventricular myocytes. The effects of a new, potent, and selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, SEA-0400 (SEA), on steady-state outward (forward exchange), inward (reverse exchange), and Ca(2+)/Ca(2+) transport exchange modes were studied in internally dialyzed squid giant axons from both the extra- and intracellular sides. Inhibition by SEA takes place preferentially from the intracellular side of the membrane. Using SEA0400, a potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), we examined whether NCX is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced disturbance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis followed by apoptosis in cultured rat microglia. Activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may contribute to Ca2+ overload during reperfusion after transient ischemia. We examined the effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a selective inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, on a canine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (myocardial stunning). SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline) has recently been described as a potent and selective inhibitor of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange in cardiac, neuronal, and renal preparations. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 were investigated on the cloned cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, NCX1.1, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to gain insight into its inhibitory mechanism. The effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a newly synthesized Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, on the NCX current and other membrane currents were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and compared with those of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy) phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). SEA0400 concentration-dependently inhibited the NCX current with a 10 fold higher potency than that of KB-R7943; 1 microM SEA0400 and 10 microM KB-R7943 inhibited the NCX current by more than 80%. KB-R7943, at 10 microM, inhibited the sodium current, L-type calcium current, delayed rectifier potassium current and inwardly rectifying potassium current by more than 50%, but SEA0400 (1 microM) had no significant effect on these currents. These results indicate that SEA0400 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of NCX, and would be a powerful tool for further studies on the role of NCX in the heart and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition. The effect of the newly synthesized compound 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was investigated and compared against that of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined. SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively. SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the Ca2+ channels, Na+ channels, K+ channels, norepinephrine transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and five enzymes. These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage.

553c9f96f32186855800000c	How are ultraconserved elements called when they form clusters?	We were wondering whether this approach could provide insights about utlraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). These elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes. Their molecular functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation remain enigmatic This 'winner-takes-all' pattern suggests that UCNEs of a GRB function in a highly cooperative manner. We propose that the multitude of interactions between UCNEs is the reason for their extreme sequence conservation UCNEbase--a database of ultraconserved non-coding elements and genomic regulatory blocks The majority of UCNEs are supposed to be transcriptional regulators of key developmental genes.

534eb34b288f4dae47000002	In which process Src, Cortactin and MT1-MMP are playing an essential role?	Further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that the levels of key modulators of invadopodium maturation, including c-Src kinase, cortactin, and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) decreased when cells were treated with 6-shogaol or pterostilbene.  These data suggest that the repression of these factors might affect the maturation of invadopodia, inhibiting the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that 6-shogaol and pterostilbene can inhibit invadopodium formation and MMP activity in highly invasive breast cancer cells. EcTI was shown to decrease the expression and disrupt the cellular organization of molecules involved in the formation and maturation of invadopodia, such as integrin β1, cortactin, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, membrane type 1 metalloprotease, and metalloproteinase-2. Moreover, gastric cancer cells treated with EcTI presented a significant decrease in intracellular phosphorylated Src and focal adhesion kinase, integrin-dependent cell signaling components. We show that Abl kinases are activated downstream of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and are required for cancer cell invasion and matrix degradation induced by SDF1α, serum growth factors, and activated Src kinase. Moreover, Abl kinases are readily detected at invadopodia assembly sites and their inhibition prevents the assembly of actin and cortactin into organized invadopodia structures. We show that active Abl kinases form complexes with membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a critical invadopodia component required for matrix degradation. We have dissected the stages of invadopodium assembly and maturation and show that invadopodia use cortactin phosphorylation as a master switch during these processes. In particular, cortactin phosphorylation was found to regulate cofilin and Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization. Cortactin phosphorylation is required to release this inhibition so cofilin can sever actin filaments to create barbed ends at invadopodia to support Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. After barbed end formation, cortactin is dephosphorylated, which blocks cofilin severing activity thereby stabilizing invadopodia. In this report we show that the expression of activated versions of Src, Cdc42 and Rac1, or a kinase-dead but open form of the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), induces primary rat aorta VSMCs to form extracellular matrix-degrading actin-rich protrusions that are morphologically similar to the invadopodia formed by highly invasive tumor cells. The matrix-degrading structures are enriched in known markers for invadopodia, including cortactin and tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin and contain the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MT1-MMP and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Invadopodia formation by Src was dependent on Cdc42, Rac, and ERK, but not on p38 MAPK. Invadopodia formation induced by kinase-dead PAK1 required Src and ERK activity and a direct interaction with the exchange factor PIX. Dynamic interactions of cortactin and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase at invadopodia Small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition established that organization of invadopodia structure requires cortactin, whereas protease inhibitor studies identified membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as the key invadopodial enzyme responsible for gelatin matrix degradation in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. The inhibition of invadopodial structure assembly by cortactin depletion resulted in a block of matrix degradation due to failure of invadopodia formation. Either protease inhibition or MT1-MMP siRNA depletion moderately decreased the formation of invadopodial structures that were identified as actin-cortactin accumulations at the ventral cell membrane adherent to matrix. Examination of cells at different time points as well as live-cell imaging revealed four distinct invadopodial stages: membrane cortactin aggregation at membranes adherent to matrix, MT1-MMP accumulation at the region of cortactin accumulation, matrix degradation at the invadopodia region, and subsequent cortactin dissociation from the area of continued MT1-MMP accumulation associated with foci of degraded matrix.

5710e131a5ed216440000001	In which yeast chromosome does the rDNA cluster reside?	Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles Condensation of a unique region of chromosome XVI and the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster from chromosome XII were also examined in budding yeast.

The sizes of the two chromosome XII homologues were very different: 2600 (L-type) and 1450 kb (S-type). The size variation was shown to be derived from size changes in the rDNA cluster region, which is present in chromosome XII, by digesting the chromosome with XhoI, whose cutting site is not present in a rDNA repeat unit, and hybridizing to rDNA probes. Apart from chromosome XII, which contains the 1-2 Mb rDNA cluster, chromosome IV is the longest S. cerevisiae chromosome.

56e2acfe51531f7e33000014	During which stage of the cell cycle is cohesin deposited on the yeast genome?	In the budding yeast, cohesin is loaded onto the chromosome during the late G1 phase, establishes sister chromatid cohesion concomitant with DNA replication, and dissociates by the telophase.  Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but the process of cohesion establishment during S-phase is still enigmatic. Instead, we find that cohesin stability increases at the time of S-phase in a reaction that can be uncoupled from DNA replication. By using "single-copy" derivatives of the 2-microm plasmid, we demonstrate that recruitment of cohesin at STB during S phase indeed translates into cohesion between plasmid molecules. In cells recovering from nocodazole-induced spindle depolymerization and G(2)/M arrest, cohesin-STB association can be established coincident with spindle restoration. This postreplication recruitment of cohesin is not functional in equipartitioning.  We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP chip) to produce a genome-wide description of cohesin binding to meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cohesin sites are highly conserved in meiosis and mitosis, suggesting that chromosomes share a common underlying structure during different developmental programs. Cohesin complex acts in the formation and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during and after S phase.  Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Sccl subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin. Four of these proteins, Scc1p, Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p, are subunits of a 'Cohesin' complex that binds chromosomes from late G1 until the onset of anaphase. It is necessary for the establishment of cohesion during DNA replication but not for its maintenance during G2 and M phases. Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats. In this review, we have discussed the life cycle of cohesin during both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions including the structure and architecture of cohesin complex, relevance of cohesin associated proteins, mechanism of cohesin loading onto the chromatin, cohesion establishment and the mechanism of cohesin disassembly during anaphase to separate the sister chromatids. Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, suggesting that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding. Cdc14 phosphatase induces rDNA condensation and resolves cohesin-independent cohesion during budding yeast anaphase. Cohesins are deposited by a conserved heterodimeric loading complex composed of the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but how the Scc2/Scc4 deposition complex regulates the spatiotemporal association of cohesin with chromosomes is not understood. We examined Scc2 chromatin association during the cell division cycle and found that the affinity of Scc2 for chromatin increases biphasically during the cell cycle, increasing first transiently in late G1 phase and then again later in G2/M.

517818508ed59a060a000035	Which is the neurodevelopmental disorder associated to mutations in the X- linked gene mecp2?	Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Rett syndrome is one of the most common causes of complex disability in girls. It is characterized by early neurological regression that severely affects motor, cognitive and communication skills, by autonomic dysfunction and often a seizure disorder. It is a monogenic X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder related to mutation in MECP2, which encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2. Recently, this syndrome has been associated with mutations of the MECP2 gene, a transcriptional repressor of still unknown target genes. Here we report a detailed mutational analysis of 62 patients from UK and Italian archives, representing the first comparative study among different populations and one of the largest number of cases so far analyzed. Out of the 365 cases, 315 had MECP2 gene mutations and 3 had de novo CDKL5 gene mutations. No patients had FOXG1 mutation. Mutations were detected in ≈ 70% of classic and ≈ 21% of variant RTT, respectively. Amongst MR cases, 2.1% carried MECP2 mutations. Mutations in the MECP2 gene were detected in 13 of the 20 (65 percent) RS patients. This multicenter investigation into the phenotypic correlates of MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome has provided a greater depth of understanding than hitherto available about the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with commonly occurring mutations Mutation screening revealed 31 different mutations in 68 patients and 12 non-pathogenic polymorphisms. In this study, the MECP2 sequences in 121 unrelated Chinese patients with classical or atypical RTT were screened for deletions and mutations. In all, we identified 45 different MECP2 mutations in 102 of these RTT patients. Mutations in MECP2 were found in about 55% We identified mutations in the MECP2 gene and documented the clinical manifestations in 65 Rett syndrome patients to characterize the genotype-phenotype spectrum. We searched for mutations by sequencing the MECP2 coding region in 45 sporadic cases (35 with classic RTT, eight with variant forms and two males) and in seven families with two or more affected females. Following our previous report of mutations in two families and eight sporadic cases, we here present 18 additional mutations. The responsible gene, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), was recently discovered. Here we explore the spectrum of phenotypes resulting from MECP2 mutations. Both nonsense (R168X and R255X) and missense (R106W and R306C) mutations have been found, with multiple recurrences. Mutations were identified in 44/55 (80%) unrelated classical sporadic and familial RTT patients, but only 1/5 (20%) sporadic cases with suggestive but non-diagnostic features of RTT Collectively, we tested 228 unrelated female patients with a diagnosis of possible (209) or classic (19) RTT and found MECP2 mutations in 83 (40%) of 209 and 16 (84%) of 19 of the patients, respectively. Thirty-two different mutations were identified (8 missense, 9 nonsense, 1 splice site, and 14 frameshifts), of which 12 are novel and 9 recurrent in unrelated patients. Mutations in MECP2 were identified from most of the patients with classical and variant RTT (25 of 27 cases) In our series, 19 different de novo MECP2 mutations, eight of which were previously unreported, were found in 35 out of 50 Rett girls (70%) Causative mutations in the MeCP2 gene were identified in 63% of patients, representing a total of 30 different mutations. Mutations were identified in 72% of patients with classical RTT and one third of atypical cases studied (8 of 25). We have identified 15 different MECP2 mutations in 26 of 30 Danish RTT patients.

56a8ee75a17756b72f000007	What is the link between Dax1 and Esrrb?	Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where "ERRE" represents "Esrrb-responsive element") of the promoter  We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where "ERRE" represents "Esrrb-responsive element") of the promoter.

HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression. Inhibition of Hsp90 upregulated the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp70-bound Nox2, 5 and promoted degradation. Conversely, inhibition of HSP90 significantly increased the expression of both VEGF and HGF mRNA, and induced HSP70 protein in PHH cultures in vitro.	['HSP70']
571f33bd0fd6f91b68000003	Which gene is responsible for the development of Sotos syndrome?	Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome characterized by excessive growth during childhood, macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and learning disability. This disorder is caused by mutations or deletions in NSD1 gene Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts for a majority of patients with SoS Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome. The NSD1 gene was recently found to be responsible for Sotos syndrome, and more than 150 patients with NSD1 alterations have been identified. Recently, deletions encompassing the nuclear receptor binding SET-Domain 1 (NSD1) gene have been described as the major cause of Japanese patients with the Sotos syndrome, whereas point mutations have been identified in the majority of European Sotos syndrome patients. Mutations in NSD1 are responsible for Sotos syndrome, but are not a frequent finding in other overgrowth phenotypes. Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. Two cases of Sotos syndrome with novel mutations of the NSD1 gene. Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors.  Clinical and genetic spectrum of 18 unrelated Korean patients with Sotos syndrome: frequent 5q35 microdeletion and identification of four novel NSD1 mutations. Craniofacial and oral features of Sotos syndrome: differences in patients with submicroscopic deletion and mutation of NSD1 gene. Prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a 1.07-Mb microdeletion at 5q35.2-q35.3 associated with NSD1 haploinsufficiency and Sotos syndrome. Autosomal dominant mutations and deletions of the nuclear receptor set domain gene (NSD1), which is located at chromosome 5q35, are responsible for most of the cases.  There are two types of mutations that cause NSD1 haploinsufficiency: mutations within the NSD1 gene (mutation type) and a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene (deletion type).  Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth associated with macrocephaly and delayed psychomotor development. Patients with Sotos syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving NSD1 or its point mutations. Mutations in NSD1 are responsible for Sotos syndrome, Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome. The NSD1 gene was recently found to be responsible for Sotos syndrome, and more than 150 patients with NSD1 alterations have been identified.

55200c606b348bb82c000013	Which clotting factor is inhibited by betrixaban?	Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.  Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150).  They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others).  Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.   These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO-14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG1,2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. The majority of the drugs in development belong to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors (the -xabans). These include betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, and LY517717. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban.  EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa.  Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, the direct thrombin antagonist dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are more predictable and convenient anticoagulants in comparison with warfarin, mainly because of the non-requirement of regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban.  Direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxiban, which has shown promising results for VTE prophylaxis and is being studied for VTE treatment, as well as apixaban and betrixaban, which are at earlier stages of clinical validation. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation.  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. [Pharmacologic and clinical characteristics of direct inhibitors of factor Xa: rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban]. Betrixaban is an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa) being developed for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion. Betrixaban is a new direct factor Xa inhibitor with distinct pharmacological characteristics, including a long half-life, minimal renal clearance and minimal hepatic metabolism. Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing include orally active direct factor II inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048), AZD0837)], parenteral direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodium), orally active direct factor X inhibitors [rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), apixaban, betrixaban, YM150, DU-176b, LY-517717, GW813893, TAK-442, PD 0348292] and new parenteral FXa inhibitors [idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux (biotinilated idraparinux; SSR 126517), ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins (ULMWH: AVE5026, RO-14)]. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Most are small synthetic molecules that target factor IIa (e.g., dabigatran etexilate, AZD-0837) or factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, DU176b, idrabiotaparinux).

Further investigations revealed a mutation c.203T>C in the gene encoding HGprt of all members, with substitution of leucine to proline at residue 68 (p.Leu68Pro) Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) is the result of mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the purine metabolic enzyme, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) Lesch-Nyhan disease and its attenuated variants are caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine recycling enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase The study of Lesch-Nyhan-diseased (LND) human brain is crucial for understanding how mutant hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) might lead to neuronal dysfunction. Since LND is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme HPRT, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) that carry this mutation are a precious source for delineating the consequences of HPRT deficiency and for developing new treatments Molecular characterization and structure analysis of HPRT in a Chinese patient with Lesch-Nyhan disease. An example is the isolation, by 6-thioguanine resistance, of cells deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase -- the same deficiency that characterizes human patients with the X-linked Lesch-Nyhan disease. Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). In this research we demonstrate a model for Lesch-Nyhan disease by mutating the HPRT1 gene in human ES cells using homologous recombination. Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by a mutation in the HPRT1 gene that triggers an overproduction of uric acid, causing gout-like symptoms and urinary stones, in addition to neurological disorders. Five independent mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene were identified in a partially HPRT deficient patient with gout and in four Lesch-Nyhan patients Many different mutations throughout the HPRT coding region of Lesch-Nyhan patients have been described, including single base substitutions, partial or entire gene deletions, gene insertions or endoduplication of exons De novo purine biosynthesis has been studied in lymphocyte cell lines established from Lesch-Nyhan patients deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), in in vitro differentiating erythroleukaemic cell lines cloned from cells charactistic of virus-induced murine leukaemia, and in mutant hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase An example is the isolation, by 6-thioguanine resistance, of cells deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase -- the same deficiency that characterizes human patients with the X-linked Lesch-Nyhan disease HGPRT structural gene mutation in Lesch-Nyhan-syndrome as indicated by antigenic activity and reversion of the enzyme deficiency.

Molecular basis of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency in a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Production of a model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mice. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism associated with a virtually complete deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT). Normally spliced HPRT mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in this patient, in control subjects, and in two Lesch Nyhan patient with splice mutations excluding exon 4 (patient B) and exon 8 (patient C) who had clinically a Lesch Nyhan disease phenotype. A minor amount of normally spliced HPRT mRNA was found in all the patients.  Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by lack of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. Mutations in HPRT1 gene show variability in type and location within the gene, and in certain patients the HPRT coding sequence is normal and the molecular defect cannot be found. HPRT gene point mutations in three gouty arthritis and one Lesch-Nyhan patient have been identified by peptide sequencing. Six gross gene rearrangements have been identified in Lesch-Nyhan HPRT genes. In two other mutants causing Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a portion of the HPRT gene was deleted, and RNA splicing was missing in both mutants. Five independent mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene were identified in a partially HPRT deficient patient with gout and in four Lesch-Nyhan patients. Normally spliced HPRT mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in this patient, in control subjects, and in two Lesch Nyhan patient with splice mutations excluding exon 4 (patient B) and exon 8 (patient C) who had clinically a Lesch Nyhan disease phenotype.

5171438a8ed59a060a000007	What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?	Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S). In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i.e. MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T). RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCR Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The germline mutation was detected because of the systematic genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, which is useful for genetic counseling of potential risk of HSCR and MTC in other family members. This family could be added to the small worldwide cohort of families with MEN2A/FMTC-HSCR. Germline mutations of the ret protooncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and a proportion of cases of HSCR. In this report, we describe a new kindred in which the MEN2 and HSCR phenotypes are associated with a single C620S point mutation at one of the cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the ret protooncogene. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene.	['Ret']

53189b05b166e2b80600001e	Which glands are subject to attack by lymphocytes in Sjogren's syndrome?	In Sjögren's syndrome the autoimmune response is directed against the exocrine glands, which, as histopathological hallmark of the disease, display persistent and progressive focal mononuclear cell infiltrates. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by clonal B cell attack of the exocrine glands and dysregulated expression of B cell-activating factor (BAFF). Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by exocrine dysfunction resulting from chronic autoimmune attack primarily against the lacrimal and/or salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells chronically attack the lachrymal and salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which an immunological attack against the salivary and lacrimal glands results, respectively, in severe dry mouth and dry eye diseases. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands are the primary target and their functional impairment comes as a result of immune attack of epithelial cells of the affected organs (autoimmune epithelitis). Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of exocrine function as a result of a chronic immune attack directed primarily against the salivary and lacrimal glands leading to xerostomia (dry mouth) and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the lived experiences of women with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune syndrome in which invading lymphocytes attack moisture-producing glands of the body. This syndrome, affecting 4 million Americans, involves extreme dryness of the eyes and mouth and other systemic complications such as fatigue and muscle and joint pain. NOD mice manifest many features of autoimmune exocrinopathy (Sjögren's syndrome), a disease generally characterized by a chronic, progressive immunological attack against the exocrine tissues of the salivary and lacrimal glands.

51542e44d24251bc05000081	Mutations in which gene determine response to both erlotinib and gefitinib?	Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are frequently observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have transformed therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and have proved superior to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for this patient group. Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are promising therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs. NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases. Patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and active EGFR mutation have a high response rate (60-70%) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with little immediate progression (primary resistance). Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. EGFR-TKI yields a long survival period in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with EGFR gene mutations, Efficacy of erlotinib was recognized in the cases in which disease control was obtained by initial treatment with gefitinib. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who carry epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations respond remarkably well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib, or erlotinib. lung adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib; The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated treatments with these drugs. These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to other EGFR-TKIs. The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this seemed to be the cause of drug resistance. Patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma exhibiting overexpression or mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor tend to respond better to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with adenocarcinoma and never smokers. Some common somatic mutations in EGFR, including deletion mutations in exon 19 and leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 858 (L858R) in exon 21, have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib, which are selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in lung adenocarcinomas that respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)(such as gefitinib or erlotinib)treatment of lung cancer harboring EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies. patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations who received CSF examinations during epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment (250 mg daily gefitinib or 150 mg daily erlotinib). The evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as gefitinib and erlotinib was first confirmed as the second-line treatment for non-selective patients with advanced NSCLC. patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, the first-line treatment with gefitinib had achieved a significant prolongation of progression-free survival compared with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in a few phase III trials, and became a new standard of care. Gefitinib is highly effective for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation even if their performance status is poor, although one should always pay careful attention to fatal interstitial lung disease. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), which are molecularly targeted drugs, and it has now become possible to select treatment methods by choosing from a number of anticancer drugs. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to have a very high cytoreductive effect on lung cancers that have EGFR gene mutations. EGFR gene mutations at kinase domain in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers led to development of the small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been found in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with good clinical response to gefitinib therapy. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.

55054f8af73303d458000002	Which bone protein is used in archaelogy for dating and species identification?	Collagen was extracted from modern and archaeological cod bones using a weak HCl solution and analysed for its sulphur isotopic composition by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) With the high sensitivity of current generation mass spectrometers, ZooMS provides a non-destructive and highly cost-effective method to characterise collagen peptides. Archaeological bones are usually dated by radiocarbon measurement of extracted collagen.  we describe three complementary preparative HPLC procedures suitable for separating and isolating single amino acids from bone collagen or hair keratin with minimal isotopic contamination.  Bulk bone collagen isotopic analysis of 11 skeletons of Iron Age and Roman date gave a typical C(3) terrestrial signal ( Comparison of liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS) and gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) for the determination of collagen amino acid δ13C values for palaeodietary and palaeoecological reconstruction. Although the primary focus was the compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen AAs, because of its growing application for palaeodietary and palaeoecological reconstruction, the results are relevant to any field where AA δ(13)C values are required.  In archaeological studies, the isotopic enrichment values of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen give a degree of information on dietary composition.  Liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurement of δ13C of amino acids in plant proteins. A new procedure for extraction of collagen from modern and archaeological bones for 14C dating. Bones are potentially the best age indicators in a stratigraphic study, because they are closely related to the layer in which they are found. Collagen is the most suitable fraction and is the material normally used in radiocarbon dating. The developed strategy permitted unprecedented biochemical analyses of bone-matrix proteins, including collagen modifications, using nearly nanoscale amounts of exceptionally homogenous bone tissue.  Amino acid delta13C analysis of hair proteins and bone collagen using liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry: paleodietary implications from intra-individual comparisons. We report a novel method for the chromatographic separation and measurement of stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) of individual amino acids in hair proteins and bone collagen using the LC-IsoLink system, which interfaces liquid chromatography (LC) with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Species identification by analysis of bone collagen using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Analysis of the collagen from 32 different mammal species identified a total of 92 peptide markers that could be used for species identification, for example, in processed food and animal feed. We used authentication tests developed for ancient DNA to evaluate claims by Asara et al. (Reports, 13 April 2007, p. 280) of collagen peptide sequences recovered from mastodon and Tyrannosaurus rex fossils Analysis of amino acid 13C abundance from human and faunal bone collagen using liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) isotope ratios were measured in bone collagen and dentine from human skeletons excavated from this site in order to establish a weaning curve in mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers. Mass spectrometric analysis of the stable carbon isotope composition (13C/12C or delta 13C) of bone collagen from human remains recovered at archaeological sites provides a direct chemical method for investigating dietary patterns of prehistoric human populations. Coupled with more traditional archaeological methods, stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen can significantly enhance reconstruction of dietary patterns of prehistoric humans.	['Collagen']
56f7c15a09dd18d46b000012	Which gene has been implicated in Majeed Syndrome?	Homozygous mutations in LPIN2 are responsible for the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (Majeed syndrome). The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families.  We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome.   genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause Majeed syndrome Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is caused by mutations in LPIN2 ittle is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. An S734L mutation in LPIN2 causes Majeed syndrome Little is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome.

550ea8f1b305b40c5c000005	Pridopidine has been tested for treatment of which disorder?	These effects of pridopidine may serve to strengthen the cortico-striatal communication and to improve motor control in Huntington's disease for which pridopidine is currently in development. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pridopidine in Huntington's disease. We examined the effects of 3 dosages of pridopidine, a dopamine-stabilizing compound, on motor function and other features of Huntington's disease, with additional evaluation of its safety and tolerability.  Although the primary analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect, the overall results suggest that pridopidine may improve motor function in Huntington's disease.  One-year safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 1-year safety profile of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that pridopidine (≤90 mg/day) is generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Huntington disease for up to 1 year. Pridopidine is being developed for the treatment of impaired motor function associated with Huntington's disease and belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopidines, which act as dopaminergic stabilizers.  There is so far neither cure nor approved disease-slowing therapy for HD, though recent clinical studies have shown a beneficial long-term effect of pridopidine in patients with HD.  Pridopidine for the treatment of motor function in patients with Huntington's disease (MermaiHD): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Pridopidine belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopaminergic stabilisers, and results from a small phase 2 study in patients with Huntington's disease suggested that this drug might improve voluntary motor function. We aimed to assess further the effects of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS: We undertook a 6 month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of pridopidine in the treatment of motor deficits in patients with Huntington's disease. INTERPRETATION: This study did not provide evidence of efficacy as measured by the mMS, but a potential effect of pridopidine on the motor phenotype of Huntington's disease merits further investigation. Pridopidine up to 90 mg per day was well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease.  Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern. The putative restoration of function in cortico-subcortical circuitry by pridopidine is likely to make it useful for ameliorating several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Huntington's disease. Efficacy and safety of the dopaminergic stabilizer Pridopidine (ACR16) in patients with Huntington's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine (ACR16) in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial, patients with HD received pridopidine (50 mg/d, n = 28) or placebo (n = 30).  CONCLUSIONS: Pridopidine shows promise as a treatment for some of the symptoms of HD.  Investigational drugs discussed include ALN-HTT (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc/Medtronic Inc), EPI-743 (Edison Pharmaceuticals Inc), LNK-754 (Link Medicine Corp) and pridopidine (NeuroSearch A/S).

56c079b1ef6e394741000022	Idarucizumab is an antidote of which drug?	With Idarucizumab and Andexanet Alfa, specific antidotes have been developed against both, direct thrombin inhibitors as well as direct Factor Xa inhibitors.  Three novel molecules (idarucizumab, andexanet, and PER977) may provide the most effective and safest way of reversal.  Idarucizumab Improves Outcome in Murine Brain Hemorrhage Related to Dabigatran. We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab.  Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality. BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial. INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing.  Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran.METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). .CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes.

5178d6be8ed59a060a000038	What is a popular mesaure of gene expression in RNA-seq experiments?	Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure.	['Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM)']
531dd4af267d7dd05300000d	Inhibition of which enzyme is mechanism of action of alisertib?	Inhibition of AURKA using an investigational small-molecule specific inhibitor, alisertib, decreased the HDM2 protein level and induced P53 transcriptional activity.  Preclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/efficacy relationships for alisertib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase. Alisertib (MLN8237) is an investigational inhibitor of Aurora A kinase (AAK). The spindle organization defects induced by alisertib have been used to develop a pharmacodynamic (PD) assay for Aurora A inhibition based on the percentage of mitotic cells with proper chromosomal alignment at the metaphase plate (% aligned spindles, abbreviated as AS).  Phase II study of alisertib, a selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, in relapsed and refractory aggressive B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We therefore designed a phase II study of alisertib, a selective AAK inhibitor, in patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In addition, we employed vMCF-7DRaf-1 cells that display high levels of endogenous cyclin-A and demonstrated that molecular targeting of Aurora-A by Alisertib reduces cyclin-A expression. Alisertib (MLN8237) an investigational agent suppresses Aurora A and B activity, inhibits proliferation, promotes endo-reduplication and induces apoptosis in T-NHL cell lines supporting its importance in PTCL treatment. Alisertib (MLN8237) an investigational agent that inhibits Aurora A Ser/Thr kinase has shown activity in PTCL patients. We further find that MLN8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo.  Phase II study of MLN8237 (alisertib), an investigational Aurora A kinase inhibitor, in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. This single-arm phase II study assessed single-agent efficacy and safety of the investigational AAK inhibitor MLN8237 (alisertib), in patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.  This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the investigational oral drug MLN8237 (alisertib), a small-molecule Aurora A kinase (AAK) inhibitor, in 87 adult patients with advanced solid tumors. This phase I study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MLN8237 (alisertib), an investigational, oral, selective AAK inhibitor, in 59 adults with advanced solid tumors.  Targeting Aurora A kinase activity with the investigational agent alisertib increases the efficacy of cytarabine through a FOXO-dependent mechanism. The investigational drug alisertib (MLN8237) is a novel Aurora A kinase inhibitor being studied in multiple Phase I and II studies.  Our collective data indicate that targeting Aurora A with alisertib represents a novel approach to increase the efficacy of ara-C that warrants further investigation. Characterization of Alisertib (MLN8237), an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of aurora A kinase using novel in vivo pharmacodynamic assays. Here, we describe preclinical characterization of alisertib (MLN8237), a selective AAK inhibitor, incorporating these novel pharmacodynamic assays. We investigated the selectivity of alisertib for AAK and ABK and studied the antitumor and antiproliferative activity of alisertib in vitro and in vivo. Alisertib inhibited AAK over ABK with a selectivity of more than 200-fold in cells and produced a dose-dependent decrease in bipolar and aligned chromosomes in the HCT-116 xenograft model, a phenotype consistent with AAK inhibition. Alisertib is a selective and potent inhibitor of AAK. 	['aurora kinase']

5148691bd24251bc0500002d	Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation?	Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation. Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase. These results suggest that JNK activation by H(2)O(2) plus PDTC resulted from the down-regulation of JNK phosphatases. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6 phosphatase. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. . We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1.	['JNK']

5318929fb166e2b80600001b	What is the Her2 status in Li-Fraumeni syndrome?	Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in HER2+ breast cancer patients Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %). As seen in this case, most breast cancers in patients with LFS exhibit a triple-positive phenotype (estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/HER2-positive).  Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.

Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whereas orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50  > 100 µm). PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, nonsteroidal, oral, inhibitor of androgen synthesis with greater specificity for 17,20-lyase than for 17α-hydroxylase. Based on these observations, potent agents targeting the AR axis were developed: 1) inhibitors of CYP17 (a key enzyme in the production of androgens), such as abiraterone and orteronel; 2) AR antagonists that bind to AR and impair AR activation, such as enzalutamide and ARN-509.  Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells.  Inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase by abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), providing a rationale for development of CYP17 inhibitors with increased specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and VT-464) that can potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids. Phase I/II trial of orteronel (TAK-700)--an investigational 17,20-lyase inhibitor--in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones.  Hence, some molecules target the androgen biosynthesis, as abiraterone acetate and orteronel, which are selective inhibitors of the enzyme CYP17. To achieve enhanced clinical benefits, new strategies are being explored that include selective inhibition of the C17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 and multi-targeting strategies that affect androgen synthesis and signalling at different points. Some of these strategies-including the drugs orteronel, VT-464 and galeterone--are supported by preclinical data and are being explored in the clinic. Besides further CYP17 inhibitors (Orteronel, Galeterone, VT-464 and CFG920), androgen receptor antagonists (ARN-509, ODM-201, AZD-3514 and EZN-4176) and vaccine Prostvac, more drug candidates with various mechanisms or new indications of launched drugs are currently under evaluation in different stages of clinical trials, including various kinase inhibitors and platinum complexes.  Effect of an investigational CYP17A1 inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on estrogen- and corticoid-synthesis pathways in hypophysectomized female rats and on the serum estradiol levels in female cynomolgus monkeys. Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, non-steroidal inhibitor of CYP17A1 with preferential inhibition of 17,20-lyase in NCI-H295 cells.  In summary, orteronel can suppress serum estradiol concentrations in hypophysectomized female rats and monkeys through selective inhibition of CYP17A1 activity, suggesting that orteronel might be effective for hormone-dependent breast cancers and estrogen-dependent diseases. Development and validation of an RP-HPLC method for the quantitation of Orteronel (TAK-700), a CYP17A1 enzyme inhibitor, in rat plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study. Targeting the adrenal gland in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case for orteronel, a selective CYP-17 17,20-lyase inhibitor. A new CYP17 inhibitor, with more selective inhibition of 17,20-lyase over 17α-hydroxylase, orteronel (TAK-700), is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in pre- and postchemotherapy CRPC.  Effect of a novel 17,20-lyase inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on androgen synthesis in male rats. Orteronel (TAK-700), 6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2-naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A--a key enzyme in the production of steroidal hormones--and is being developed as a therapy for PC.  Orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity in rats with an IC(50) of 1200 nM but did not inhibit 17α-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) activity in rats at concentrations up to 10 μM. Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor: effects on steroid synthesis in human and monkey adrenal cells and serum steroid levels in cynomolgus monkeys. Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is under development as a drug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quantified the inhibitory activity and specificity of orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by evaluating its effects on CYP17A1 enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkey adrenal cells and human adrenal tumor cells, and serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, and testosterone after oral dosing in castrated and intact male cynomolgus monkeys.  In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys.  Discovery of orteronel (TAK-700), a naphthylmethylimidazole derivative, as a highly selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor with potential utility in the treatment of prostate cancer. Orteronel (TAK-700), 6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2-naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A--a key enzyme in the production of steroidal hormones--and is being developed as a therapy for PC. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory activity of orteronel, in particular its specificity for androgen synthesis enzymes, in male rats--an androgen-synthesis model that largely reflects this pathway in humans. In terms of human CYP17A1 and human adrenal tumor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times more potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor cells, suggesting greater specificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities in humans vs monkeys. In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys.

54db5e24bcba1b1817000002	What is the disorder in which mutations in U4atac snRNA are detected?	Biallelic mutations of the human RNU4ATAC gene, which codes for the minor spliceosomal U4atac snRNA, cause the developmental disorder, MOPD I/TALS To date, nine separate mutations in RNU4ATAC have been identified in MOPD I patients. In this report, we establish a mechanistic basis for MOPD I disease and show that the inefficient splicing of genes containing U12-dependent introns in patient cells is due to defects in minor tri-snRNP formation, and the MOPD I-associated RNU4ATAC mutations can affect multiple facets of minor snRNA function. A homozygous mutation in RNU4ATAC as a cause of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I) with associated pigmentary disorder.

55149f156a8cde6b72000013	Which gene fusion is the result of the "philadelphia translocation" or the "philadelphia chromosome" mutation?	Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cytogenetic abnormality associated with poor outcome in adults. This preliminary study, in the absence of substantial evidence, reported the prevalence of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in ALL patients by RT-PCR in Pakistan. The Philadelphia chromosome and its corresponding fusion gene, BCR-ABL, is one of the best-known genetic abnormalities in hematological malignancies. Major BCR-ABL translocation is much more common in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minor BCR-ABL in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions.  The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation leading to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome resulting in BCR-ABL gene fusion is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the presence of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR/ABL gene fusion on the derivative chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.  Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transforming abilities. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic progenitors from some CML patients. The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. The translocation event creates on the Philadelphia chromosome a fusion between two genes: bcr and abl. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Using specific probes for the BCR and ABL genes, results of FISH showed a three-way variant Philadelphia translocation (9;22;21)(q34;q11;p12) with a BCR/ABL fusion residing on the der(22) and the 3BCR region translocated on the short arm of the derivative chromosome 21. We report a cytogenetic study of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who, while displaying a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting from a standard t(9;22) at diagnosis, during the chronic phase (CP) showed disappearance of the Ph and occurrence of new chromosome changes, including a marker probably arising from a translocation involving chromosome 17 and the Ph. In situ hybridization confirmed the cytogenetic appearance and demonstrated that the breakpoint on the Ph marker occurred below the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. BACKGROUND: The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. In the great majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome produces fusion DNA sequences consisting of the 5 part of the major breakpoint cluster region-1 (M-BCR-1) and the ABL protooncogene which encodes for the P210BCR-ABL phosphoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Unique fusion of bcr and c-abl genes in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Expression of the ABL-BCR fusion gene in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation	['The BCR/ABL gene fusion', 'ABL/BCR fusion']

530cf4fe960c95ad0c00000b	Which type of lung cancer is afatinib used for?	Afatinib is a novel irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family members EGFR, tyrosine kinase-type cell surface receptors HER2 and HER4. It shows preclinical efficacy in NSCLC with common EGFR-activating mutations and the T790M mutation typically associated with EGFR TKI resistance At present, only first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (erlotinib and gefitinib) are available for clinical use. Second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKIs, such as afatinib, are still in clinical trials. In current clinical practice, EGFR-TKI is the first-line treatment of choice for metastatic NSCLC patients with tumor EGFR mutation or as salvage therapy in NSCLC patients who received systemic chemotherapy previously Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program.

52e62bae98d0239505000015	What is the life expectancy of professional athletes in respect to the general population?	In conclusion, while regular physical activity increases life expectancy, it remains unclear if high-intensity sports activities further increase life expectancy. Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy. It appears that elite endurance (aerobic) athletes and mixed-sports (aerobic and anaerobic) athletes survive longer than the general population, as indicated by lower mortality and higher longevity. Lower cardiovascular disease mortality is likely the primary reason for their better survival rates. On the other hand, there are inconsistent results among studies of power (anaerobic) athletes.

56caea805795f9a73e00002c	Which protein interacts with the Ragulator-RAG GTPases to control mTOR activity?	Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR. Here, we identify the human 11-pass transmembrane protein SLC38A9 as a novel component of the Rag-Ragulator complex SLC38A9 localizes with Rag-Ragulator complex components on lysosomes and associates with Rag GTPases in an amino acid-sensitive and nucleotide binding state-dependent manner Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery.

52bf1d9e03868f1b06000010	To the ligand of which receptors does Denosumab (Prolia) bind?	Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. Treatment of AML cells with the clinically available RANKL Ab Denosumab resulted in enhanced NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity.  The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the "vicious cycle" of bone destruction induced by these cells. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. In the future, the armamentarium against osteoporotic fractures will likely be enriched by (1.) new bone anabolic substances such as antibodies directed against the endogenous inhibitors of bone formation sclerostin and dickkopf-1, PTH and PTHrp analogues, and possibly calcilytics; (2.) new inhibitors of bone resorption such as cathepsin K inhibitors which may suppress osteoclast function without impairing osteoclast viability and thus maintain bone formation by preserving the osteoclast-osteoblast crosstalk, and denosumab, an already widely available antibody against RANKL which inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival; and (3.) new therapeutic strategies based on an extended understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis which may include sequential therapies with two or more bone active substances aimed at optimising the management of bone capital acquired during adolescence and maintained during adulthood in terms of both quantity and quality.  Clearly, the approval of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL, has just marked the beginning of a new era for bone therapy with several additional new therapies lining up for clinical approval in the coming years. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months. More recently, a nuclear factor-β ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been             developed for the treatment of bone metastases. Denosumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to RANKL and has recently been found to inhibit SRE more effectively than BP.  Recently, denosumab, a noncytotoxic IgG2 monoclonal antibody with high affinity for human RANKL, has been demonstrated to significantly prevent clinically relevant increase in pain compared with zoledronic acid across the tumor types.  Denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody with proven antiosteoclast activity, may suppress immune responses.  We also review unresolved controversies surrounding the management of these conditions by administration of nutritional vitamin D (ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol), vitamin D receptor activators (calcitriol, alphacalcidiol, doxercalciferol), D-mimetics (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol), calcimimetics (cinacalcet), recombinant PTH (teriparatide), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand modulators (denosumab); compare mortality predictability of PTH and alkaline phosphatase; and examine potential risks of bone disorders and mineral disarrays in CKD patients. New therapies such as the antibody to RANKL (denosumab) are undergoing phase III clinical testing.  Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand is an important cytokine involved in osteoclast activation; denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to this molecule, has finished a major fracture trial.  Initials studies have demonstrated that targeting RANK/ RANKL signaling with the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab prevented skeletal complications in patients with MM and other cancers with bone metastases.  A highly specific, fully human antibody against RANKL has been produced (denosumab) that in early studies in humans reduces bone turnover and improves bone density. Denosumab (AMG 162), a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, shares the pharmacologic attributes of OPG but has a significantly longer half-life that allows less frequent administration.

56fcf1b8cf1c325851000005	Which type of genes are modulated by SATB1?	Repression of the genome organizer SATB1 in regulatory T cells is required for suppressive function and inhibition of effector differentiation SATB1, a genome organizer that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression, was crucial for the phenotype and function of T(reg) cells Foxp3, acting as a transcriptional repressor, directly suppressed the SATB1 locus and indirectly suppressed it through the induction of microRNAs that bound the SATB1 3' untranslated region. Release of SATB1 from the control of Foxp3 in T(reg) cells caused loss of suppressive function, establishment of transcriptional T(eff) cell programs and induction of T(eff) cell cytokines. Consistent with previous reports in a non-superantigen in vivo anergy model, mRNA for CD18 and the transcription factor Satb1 (special AT-rich-binding protein 1) was increased in SEB-energized T cells.

54f5bc7d5f206a0c06000001	What is the function of caspases?	Caspases are the ultimate executors of the apoptotic programmed cell death pathway. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases coordinate the morphological and biochemical events that typify apoptosis.  Caspase function is known to be essential for cell death by apoptosis, Caspases, initially identified as a family of proteases regulating cell death, have been found to have nonapoptotic functions as well. . As in other organisms, apoptosis is executed by caspases. Caspases are intracellular proteases that propagate programmed cell death, proliferation, and inflammation.  Apoptosis is dependent upon caspase activation leading to substrate cleavage and, ultimately, cell death. Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that constitute the effector arm of the apoptotic machinery. Caspases are critical mediators of apoptosis, the principle mechanism by which extra and harmful cells are eliminated to ensure proper development and maintain cellular homeostasis in all multicellular organisms.  Caspases (cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases) are at the core of the cell's suicide machinery. These enzymes, once activated, dismantle the cell by selectively cleaving key proteins after aspartate residues.  Programmed cell death plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis during animal development, and has been conserved in animals as different as nematodes and humans.

56d1e23c67f0cb3d66000009	Which are the coactivators of the Yes-associated protein (yap)?	ndependent research, often in the context of muscle biology, described Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors, which bind CATTCC DNA motifs to regulate gene expression. These two research areas were joined by the finding that the Hippo pathway regulates the activity of Tead transcription factors mainly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivators Yap and Taz, which bind to and activate Teads. TEADs on their own are unable to activate transcription and they require the help of coactivators. Several TEAD-interacting coactivators are known and they can be classified into three groups: (1) YAP and its paralog TAZ; YAP and TAZ are transcription coactivators and effectors of the Hippo pathway, which play a key role in organ size control. Through interaction with transcription factors such as TEADs, they activate gene transcription and thus promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate cell differentiation.  The YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex also upregulates several other proliferation-promoting genes and also promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation. hree-dimensional structure of the YAP-TEAD complex	['Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors.']
531af8cbb166e2b80600003a	How many genes outside of the MHC locus have been genetically associated to Rheumatoid Arthritis through GWAS?	Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have allowed the characterization of more than 40 new susceptibility genes and the confirmation of a marked differential genetic background between patients expressing anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA, approximately 80% of all RA patients) and ACPA negative RA patients Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC.  The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis. The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were significantly associated with RA (P<0.01) for the allele, dominant, and recessive models, respectively. This paper compares corresponding non-MHC genomic regions identified in rodent and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, over 30 non-MHC RA-associated loci have been identified in humans, and over 100 arthritis-associated loci have been identified in rodent models of RA Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci associated with RA, so the list is now over 30 Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles. Genome-wide association studies have expanded the number of validated RA risk loci beyond HLA-DRB1 "shared epitope" alleles to include additional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) risk alleles and more than 10 regions outside the MHC. We successfully identified 41 significant SNPs relevant to RA, 25 associated genes and a number of important SNP-SNP interactions (SNP patterns) A total of 47 candidate regions were identified.

514a0a57d24251bc05000051	Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?	Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is widely used as an antidote in comatose patients suspected of having ingested a benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of sedation from benzodiazepines administered during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and during induction or maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for benzodiazepine overdose. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. A 54-y-old man ingested 2 g of bulk laboratory diazepam and was treated with activated charcoal, enhanced diuresis and flumazenil infusion. Flumazenil is a specific and competitive antagonist at the central benzodiazepine receptor, reversing all effects of benzodiazepine agonists without tranquillising or anticonvulsant actions. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic conscious sedation has not been defined. To develop clinical rules for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Flumazenil is best left for reversal of therapeutic conscious sedation and rare select cases of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. It improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17 patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and 58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful in reversing the sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants. The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). The efficacy and safety of flumazenil were assessed in comparison to placebo in a double-blind randomised study of 31 adults intoxicated with benzodiazepines. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation, and orientation in time and space. Patients who received flumazenil awoke within minutes but central depression returned partly one hour later, which reflects the short elimination half-life of the drug. Side effects were few and the results indicate that flumazenil is effective in the primary management of benzodiazepine overdose and in states where benzodiazepines have been taken with other drugs. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of unknown origin.	['flumazenil']
53036faab24d855b11000001	What is the incidence of sudden cardiac death among young athletes?	Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. The incidence of SCD is expected at one case for each 200,000 young athletes per year. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young athletes is estimated to be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated.  Sudden cardiac death in a young athlete is a tragic and marking event, even though the media attention it gets is more important than its incidence (1-2/100000 per year).  The sudden death of athletes under 35 years engaged in competitive sports is a well-known occurrence; the incidence is higher in athletes (approximately 2/100,000 per year) than in non-athletes (2.5 : 1), and the cause is cardiovascular in over 90%.

52fb7c512059c6d71c000069	How much should be the duration of the QT interval in patients with short QT syndrome?	The short QT syndrome constitutes a new clinical entity that is associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death, syncope, and/or atrial fibrillation even in young patients and newborns. Patients with this congenital electrical abnormality are characterized by rate-corrected QT intervals<320 ms.  QT interval is shortened when QTc is less than 350 ms (1st degree of shortening). In children with QTc below 330 ms (2nd degree of shortening) short QT syndrome should be excluded. The short-QT syndrome is a new clinical entity characterized by corrected QT intervals <300 ms and a high incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF).  Short QT syndrome is a newly described cardiologic entity which associates a short OT interval (QT and QTc < or = 300 ms) on the surface ECG to a high risk of syncope or sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

56c58f1b5795f9a73e000001	Which species of bacteria did the mitochondria originate from?	Recently, α-proteobacteria have been shown to possess virus-like gene transfer agents that facilitate high frequency gene transfer in natural environments between distantly related lineages. This system could have driven the genomic integration of the mitochondrial progenitor and its proto-eukaryote host and contributed to the evolutionary mosaic of genes seen in modern-day prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Although the Alphaproteobacteria are thought to be the closest relatives of the mitochondrial progenitor, there is dispute as to what its particular sister group is. More detailed phylogenetic analyses with additional Alphaproteobacteria and including genes from the mitochondria of Reclinomonas americana found matches of mitochondrial genes to those of members of the Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, and Rhodospirillaceae families. Biologists agree that the ancestor of mitochondria was an alpha-proteobacterium. Mitochondria originated by permanent enslavement of purple non-sulphur bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses based on genes located in the mitochondrial genome indicate that these genes originated from within the alpha-proteobacteria. The strong relationship with alpha-proteobacterial genes observed for some mitochondrial genes, combined with the lack of such a relationship for others, indicates that the modern mitochondrial proteome is the product of both reductive and expansive processes. Accumulating evolutionary data point to a monophyletic origin of mitochondria from the order Rickettsiales. Evolutionary analyses of proteins encoded in the genome contain the strongest phylogenetic evidence to date for the view that mitochondria descend from alpha-proteobacteria. The functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes: no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either R. prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes, but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in R. prowazekii. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that R. prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far. The phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that mitochondria are derived from the alpha-proteobacteria and more specifically from within the Rickettsiaceae. We have estimated that the common ancestor of mitochondria and Rickettsiaceae dates back to more than 1500 million years ago. GOBASE also includes a fully reannotated genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii, one of the closest bacterial relatives of mitochondria, and will shortly expand to contain more data from bacteria from which organelles originated.

5547ec32f35db7552600000a	What is the effect induced by sympathetic nervous system on pupil size?	Pupil size is determined by the interaction of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system acts either directly on the dilator muscle (peripherally) or centrally by inhibiting the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. The mechanism of reflex pupillary dilation was investigated in eight patients who were declared brain dead after rupture of intracranial vascular malformations and in eight awake volunteers. The authors hypothesized that the reflex was primarily a spinal sympathetic reflex The authors conclude that pupillary reflex dilation, as it is clinically performed in awake subjects by stimulating somatic nociceptors, is a sympathetic reflex. Pupil size is determined by an interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nervous system activation, with reflex dilation of the pupil reproducibly larger pupil size--indicative of increased sympathetic arousal-- activation of autonomic sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracic spinal cord produces pupillary dilatation sympathetic responses (sweating, pupil dilatation, piloerection, etc.) In the absence of anesthesia, dilation is primarily mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Pupil size is determined by an interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nervous system activation, with reflex dilation of the pupil, was produced by noxious electrical stimulation during 4% and 8% end-tidal desflurane, and by a rapid 4%-to-8% step-up in the desflurane concentration. BACKGROUND: Pupil size is determined by an interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Dark-adapted pupil size after topical PNS blockade (an index of iris sympathetic nervous system [SNS] activity) was also smaller in both groups of diabetic subjects (NIDD, P less than 0.01; IDD, P less than 0.05). However, dark-adapted pupil size during parasympathetic nervous system blockade, an index of iris sympathetic nervous system activity, declined with age (r = -0.81, p less than 0.001).

52c7275103868f1b0600001c	What is the inheritance pattern of Apert syndrome?	The Apert syndrome is a rare disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene at locus 10q26; patients with this syndrome present severe syndactyly, exophthalmia, ocular hypertelorism and hypoplastic midface with Class III malocclusion, besides systemic alterations. The Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis and syndactyly of hands and feet. Although most cases are sporadic, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is well documented. Apert syndrome, or acrocephalosyndactyly, is characterized by craniosynostosis and early epiphyseal closure resulting in various deformities of the skull, hands, and feet. Typically a sporadic condition, autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance has been known to occur.  We report two observations of antenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome. This uncommon genetic disorder suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance, but almost all cases described are sporadic; the responsible gene is yet not located. The familial cases, the equal number of affected males and females, and the increased paternal age in sporadic cases strongly suggest autosomal dominant inheritance.  This report presents the first example of male transmission of Apert acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome. Female transmission has been reported in the five previous well-documented cases of dominant inheritance of the syndrome.	['Autosomal dominant']
52f21b722059c6d71c00000b	What is the usual HER-2 status in breast cancer associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome?	Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %). Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations. The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.

55192892622b194345000012	Which E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the interferon receptor type 1 (IFNAR1)?	IFNAR1 ubiquitination is facilitated by the βTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recruited to IFNAR1 upon its degron phosphorylation, which is induced by the ligand. Both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways converge on phosphorylation of Ser(535) within the IFNAR1 degron leading to recruitment of beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase and concomitant ubiquitination and degradation. The SCF(betaTrcp) (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box complex) E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation in cells can conjugate both types of chains in vitro.  Levels of IFNAR1 (regulated via degradation mediated by the betaTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase) and IFNalpha signaling were reduced in 1205Lu melanoma cell line that harbors activated BRAF and exhibits high levels of betaTrcp ubiquitin ligase. IFNalpha promotes the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser535, followed by recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, beta-TrCP2 (beta-transducin repeats-containing protein 2), ubiquitination of IFNAR1 and proteolysis.  Ubiquitination, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation of the IFNAR1 (interferon alpha receptor 1) subunit of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor is mediated by the SCFbeta-Trcp (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein beta transducin repeat-containing protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here we show that IFNAR1 interacts with the Homolog of Slimb (HOS) F-box protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and that this interaction is promoted by interferon alpha (IFNalpha). IFNAR1 is ubiquitinated by the Skp1-Cullin1-HOS-Roc1 (SCF(HOS)) ubiquitin ligase in vitro.

Tia1/Pub1 is a stress granule component carrying a Q/N-rich prion domain Codependent functions of RSK2 and the apoptosis-promoting factor TIA-1 in stress granule assembly and cell survival We report an unanticipated link between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1 Stress granule assembly is mediated by prion-like aggregation of TIA-1 TIA-1 is an RNA binding protein that promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs), discrete cytoplasmic inclusions into which stalled translation initiation complexes are dynamically recruited in cells subjected to environmental stress. The RNA recognition motifs of TIA-1 are linked to a glutamine-rich prion-related domain (PRD). Truncation mutants lacking the PRD domain do not induce spontaneous SGs and are not recruited to arsenite-induced SGs, whereas the PRD forms aggregates that are recruited to SGs in low-level-expressing cells but prevent SG assembly in high-level-expressing cells The PRD of TIA-1 exhibits many characteristics of prions: concentration-dependent aggregation that is inhibited by the molecular chaperone heat shock protein (HSP)70; resistance to protease digestion; sequestration of HSP27, HSP40, and HSP70; and induction of HSP70, a feedback regulator of PRD disaggregation. Substitution of the PRD with the aggregation domain of a yeast prion, SUP35-NM, reconstitutes SG assembly, confirming that a prion domain can mediate the assembly of SGs Our results reveal that prion-like aggregation of TIA-1 regulates SG formation downstream of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in response to stress Stress granule assembly is mediated by prion-like aggregation of TIA-1.

56f564f909dd18d46b000009	Which syndrome is associated with mutations in the LYST gene?	Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. A small number of reports of rare, attenuated forms of CHS exist, with affected individuals exhibiting progressive neurodegenerative disease beginning in early adulthood with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, features of spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as subtle pigmentary abnormalities and subclinical or absent immune dysfunction. Mutations in the CHS1 (LYST) gene result in CHS. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by variable degrees of oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections, and a mild bleeding tendency, with late neurologic dysfunction. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the LYST/CHS1 gene, which encodes for a 429 kDa protein, CHS1/LYST, that regulates vesicle trafficking and determines the size of lysosomes and other organelles.

51487dead24251bc05000030	Which pharmacogenetic test is available for abacavir?	Pharmacogenomic tests offer a promising strategy to improve the safety and efficacy of drug treatment. Compelling examples, such as HLA-B*5701 testing to identify patients at risk for abacavir-associated hypersensitivity, are already changing clinical care International HIV treatment guidelines recommend HLA-B*57:01 typing before abacavir administration, in order to reduce the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions, the major cause of early therapy discontinuation. A fast, sensitive and specific test for HLA-B*57:01 detection has been developed in the present study. The rollout of HLA-B∗5701 into routine clinical practice as a genetic screening test to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity provides a translational roadmap for other drugs. he aim of the session, using real-world examples (KRAS/panitumumab and HLA-B*5701/abacavir), was to identify good scientific principles that would guide the design of studies to identify subgroups of responders during development programs (including marketed drugs), which could subsequently be used to guide treatment decisions. HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is an example of a test now in widespread routine clinical use in the developed world. Successful results that have been achieved within the field of pharmacogenomics so far are, to name a few, HLA-B*5701 screening to avoid hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral abacavir, Prospective pharmacogenetic screening for the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701 allele can significantly reduce the number of cases of abacavir-related hypersensitivity among HIV-infected patients treated with this drug. development of HLA-B*5701 genetic screening as a means of preventing drug hypersensitivity reactions caused by a commonly prescribed antiretroviral drug, abacavir. Abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a potentially life-threatening illness occurring in 4-8% of those initiating the drug. Early studies identified a strong association between the MHC class I allele HLA-B*5701 and AHS. These studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 holds promise as a screening test to prevent AHS, but concern arose from HLA-B*5701-negative cases with a clinical diagnosis of AHS, and particularly from early reports of apparently low sensitivities of HLA-B*5701 for AHS in patients of non-White race. However, open screening studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 screening can largely eliminate AHS Current HIV treatment guidelines have been revised to reflect the recommendation that HLA-B*5701 screening be incorporated into routine care for patients who may require abacavir. The research approach applied to AHS has led to a genetic screening test being successfully implemented globally in primary HIV clinical practice. The clinical utility of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening was demonstrated in a blinded randomized clinical trial and in open-label cohorts. Screening has been incorporated into clinical practice and the ABC HSR pharmacogenetics program has been highlighted as a success by pharmacogenetics researchers. Abacavir hypersensitivity (ABC HSR) is a treatment-limiting adverse event associated with the use of the antiretroviral medicine, abacavir. The major histocompatibility complex allele, HLA-B*5701, was identified retrospectively and confirmed with independent sample sets. he most significant advance for clinical practice is the correlation between the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele and hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In particular, one clinical trial with a large number of patients from distinct ethnic groups found that the probability of not developing hypersensitivity reaction (immunologically confirmed) was 100% if the patient was HLA-B*5701-negative. These data suggest the need to implement this test in daily clinical practice. The aim of the PREDICT-1 study was to determine the clinical utility of the pharmacogenetic test identifying HLA-B*5701 to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, diagnosed clinically and with immunological confirmation, as well as to reduce unwarranted withdrawal of this drug the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing, immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events Pharmacogenetic testing for HLA-B*5701 is cost-effective only if abacavir-based treatment is as effective and costs less than tenofovir-based treatment. HLA-B*5701 testing remained the preferred strategy only if abacavir-based treatment had equal efficacy and cost less per month than tenofovir-based treatment. Results were also sensitive to the cost of HLA-B*5701 testing and the prevalence of HLA-B*5701. The strong association of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction with HLA-B*5701 permits testing patients for the allele, and if present avoiding the drug and therefore preventing the reaction. Although the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701 is highly associated with a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) to abacavir (ABC), variable sensitivities have been reported when clinical data alone have been used to define an ABC HSR Although IC ABC HSRs are uncommon in black persons, the 100% sensitivity of HLA-B*5701 as a marker for IC ABC HSRs in both US white and black patients suggests similar implications of the association between HLA-B*5701 positivity and risk of ABC HSRs in both races. A strong statistical association between the major histocompatibility complex allele, HLA-B*5701, and clinically diagnosed ABC HSR was identified but varied between racial populations. In a randomized, prospective study evaluating the clinical utility of HLA-B*5701 screening, avoidance of ABC in HLA-B*5701-positive patients significantly reduced clinically diagnosed ABC HSR and eliminated patch test-positive ABC HSR. Finally, a retrospective PGx study supports the generalizability of the association across races. Prospective HLA-B*5701 screening should greatly reduce the incidence of ABC HSR by identifying patients at high risk for ABC HSR before they are treated. Hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In predominantly white populations, similar to the one in this study, 94% of patients do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele and are at low risk for hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Our results show that a pharmacogenetic test can be used to prevent a specific toxic effect of a drug. For abacavir in particular, the use of HLA-B*5701 as a screening test appears to be generalizable across racially diverse populations and has been supported by both observational, and blinded randomized controlled trials. HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity is currently the most relevant to clinical practice and highlights that the promise of cost-effective testing can be facilitated by robust laboratory methodology and quality assurance programs that can be applied to diverse treatment settings. the major histocompatibility complex HLA-B*5701 allele has been associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir (ABC) by several independent researchers. The strong association between HLA-B5701 and abacavir hypersensitivity reaction shows promise for a genetic screening test to be feasibly incorporated into clinical practice. Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction (ABC HSR) is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction that affects approximately 8% of patients that initiate this antiretroviral drug. Independent groups have shown a strong predictive association between ABC HSR and HLA-B*5701, indicating that exclusion of HLA-B*5701 positive individuals from abacavir treatment would largely prevent ABC HSR. Abacavir, a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, causes severe hypersensitivity in 4-8% of patients. HLA B*5701 is a known genetic risk factor for abacavir hypersensitivity in Caucasians. Abacavir hypersensitivity is associated with HLA B*5701, and pre-prescription pharmacogenetic testing for this appears to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.	['HLA B*5701 genotyping']
53147b52e3eabad021000015	What is a benefit of being g6PD-deficient?	A central position of the PPP for malaria parasites is supported by the fact that human G6PD deficiency protects to a certain degree from malaria infections.  The beneficial effect of thalassemia minor, sickle-cell trait, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on survival of malaria infection may well be due to the shared feature of enhanced oxidative stress. This may inhibit parasite growth, enhance uptake of infected RBCs by spleen macrophages, and/or cause less cytoadherence of the infected cells to capillary endothelium.  In conclusion, genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with RBC traits in African-Americans.  G6PD deficiency has been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity. G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P. vivax predominates. Severe G6PDd was associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions. and G6PD (Xq28)-were associated (P ≤ 1 × 10(-6)) with RBC traits in the discovery cohort	['There is evidence of increased resistance to malaria.']
52bf1f2d03868f1b06000015	Which drug is benserazide usually co-administered with?	The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats.  Co-administration of L-Dopa with peripheral DDC inhibitors (carbidopa or benserazide) is the most effective symptomatic treatment for PD. In experiment 1, l-DOPA-primed rats were pre-treated with Vehicle (0.9% NaCl), various doses of the partial 5-HT(1A) agonist, buspirone (0.25, 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg, ip) or buspirone (2.5 mg/kg, ip)+the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg, ip) 5 min prior to l-DOPA (12 mg/kg+15 mg/kg benserazide, ip). R L-DOPA induced hyperalgesia occurred after conversion to dopamine because co-administration of benserazide, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, completely abolished the L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia.  First, animals were treated with levodopa (50 mg/kg with benserazide 12.5 mg/kg, twice daily), intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 22 days.  Chronic L-DOPA-treated rats received the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg; i.p.), the D2 receptor antagonist Eticlopride (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg; i.p.), a mixture of both antagonists (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg each; i.p.), or vehicle 30 min prior to L-DOPA (6 mg/kg; i.p.)+Benserazide (15 mg/kg; i.p.). Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.) They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-Dopa methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-Dopa/benserazide) alone or in combination with JL-18 (at the doses of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.9 mg/kg, s.c.). The administration of L-dopa (20 and 60 mg/kg p.o.) + benserazide (15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in dose-dependent increase of dialysate levels of L-dopa and 3-O-methyl-DOPA. Tolcapone (30 mg/kg p.o.), given as adjunct to both doses of L-dopa, markedly enhanced the elevation or extracellular L-dopa, while it completely prevented the formation of 3-O-methyl-DOPA. In another experiment, the administration of L-dopa + benserazide (30 + 15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in increased extracellular levels of dopamine, DOPAC, HVA and 3-methoxytyramine. In healthy subjects and in patients with parkinsonism plasma ALAAD level fell after administration of L-dopa + benserazide, but returned to previous levels within 90 min. In a cross-sectional study blood was obtained, 2 h after dosing, from 104 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, divided into four groups: no L-dopa treatment (group 1), L-dopa alone (group 2), L-dopa + benserazide (Madopar) (group 3) and L-dopa + carbidopa (Sinemet) (group 4).

52bf19f703868f1b06000002	What is the inheritance pattern of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) caused by RYR2 mutations?	Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrythmogenic disease characterized by exercise--or stress--induced ventricular tachyarrythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases. Previously, autosomal dominant catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT [1]) was mapped to chromosome 1q42-43 with identification of pathogenic mutations in RYR2.  Several mutations in the genes encoding RyR1 and RyR2 have been identified in autosomal dominant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle, such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), central core disease (CCD), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2).

5147c8a6d24251bc05000027	Which enzyme is deficient in Krabbe disease?	Krabbe disease is a lethal, demyelinating condition caused by genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and resultant accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), primarily in oligodendrocytes (OLs). In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. In almost all individuals with Krabbe disease, galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme activity is deficient (0%-5% of normal activity) in leukocytes isolated from whole heparinized blood or in cultured skin fibroblasts. This chapter describes in detail a practical procedure for the preparation of radiolabeled galactocerebroside and its use in the assay of galactocerebrosidase (GalCase), the enzyme deficient in globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease). Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by the pathogenomic accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), a substrate for the deficient enzyme galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase. Krabbe disease is an extremely rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 1,00,000 live births. It is caused by deficient activity of the Iysosomal hydrolase galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is characterized by the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is a substrate for the deficient enzyme (galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase). Krabbe disease (globoid-cell leukodystrophy; GLD) is caused by mutations in the GALC gene. Beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is a specific beta-galactosidase which is defective in GLD. Both galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (GALC-GC) and GALC-PS activities were reduced by at least 85% of the normal in all but 2 of the 10 GLD patients studied. Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. The disease can be diagnosed by detecting the deficiency of GALC activity (less than 5% of normal) in any available tissue sample. Globoid cell leukodystrophy, or Krabbe disease, is a severe disorder of the peripheral and central nervous system myelin caused by deficient galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GCL or Krabbe disease) is a recessive disease caused by mutations of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and twitcher is the murine model of GCL. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is the lysosomal enzyme deficient in human and certain animal species with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, the lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of the myelin glycolipid galactocerebroside. Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive inherited demyelinating disease, which is deficient in lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity is deficient in all patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD). Human galactocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Krabbe disease, was purified, through several hydrophobic column steps and gel filtration, 22,650-fold from human lymphocytes Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. 6-Hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (HMGal) has been shown to be a specific fluorogenic substrate of galactocerebrosidase and to facilitate the simple enzymatic diagnosis of Krabbe disease in human patients and in twitcher mice. The inherited deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.46: galactocerebrosidase) activity results in globoid cell leukodystrophy in humans (Krabbe disease) and in mice (twitcher mutant). The lack of complementation between Krabbe disease patient and twitcher mutant mouse cells provides further evidence that the twitcher mouse is an authentic murine model for Krabbe disease and supports the hypothesis that the mutations in both species are within the structural gene for the galactocerebrosidase enzyme. Galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase cross reacting material was demonstrated in brain, liver, and skin fibroblasts from patients with Krabbe disease. . In this study, LRs in the brain of the twitcher (TWI) mouse, a bona-fide model for infant variants of human globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease, were investigated. This mouse has deficient activity of GALC (beta-galactosylceramidase) that leads to a progressive accumulation of some galactosyl-sphingolipids in the brain. A GALC genotype with one deleted and one polymorphic GALC activity-reducing allele can lead to enzymatic and clinical signs of LOGLD in the absence of marked GALC-PS deficiency. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is deficient in all tissues from human patients and animal models with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. The purification of GALC and the securing of amino acid sequence information will aid in the cloning of the GALC gene. This enzyme is deficient in human patients with Krabbe disease and several animal species.	['galactocerebrosidase']
54f60ea05f206a0c06000009	Is there any genetic determinant of hair pigmentation that could be useful in forensic analyses?	a recent paper has reported the genetic determination of eye and hair color in samples up to 800 years old.   Here, we demonstrate that human hair color is predictable from DNA variants with similarly high accuracies. 12 genes previously associated with human hair color variation  several key pigmentation genes have been characterised, in particular the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R). Here, the function and known mutations of MC1R and other human pigmentation genes including ASIP, MATP, SLC24A5, TYR, TYRP1 and OCA2 are outlined, and a forensic test based on MC1R SNPs presented. Recent studies have proved that there is a significant association between some genetic variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene and red hair color. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype.  Interactions between HERC2, OCA2 and MC1R may influence human pigmentation phenotype. Several genome-wide association studies for pigmentation have now been conducted and identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in known, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP, KITLG and previously unknown SLC24A4, IRF4, TPCN2, candidate genes.   five red hair colour (RHC) MC1R alleles,  Naturally blond hair is rare in humans and found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania.

51631154298dcd4e5100004e	What disease is Velcade (bortezomib) mainly used for?	patients with multiple myeloma (MM) bortezomib, and lenalidomide have shown improved outcomes in these patients. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor drug very effective against multiple myeloma, may induce the so-called bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN), hardly manageable with common analgesic drugs. bortezomib have emerged as effective treatment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). the use of thalidomide to treat multiple myeloma, and describe problems arising in the Thaled® outpatient department. METHODS: Multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide at Hitachi General Hospital. Thalidomide showed some success in treating multiple myeloma either after auto-PBSCT or following treatment with bortezomib. In the case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), grave complications could have very easily developed, thus underscoring the importance of careful monitoring. Patients aged ≥18 years with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for 3 cycles. In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, co-administration of rifampicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the exposure to bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles. we provide data comparing sFLC with M protein as biomarkers of response in newly diagnosed patients with MM undergoing induction therapy with the novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and/or bortezomib. Bortezomib, indicated for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, is available in 3.5-mg vials, a quantity higher than the average dose commonly prescribed. Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid and potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is remarkably effective against multiple myeloma (MM) but not against solid tumors. efficacy and safety of bortezomib (BOR) for treatment of multiple myeloma in comparison with thalidomide (THAL) by reference to adverse events, and searched for laboratory markers that could be used for prognostication of patients. BOR showed a higher rate of effectiveness than THAL for refractory multiple myeloma, and its effects were rapid. BOR treatment prolonged the survival time of THAL-resistant patients. The efficacy of BOR was unrelated to patient age, the number of previous therapeutic regimens, or the disease period. It is suggested that BOR has therapeutic efficacy for multiple myeloma as a first-line medical treatment and/or for patients with THAL resistance, and can improve prognosis and survival. Since serum ALP elevation was observed in many patients for whom BOR was effective, this may be a predictor of BOR efficacy. Bortezomib-treated MM patients whose tumours had high baseline expression of genes suppressed by LCQ195 had significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival than those with low levels of these transcripts in their MM cells. These observations provide insight into the biological relevance of multi-targeted CDK inhibition in MM. bortezomib is the only effective agent in the treatment of plasma cell leukemia (PCL), a type of plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by poor prognosis despite conventional chemotherapy including autologous and allogeneic transplantation. These 3 patients with primary or secondary PCL who received a bortezomib-based regimen as rescue medication did not respond to treatment. To evaluate the effects and safety of the regimen of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone (VD) in the treatment of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis. VD regimen might be an efficient, rapid effective and safe regimen in the treatment of AL amyloidosis. Bortezomib (BZM) is a proteasome inhibitor in clinical use for multiple myeloma. Here, we investigated whether the combination of these compounds would yield increased antitumor efficacy in multiple myeloma and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have the potential to negate the therapeutic efficacy of BZM and suggest that consumption of green tea products may be contraindicated during cancer therapy with BZM. Relapsed/refractory myeloma has a poor outcome because of multi-drug resistance, patient low-performance status and toxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Bortezomib, by inhibiting proteasome function, may enhance chemosensitivity to other drugs and overcome drug-resistance. Notably, doxorubicin and bortezomib may reciprocally increase their efficacy. Thus, to improve outcome whilst minimizing therapy-related toxicity, liposomal doxorubicin was added to a bortezomib-based combination. the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with anti-EGFR drugs, such as gefitinib, vandetanib, and cetuximab in EGFR-expressing human cancer cell lines. Bortezomib determined dose-dependent growth inhibition in a nine cancer cell line panel (IC(50) values, range 6-42 nM). overexpression of a constitutively active P-Akt protected A549 cells by cell growth inhibition and apoptosis following treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors. The combined treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors has a synergistic growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity in different human cancer cells which possess a functional EGFR-dependent autocrine growth pathway through to a more efficient and sustained inhibition of Akt. Among 19 patients with breast cancer, four had evidence of a clinical benefit. Pre-clinical studies combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with anthracyclines have shown enhanced anti-tumor activity. We conducted a phase I trial of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with refractory solid tumors. A regimen of bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with PLD, 30 mg/m(2), on day 4 of a 21-day cycle, was safe in this study, and merits further investigation. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been used for patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia. Bortezomib, a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, has shown clinical activity in relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma in a pivotal Phase II trial, SUMMIT. treatment with bortezomib results in meaningful long-term benefit for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), used in antineoplastic chemotherapy, must be diluted in NaCl 0.9% for injection and stored for no more than 3 hours in a syringe or 8 hours in a vial. Proteasome inhibitors, a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents, enhance the antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines in vitro and in vivo. We therefore sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PegLD). Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 from 0.90 to 1.50 mg/m2 and PegLD on day 4 at 30 mg/m2 to 42 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Antitumor activity was seen against multiple myeloma, with 8 of 22 evaluable patients having a complete response (CR) or near-CR, including several with anthracycline-refractory disease, and another 8 having partial responses (PRs). One patient with relapsed/refractory T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) achieved a CR, whereas 2 patients each with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell NHL had PRs. Bortezomib/PegLD was safely administered in this study with promising antitumor activity, supporting further testing of this regimen. These patients were treated with bortezomib variously combined with other drugs outside of clinical trials.	['multiple myeloma']

Original Fanconi anemia data, for which no information about the ascertainment was available, were then analyzed, with results that confirmed a monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. X-linked inheritance has important consequences for genetic counseling of families with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B. Its presence as a single active copy and essentiality for a functional Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway make FANCB a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity.

56c04412ef6e39474100001b	Which molecule is targeted by Daratumumab?	Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma.  Daratumumab is a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human monoclonal antibody against unique CD38 epitope with broad-spectrum killing activity. This review focuses on the CD38 antigen and its targeting with daratumumab and provides an update on the results of recent clinical studies involving daratumumab. BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells.  CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs.  Here, we describe that treatment of multiple myeloma patients with daratumumab, a novel anti-CD38 MoAb, resulted in false-positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs) for all patients for 2 to 6 months after infusion.  Interference of daratumumab and three other anti-CD38 MoAbs was studied using fresh-frozen plasma spiked with different MoAb concentrations. Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human monoclonal antibody against unique CD38 epitope with broad-spectrum killing activity.  This article focuses on the basic and clinical aspects of several emerging and promising novel MoAbs for MM, such as elotuzumab which targets CS1 and daratumumab which targets CD38.  This is likely to change within the next few years with a number of mAb therapies being assessed in late stage clinical trials, most notably, the anti-CS-1 mAb, elotuzumab, and the anti-CD38 mAb, daratumumab, which are currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for MM.

In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in CD38-expressing lymphoma- and MM-derived cell lines as well as in patient MM cells, both with autologous and allogeneic effector cells.  Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient MM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were not affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenvironment. In vivo, daratumumab was highly active and interrupted xenograft tumor growth at low dosing.

In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope.  Daratumumab is a novel human CD38 monoclonal antibody which kills CD38+ multiple myeloma cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: To explore the effect of lenalidomide combined with daratumumab, we first carried out standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays in which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell line UM-9 and primary multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients were used as target cells.  These findings support clinical development of daratumumab for the treatment of CD38-positive MM tumors. In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. A novel therapeutic strategy that effectively targets specific molecules on myeloma cells and also potentially overcomes tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance and the downstream effects of genetic instability is thus urgently needed.

5314bd7ddae131f847000006	Which hormone receptor function is altered in patients with Donohue syndrome?	This disease is caused by a defective insulin receptor and features abnormal glucose metabolism and retarded intrauterine and postnatal growth. Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS).  Severe progressive obstructive cardiomyopathy and renal tubular dysfunction in Donohue syndrome with decreased insulin receptor autophosphorylation due to a novel INSR mutation. Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism; OMIM *246200) is a rare, recessively inherited disorder of extreme insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) causing either defects in insulin binding or receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity. Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome): a case bearing novel compound heterozygous mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) is the most severe type of insulin receptor (INSR) gene anomaly with the majority of patients surviving for only 2 years. A novel mutation of the insulin receptor gene in a preterm infant with Donohue syndrome and heart failure. Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the gene encoding the insulin receptor. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance, including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, which differ in the level of severity.  Donohue syndrome in a neonate with homozygous deletion of exon 3 of the insulin receptor gene. Donohue syndrome describes the clinical consequences of the most severe genetic loss of insulin receptor function. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within the insulin binding domain of the human insulin receptor (INSR) are usually associated with severe impairment of insulin binding leading to Donohue syndrome ("Leprechaunism"), which is characterized by excessive hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, distinct dysmorphism and early death.  The former mutation has been described in homozygous form in Donohue syndrome, while the latter is novel. 	['insulin receptor']
55180ef46487737b43000006	What is the typical rash associated with gluten ?	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmunity-driven inflammatory blistering dermatosis associated with a gluten-dependent enteropathy.  Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune blistering disease that appears as a cutaneous manifestation of gluten intolerance.  Treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis is based on a life-long, strict gluten-free diet, which improves all clinical aspects of gluten sensitivity, and dapsone, a drug that is only effective for the skin manifestations. Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease are gluten-sensitive diseases that share immunopathological mechanisms. We report the unusual case of an 8-month-old child presenting to his general practitioner with pruritic skin lesions, subsequently proven to be dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) as the first sign of gluten-sensitive disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity.   These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised by IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaminase.  There is growing evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. BACKGROUND: A life-long gluten-free diet is the treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis, which is considered to be coeliac disease of the skin.  We report long-term clinical and histological remissions in seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the reintroduction of dietary gluten. Gluten sensitive enteropathy has various manifestations, of which the two major forms are classical coeliac disease (cCD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent.  Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a specific dermatological manifestation of coeliac disease and 80% of DH patients have gluten sensitive enteropathy manifested by crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy.  The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a lifelong, gluten-sensitive, blistering skin disease with pathognomonic immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposits in the papillary dermis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy.  Serum IgA class antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) are increased in untreated patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and it has been suggested that salivary IgA-AGA measurements could be used as a non-invasive screening test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy.  Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. The central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal biopsy. The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent. The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity. This contrasts to the situation in dermatitis herpetiformis, where both the rash and the enteropathy are gluten dependent.

51716e808ed59a060a00000b	Which is the vector of Louping ill virus?	Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. n Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. The complex pathogen-host-vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector. We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system. This study has examined the efficacy following intramuscular administration of a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) vaccine, encoding the prME and NS1 proteins of louping ill virus (LIV), in sheep. Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered.

56f553e309dd18d46b000006	What is the function of the spliceosome complex?	The spliceosome machinery is composed of multimeric protein complexes that generate a diverse repertoire of mRNA through coordinated splicing of heteronuclear RNAs.  Splicing and alternate splicing are the two key biological processes that result in the generation of diverse transcript and protein isoforms in Plasmodium falciparum as well as in other eukaryotic organisms.   Spliceosome assembly belongs to the key processes that enable splicing of mRNA and modulate alternative splicing. The excision of introns from nascent eukaryotic transcripts is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a highly complex and dynamic macromolecular machine composed of RNA and protein.  Recent advances have begun to provide exciting new insights into the dynamic interactions that govern the function of the spliceosome, the multi-megadalton complex that performs splicing.

55450521bf90a13052000001	What is the effect of enamel matrix derivative on pulp regeneration?	Among the human studies, two studies reported that EMD is a more efficient DPC procedure compared with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 ). One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC procedures EMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCs  the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulated EMD could enhance the mineralization of hDPSCs upregulated the expression of markers for odontoblast/osteoblast-like cells. Further studies are required to determine if EMD can improve pulp tissue repair and regeneration In both the scaffold groups, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin messenger RNA was up-regulated significantly in EMD-treated hDPCs when compared with the nontreated cells Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposure In the EMD-treated teeth, large amounts of newly formed dentin-like hard tissue with associated formative cells outlined the pulpal wound separating the cavity area from the remaining pulp tissue Inflammatory cells were present in the wound area but not subjacent to the newly formed hard tissue. Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p < 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide	['increase of the osteogenic potential of hDPCs']
533c390bc45e13371400000b	What is an acceptable sequence coverage(depth) required for human whole-exome sequencing?	A total of 5.97 Gb clean data were generated for the two samples, achieving a mean depth of coverage of 31.96 and 32.88 for the AAA and normal samples, respectively. The 1.7 Mb targeted regions were sequenced with a coverage ranged from 32× to 45× for the 28 genes. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 87 HCCs and matched normal adjacent tissues to an average coverage of 59× We performed WES (mean coverage approximately 40×) on 10 trios comprised of unaffected parents and a child with sporadic epilepsy characterized by difficult-to-control seizures and some combination of developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, cognitive impairment, or motor deficits. Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard bioinformatics tools. Whole-exome sequencing achieved a high degree of coverage such that approximately 97% of targeted bases were represented by more than 10 base reads; AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5-30×) and sample size (20-10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans).  Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed. mtDNA genome coverage varied depending on the mtDNA:nuclear blend ratio, where a 1:100 ratio provided optimal dual-genome coverage with 10X coverage for over 97.5% of all targeted nuclear regions and 1,000X coverage for 99.8% of the mtDNA genome. mtDNA mutations were reliably detected to at least an 8% heteroplasmy level, as discriminated both from sequencing errors and potential contamination from nuclear mtDNA transcripts (Numts). Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than 120× Long-PCR targeting was more efficient with up to 94% of USH gene regions displaying an overall coverage higher than 25×, whereas whole exome sequencing yielded a similar coverage for only 50% of those regions. WES reads covered 91% of the target capture region (of size 37.2 MB) with an average coverage of 65×. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold. The specificity of exome enrichment was approximately 80% with 95.6% even coverage of the 34 Mb target region at an average sequencing depth of 33-fold We generated over 4.7 GB of mappable sequence to a 125X read coverage per sample. By massively parallel sequencing of a primary hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (36× coverage) and matched lymphocytes (>28× coverage) from the same individual, we identified more than 11,000 somatic substitutions of the tumor genome that showed predominance of T>C/A>G transition and a decrease of the T>C substitution on the transcribed strand, suggesting preferential DNA repair. Whole-exome sequencing at a higher sequence depth (>76× coverage) revealed a TSC1 nonsense substitution in a subpopulation of the tumor cells.  We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56×. We performed medium-depth (8×) whole exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI >27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1) Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50� using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed.

531a3a58b166e2b806000037	To what extent does HPV vaccination reduce the risk for cervical cancer?	The success of HPV vaccination as a major public health prevention opportunity, however, will entirely depend on efficient infrastructures to deliver the vaccines and on the acceptance by individuals, parents and health care providers. The most effective strategy therein was vaccination of 12-year-olds, plus a temporary 12-24-year-old catch-up program covering both sexes; whereby HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, high-grade cervical precancer, and genital wart incidence was reduced by 84-98% during year 50 following vaccine introduction the introduction of cervical screening programs, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has been drastically reduced On the assumption that the vaccine provided lifelong immunity, the cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was $43,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, as compared with the current screening practice Vaccine efficacy in prevention of CIN 2 or higher lesions in HPV 16 or HPV 18 negative women, who received all vaccination doses, ranges between 98% and 100% Life expectancy gained from vaccination is 13.04 years and average Quality Adjusted Life Years saved (QALYs) is 24.4 in vaccinated vs 6.29 in unvaccinated Organized vaccination programs against HPV have the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancers and the vast majority of the other HPV-related conditions.  However, existing data strongly suggests that as many as 440,000 cervical cancer cases and 220,000 deaths due to this malignancy will be prevented with the establishment of an effective worldwide HPV immunization program Prophylactic HPV vaccination against HPV 16 and 18 has been shown to be highly effective in preventing HPV related malignancy in clinical trials Nevertheless women up to 45 years of age have been shown to exhibit strong immune responses to the bivalent HPV vaccine which might be expected to reduce the risk of HPV re-infection and address the second peak of HPV related malignancy in later life, evident over 45 years of age Reduced costs, simple vaccine regimes and strengthening vaccine delivery platforms for adolescents should eventually facilitate HPV vaccine introduction in developing countries. Besides cost, there are several socio-cultural and ethical issues involved with the implementation of already developed vaccines including the acceptability of HPV vaccination by preadolescent girls and their parents in India.

5339edd6d6d3ac6a34000061	Which is the clinical meaning of the presence of delayed enhancement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	The extent of regional myocardial fibrosis is associated with regional myocardial function independently of morphological changes of the myocardium, and the correlation extended to global LV function. Occurrence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with left atrial and ventricular dysfunction as well as with the severity of heart failure symptoms. Patients with symptomatic apical HCMshowed myocardial hyperenhancement involving the subendocardial layer, which might be related to regional systolic dysfunction, serious clinical symptoms, and ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, late gadolinium enhancement was associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmic risk factors, and worse New York Heart Association class. The presence of DE was related to occurrence of heart failure symptoms (P=0.05) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P=0.001). DE (7%+/-7% of left ventricle) was present in 54 patients who were asymptomatic (and with normal ejection fraction).  In HCM, the DE was associated with higher NYHA classes and prevalence of VT, impaired global LV function and asymmetrical hypertrophy, and conduction disturbance, abnormal Q waves, and giant negative T waves.  In myocardial segments exhibiting DCE, hMBF is reduced. DCE extent is inversely correlated and hMBF directly correlated with systolic thickening. In segments without DCE but contiguous to DCE areas, hMBF is significantly lower than in those remote from DCE and is similar to the value obtained in nontransmural DCE segments. These results suggest that increasing degrees of coronary microvascular dysfunction might play a causative role for myocardial fibrosis in HCM. In this large HCM cohort with no or only mild symptoms, myocardial fibrosis detected by CMR was associated with greater likelihood and increased frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including NSVT) on ambulatory Holter ECG. Therefore, contrast-enhanced CMR identifies HCM patients with increased susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

5156be17d24251bc05000086	What disease is mirtazapine predominantly used for?	mirtazapine will make it the first-choice drug in depressive patients with gastric ulcers. If antidepressants are used to treat insomnia, sedating ones should be preferred over activating agents such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In general, drugs lacking strong cholinergic activity should be preferred. Drugs blocking serotonin 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors should be preferred over those whose sedative property is caused by histamine receptor blockade only. The dose should be as low as possible (e.g. as an initial dose: doxepin 25 mg, mirtazapine 15 mg, trazodone 50 mg, trimipramine 25 mg). Regarding the lack of substantial data allowing for evidence-based recommendations, we are facing a clear need for well designed, long-term, comparative studies to further define the role of antidepressants versus other agents in the management of insomnia. second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. patients 65 years or older with major depression. METHODS: Antidepressant therapy with 15 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 20 to 40 mg/d of paroxetine (n = 122) A case report involving linezolid with citalopram and mirtazepine in the precipitation of serotonin syndrome in a critically ill bone marrow transplant patient is described in this article. other antidepressants was associated with the highest HRs for all-cause mortality (1.66, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self-harm (5.16, 95% CI 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/TIA (1.37, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.55), fracture (1.63, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.83) and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.15) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. TCAs did not have the highest HR for any of the outcomes. There were also significantly different associations between the individual drugs for seven outcomes, with trazodone, mirtazapine and venlafaxine associated with the highest rates for several of these outcomes. But when trazodone, amitriptyline or mirtazapine were used to treat depression, respectively, 92.3, 55.5 and 44.5 % of prescribed dosages were below the MED. In the indication of insomnia, most of the time, trazodone (90.5 %) or mirtazapine (5.4 %) were used, and in lower dosages than those required for depression treatment (<MED) Mirtazapine was the most common AD in 2001, followed by citalopram, sertraline, and doxepin. antidepressant treatment with mirtazapine	['major depression']
516e5f10298dcd4e5100007c	Is cancer related to global DNA hypo or hypermethylation?	Regions of focal DNA hypermethylation and long-range hypomethylation in colorectal cancer Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation Comparison of CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation in premalignant stages of gastric cancer CpG island hypermethylation and genomic DNA hypomethylation are found not only in gastric cancers but also in associated premalignant lesions Methylation of repetitive DNA elements in gastric lesions generally decreased with progression of the gastric lesion along the multistep carcinogenesi our findings suggest that CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation are enhanced with progression of the gastric lesion DNA hypomethylation arises later in prostate cancer progression than CpG island hypermethylation Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA was one of the first somatic epigenetic alterations discovered in human cancers. DNA hypomethylation is postulated to occur very early in almost all human cancers, perhaps facilitating genetic instability and cancer initiation and progression. Contrary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all human cancers, we show that reductions in (5me)C content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a significant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease These findings provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation changes occur later in prostate carcinogenesis than the CpG island hypermethylation changes and occur heterogeneously during prostate cancer progression and metastatic dissemination. revealed a high incidence of hypermethylation only in poorly differentiated (early and late) tumors. In contrast to gene hypermethylation, genomic DNA hypomethylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive elements and loss of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, occurred in both early and late stages of prostate cancer. Tumors have reduced levels of genomic DNA methylation and contain hypermethylated CpG islands The results are consistent with a specific defect in methylation of repetitive DNA sequences in human cancer. Both hypomethylation and hypermethylation in a 0.2-kb region of a DNA repeat in cancer Differential DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation signatures in colorectal cancer Cancer cells are characterized by a generalized disruption of the DNA methylation pattern involving an overall decrease in the level of 5-methylcytosine together with regional hypermethylation of particular CpG islands We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression	['Global hypomethylation is coupled with focal hypermethylation at CpG islands']

514c3fd7d24251bc05000062	Intact macromolecular assemblies are analysed by advanced mass spectrometry. How large complexes (in molecular weight) have been studied?	Here we show that the Orbitrap mass analyzer can be used to measure protein assemblies of molecular weights approaching one megadalton with sensitivity down to the detection of single ions. Using this relationship we show that we can determine masses of both 30S subunits and intact 2.3 MDa 70S ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus. We confirm the existence of these subpopulations using tandem mass spectrometry of intact 30S subunits. Overall, the results show that, rather than uniform particles, gas-phase ribosomes consist of a number of discrete populations. More generally, the results establish a rigorous procedure for accurate mass measurement and spectral analysis of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies.	['2.3 megadalton']
56c1f01cef6e394741000044	What is targeted by Palbociclib?	BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation, recombinant, human immunoglobulin G1 EGFR antibody.  Epidermal growth factor receptor-directed monoclonal antibodies in nonsmall cell lung cancer: an update.  A Southwest Oncology Group study currently prospectively evaluates the predictive biomarkers for cetuximab. In the SQUIRE phase III trial, necitumumab added to cisplatin and gemcitabine increased the survival in patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC.  BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 EGFR monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits ligand binding.  Numerous other drugs are in earlier stages of development for HNSCC treatment, including novel anti-EGFR mAbs (MEHD7945A, necitumumab, and RO5083945), small-molecule TKIs (vandetanib, icotinib, and CUDC-101), EGFR antisense, various add-on therapies to radiation and chemotherapy (bevacizumab, interleukin-12, lenalidomide, alisertib, and VTX-2337), and drugs (temsirolimus, everolimus, OSI-906, dasatinib, and PX-866) intended to overcome resistance to anti-EGFR agents.  Necitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC.  Necitumumab is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two randomized phase III trials. Joining cetuximab, sorafenib, afatinib, intedanib, and crizotinib in phase III development for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are ramucirumab (developed by ImClone, a subsidiary of Lilly), necitumumab (developed by ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb), and tivantinib (ARQ 197, developed by ArQule and Daiichi Sankyo). Necitumumab is a second-generation anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) similar to cetuximab. Necitumunab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, having the potential benefit of lower hypersensitivity reaction risk as compared with cetuximab and also equivalent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Necitumumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR, is currently under development as a treatment for advanced NSCLC. A phase I pharmacologic study of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR in patients with advanced solid malignancies. PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab.

56b1f4300a360a5e4500001b	Which peptide plays a pivotal role in human cystatin C fibrillization?	Human cystatin C (HCC) is a low molecular weight member of the cystatin family (type2). HCC consists of 120 amino acids. Normally it is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, but in pathological conditions it forms amyloid fibrils in brain arteries of young adults. An 'aggregation-prone' pentapeptide ((47)LQVVR(51)) was located within the HCC sequence using AmylPred, an 'aggregation-prone' peptide prediction algorithm developed in our lab. This peptide was synthesized and self-assembled into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies reveal. Thus, the (47)LQVVR(51) peptide seems to have an important role in HCC fibrillization. The pentapeptide LQVVR plays a pivotal role in human cystatin C fibrillization. the (47)LQVVR(51) peptide seems to have an important role in HCC fibrillization. Thus, the (47)LQVVR(51) peptide seems to have an important role in HCC fibrillization.	['LQVVR']
5325fdf0600967d132000001	What is the gold standard treatment for Iatrogenic male incontinence?	The initial treatment for SUI that persists after 12 months consists of conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and behavioral therapy. Properly selected and informed patients can also be treated efficiently with minimally invasive procedures such as the implantation of a male suburethral sling, although the experience with such devices is not extensive. However, the implantation of artificial urinary sphincter is the gold standard therapy. treatments such as periurethral injection of bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation, and sub-urethral sling positioning. The artificial urethral sphincter has represented, until today, the gold standard but, in the recent years, sling systems have been investigated as minimally invasive alternative options. Today, three different sling procedures are commonly performed: bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems. The bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling is a simple and attractive procedure that can produce immediate good results with low morbidity, especially when strictly selected patients are treated.  BAUS implantation is a safe, effective, minimally invasive option for iatrogenic male incontinence due to ISD. It compares favourably with AUS.	['Artificial urethral sphincter', 'AUS']
5357b36cf1005d6b58000006	Which is the main CHEK2 genetic variant, thought to be involved in familial breast cancer?	the two most studied breast cancer-predisposing variants of the CHEK2 gene, 1100delC and I157T The CHEK2-1100delC mutation is recurrent in the population and is a moderate risk factor for breast cancer The germline CHEK2-1100delC mutation was present among 8/1,646 (0.5%) sporadic, 2/400 (0.5%) early-onset and 3/302 (1%) familial breast cancer cases, but undetectable amongst 2,105 multiethnic controls, including 633 from the US. 1100delC appears to be the only recurrent CHEK2 mutation associated with a potentially significant contribution to breast cancer risk in the general population Our findings highlight the notion that clinical testing for rare missense mutations within CHEK2 may have limited value in predicting breast cancer risk, but that testing for the 1100delC variant may be valuable in phenotypically- and geographically-selected populations. Variants in CHEK2 other than 1100delC do not make a major contribution to breast cancer susceptibility. We recently reported that a sequence variant in the cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase CHEK2 (CHEK2 1100delC) is a low-penetrance breast cancer-susceptibility allele in noncarriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations These results indicate that 1100delC may be the only CHEK2 allele that makes an appreciable contribution to breast cancer susceptibility. CHEK2_1100delC was found in 5/903 (0.5%) breast cancer cases compared to 1/1016 (0.1%) controls. Recently, the CHEK 2 gene, involved in DNA damage and replication checkpoints, has been pointed out as a good candidate; moreover, a specific variant in this gene,1100delC, has been found to increase breast cancer susceptibility among familial breast cancer cases not attributable to mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

530f900ee3eabad021000003	Which hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome?	This syndrome is characterized by axial hypotonia, severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, spastic paraplegia, and a typical thyroid hormone profile.  Our case and the review of the pertinent literature suggest that Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome should be suspected in males with the typical neurological and thyroid profile, even in cases with normal brain myelination. Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition, is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays, in combination with altered thyroid hormone levels, in particular, high serum T3 levels.  Mutations in the MCT8 gene are associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), consisting of severe psychomotor retardation and disturbed TH parameters. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition, is characterized by severe intellectual disability, dysarthria, athetoid movements, muscle hypoplasia and spastic paraplegia in combination with altered TH levels, in particular, high serum T3 levels.  In two generations its presence was detected in the hemizygous state in two males with neurological abnormalities including mental retardation, axial hypotonia, hypertonia of arms and legs and athetoid movements. One of them presented normal thyroid hormone levels.  Our results show the difficulty of distinguishing AHDS from patients with X-linked intellectual disability solely on the basis of clinical features and biochemical tests, and we advise screening for MCT8 mutations in either young or older patients with severe intellectual disability, axial hypotonia/dystonia, poor head control, spastic paraplegia, and athetoid movements even when they have normal thyroid hormone profiles. Hemizygous MCT8 mutations in males cause severe psychomotor retardation, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), and abnormal serum TH levels. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe psychomotor retardation characterized by neurological impairment and abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels.  The hallmarks of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, caused by MCT8 mutations, are severe psychomotor retardation and elevated T(3) levels. Inactivating mutations in the gene encoding MCT8 are associated with a severe form of psychomotor retardation and abnormal serum TH levels (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome).  Mutations of this transporter determine a distinct X-linked psychomotor retardation syndrome (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS)) that is attributed to disturbed thyroid hormone levels, especially elevated T(3) levels. This syndrome is characterized by abnormally high T3, low/normal T4 serum levels and slightly elevated serum TSH. High D1 activity in liver and kidney increases T4 and rT3 deiodination, and contributes to the increased serum T3. One of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe mental retardation associated with abnormal thyroid hormone constellations.  The endocrine phenotype showed low serum total and free thyroxine (T4), very elevated total and free triiodothyronine (T3) and normal thyrotropin (TSH) with blunted response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8, SLC16A2) is a thyroid hormone (TH) transmembrane transport protein mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe X-linked psychomotor retardation.  The clinical importance of TH transporters is dramatically shown in patients with mutations in MCT8, suffering from severe X-linked psychomotor retardation in combination with disturbed TH levels, especially high serum T(3) levels, now referred as Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS).  Therefore, the criterion for MCT8 mutation screening in these patients is the profile of increased T(3) and low-normal to low FT(4) serum levels. However, T3 level was elevated. AIM: Mutations in the SLC16A2 gene have been implicated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked learning disability* syndrome associated with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities. Dystonic cerebral palsy was the most common initial clinical diagnosis, and AHDS was suspected only retrospectively, considering the characteristically abnormal thyroid function tests, with high serum tri-iodothyronine (T(3)), as the most consistent finding. Although dysmorphic features suggestive of AHDS are not always present, T(3) measurement is a reliable screening test. Mutations in one of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), have been identified as underlying cause for the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked mental retardation in which the patients also present with abnormally high 3',3,5-triiodothyronine (T(3)) plasma levels. With the discovery of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a specific thyroid hormone transporter and the finding that mutations in this transporter lead to a syndrome of severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine levels known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, the interest in this area of research has greatly increased.  Elevated serum triiodothyronine and intellectual and motor disability with paroxysmal dyskinesia caused by a monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene mutation. Additionally, the patient has a lesion in the left putamen region revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and elevated serum T3 levels. The identified MCT8 gene mutation (R271H) is very likely to be the genetic cause for neuronal hypothyroidism despite elevated serum T3 levels. Abnormal transport function is reflected by elevated free T3 and decreased free T4 levels along with clinical features characterized by neurological abnormalities including global developmental delay, central hypotonia, rotatory nystagmus, impaired hearing, spasticity and contractures of joints. We report a child with classical clinical features along with confirmatory deranged thyroid levels in blood. Consistent with previous reports on MCT8 missense changes, the patient with c.1673G>A showed elevated serum T3 level.  Moreover, we characterized a de novo translocation t(X;9)(q13.2;p24) in a female patient with full blown AHDS clinical features including elevated serum T3 levels. Taken together, these data indicate that MCT8 mutations are not common in non-AHDS MR patients yet they support that elevated serum T3 levels can be indicative for AHDS and that AHDS clinical features can be present in female MCT8 mutation carriers whenever there is unfavorable nonrandom X-inactivation. Endocrine functions other than thyroid hormone regulation and metabolism were intact, resulting in normal hypothalamic/pituitary function tests. Conclusion: the characteristic thyroid hormone function tests and brain MRI findings may allow screening of high-risk populations for a better understanding of MCT8 pathophysiology. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range. Pathogenic mutations in the MCT8 gene, which encodes a thyroid hormone transporter, results in elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, which were confirmed in four affected males of this family, while normal levels were found among obligate carriers. In addition, the severe muscle hypoplasia observed in most AHDS patients may be a consequence of high serum T3 levels. Abnormal transporter function is reflected in elevated free triiodothyronine and lowered free thyroxine levels in the blood.  Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development.

517194ef8ed59a060a000011	Which is the causative agent of malaria?	lasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. < Overcoming antigenic variation is one of the major challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of human malaria. [The vivax malaria causative agent Plasmodium ovale: the present global area, intraspecies polymorphism, importation to the Russian Federation (1992-2011)]. The global area for Plasmodium ovale is small as compared with that for other species of human malaria pathogens. Parasites that have been described to affect the central nervous system (CNS), either as the dominant or as a collateral feature, include cestodes (Taenia solium (neurocysticerciasis), Echinococcus granulosus (cerebral cystic echinococcosis), E. multilocularis (cerebral alveolar echinococcosis), Spirometra mansoni (neurosparganosis)), nematodes (Toxocara canis and T. cati (neurotoxocariasis), Trichinella spiralis (neurotrichinelliasis), Angiostrongylus cantonensis and A. costaricensis (neuroangiostrongyliasis), Gnathostoma spinigerum (gnathostomiasis)), trematodes (Schistosoma mansoni (cerebral bilharziosis), Paragonimus westermani (neuroparagonimiasis)), or protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii (neurotoxoplasmosis), Acanthamoeba spp. or Balamuthia mandrillaris (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis), Naegleria (primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis), Entamoeba histolytica (brain abscess), Plasmodium falciparum (cerebral malaria), Trypanosoma brucei gambiense/rhodesiense (sleeping sickness) or Trypanosoma cruzi (cerebral Chagas disease)) Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a deadly infectious disease for which treatments are scarce and drug-resistant parasites are now increasingly found. In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages. Whereas no biological activity was previously identified for 1, the material derived from the efficient synthesis enabled additional bioactivity tests leading to the identification of a notable activity against insect cells and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, encodes an SSB protein that localizes to the apicoplast and likely functions in the replication and maintenance of its genome. While observing cells by time-lapse imaging is a standard procedure in many systems, this technique was until recently not available for blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, possesses three translationally active compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondrion and a relic plastid called the apicoplast. The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate. The genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a tandemly repeated, linear element of 6 kb. The culminating step of the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is the spectacular release of multiple invasive merozoites on rupture of the infected erythrocyte membrane. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria, is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. The Hsp90 protein from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is critical for this organism's survival; the anti-Hsp90 drug geldanamycin is toxic to P. falciparum growth. A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria. The Plasmodium parasite, causative agent of malaria, infects RBC that are phagocytosed by DC and macrophages during the course of infection. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease where new drug targets are required due to increasing resistance to current anti-malarials. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, invades host erythrocytes using several proteins on the surface of the invasive merozoite, which have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates. Few studies have investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for what seems to be a possible interaction between Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, and HIV-1 in dually infected patients. We show that orthochromatic cells are the earliest stages that may be invaded by Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal human malaria. Infection by Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is associated with hemolysis and therefore with release of hemoglobin from RBC. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases Plasmodium falciparum, the most important causative agent of human malaria, undergoes antigenic variation as a means of prolonging infection and ensuring transmission between hosts. L-Malate dehydrogenase (PfMDH) from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for the most severe form of malaria, has shown remarkable similarities to L: -lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). FQ is able to overcome the chloroquine (CQ) resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum posses a single aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which represents a potential drug target for treatment of the disease. An essential requisite for transmission of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is the successful completion of a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) has been implicated in pathogenesis through its role in var gene silencing. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, is totally dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the fatal form of malaria, synthesizes GMP primarily from IMP and, hence, needs active GMPS (GMP synthetase) for its survival. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most serious form of malaria, infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year. Plasmodium vivax is an important human pathogen causing malaria in more temperate climates of the world. Similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for malaria tropica, drug resistance is beginning to emerge for this parasite species and this hampers adequate treatment of infection. Malaria kills more than one million people a year, and understanding the historical association between its most notorious causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, and its mosquito vectors is important in fighting the disease. We show here that macrophages are mandatory for NK cell IFN-gamma secretion in response to erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), a causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe and mortal type of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the main causative agent of tropical malaria, the most severe parasitic disease in the world. Growing resistance of Plasmodia towards available drugs is an increasing problem in countries where malaria is endemic. The presence of antisense RNA in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, remains controversial. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore the family of antioxidant enzymes, peroxiredoxins (Prxs) represent a target for antimalarial drug design. In the Republic of Yemen, Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant causative agent of malaria and is associated with adverse consequences for pregnant women and their babies. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions to invade host red blood cells (RBCs). Comparative genomic analysis of the malaria causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, with other eukaryotes for which the complete genome is available, revealed that the genome from P. falciparum was more similar to the genome of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, than to other non-apicomplexan taxa. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, totally depends on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies extensively on glycolysis coupled with homolactic fermentation during its blood-borne stages for energy production. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes. Seven sPLA(2)s from groups IA, IB, IIA and III, were tested here in different culture conditions for inhibition of the in vitro intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, relies on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. In spite of research efforts to develop vaccines against the causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, effective control remains elusive. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to undergo sexual differentiation and development in anopheline mosquitoes for transmission to occur. For Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of tropical malaria, TrxR is an essential protein which has been validated as a drug target. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must first infect hepatocytes to initiate a mammalian infection. Cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs) have become attractive drug targets in an effort to identify effective inhibitors of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. It is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong CD8(+) T cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, Plasmodium spp. A novel method for the in vitro detection of the protozoan Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has been developed. Trypanosomes do not inhabit or grow in anopheles mosquitoes, the vector for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites the causative agent for malaria. The genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, rapidly approaches completion, but our ability to genetically manipulate this organism remains limited. It is caused by a number of species of the genus Plasmodium, and Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form. To complete its life cycle in the mosquito, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to traverse the epithelia of the midgut and salivary glands. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, the catalytic subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Pfpka-c) exists as a single copy. Sulfadoxine is the most extensively used drug of this group of drugs and is usually combined with pyrimethamine (Fansidar), particularly for the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria. Resistance to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination is widespread. A putative glutathione peroxidase gene (Swiss-Prot accession number Z 68200) of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is an asexual blood-stage protein expressed in the invasive merozoite form of Plasmodia species, which are the causative agent of malaria. In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, this approach is especially interesting, because here both key enzymes, ODC and AdoMetDC, are combined in a bifunctional protein, ODC/AdoMetDC. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. A laboratory model of circulation of the malaria causative agent P. gallinaceum has been used to show that the effect of precocene (antijuvenoid) leads to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infected females developing eggs after blood suction. A cell-free incubation system prepared from asexual erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans, is capable of synthesizing the same spectrum of GPIs as that found in metabolically labelled parasites. The Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite is the causative agent of malaria tropica. The gene of an NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was cloned from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria. This study describes the synergistic interaction of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil (VR) and SR33557 or fantofarone (SR), in reversing chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria, a disease of worldwide importance. Two enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the intraerythrocytic malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum: glutathione disulfide reductase, an antioxidative enzyme, which appears to play an essential role for parasite growth and differentiation, and glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme not occurring in the host erythrocyte. The paper provides evidence that the An. sacharovi females which do not develop mature eggs after blood-sucking on the malaria-infected donor could not be infected by the bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man. Plastid origin of an extrachromosomal DNA molecule from Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. [New models of the circulation of the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium gallinaceum using malarial mosquitoes in the fauna of the USSR]. [Experimental research on the effect of biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria. 3. Algae, fertilizers]. On a model pair Aedes aegypti--Plasmodium gallinaceum in has been shown that changes in the conditions of larvae development caused by the addition into the water medium of the live culture of Synochocystis sp. cyanobacteria or green seaweeds Chlorella vulgaris, acetone extracts from the live culture precipitate or Chlorella powder, as well as nitrogen-containing fertilizer--ammonium chloride did not lower the sensitivity of the imago flying to malaria parasites. The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein. The feasibility was determined of influencing Ae. aegypti sensitivity to bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum by sublethal concentrations of herbicides (ordram and propanide) and fungicides (fundozol and blue vitriol) introduced into the larvae habitation medium or into the imago feed. [An experimental study of the effect of different biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria. 1. Insect development regulators]. It has been shown on the model pair Ae. aegypti-P. gallinaceum that dimilin, an inhibitor of insect chitin synthesis has practically no effect on female sensitivity to malaria agent. [The absence of an action of the pyrethroids deltamethrin and cypermethrin on mosquito susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria]. Mosquitos Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi contact with sublethal doses of deltametrin and cypermetrin pyretroids at larval stage and in grown state, when diet includes sugar with pyretroids, had no influence on the sensitivity of survived females to malaria agents P. gallinaceum and P. berghei. This prompted us to purify and characterize the topoisomerases I and II present in the erythrocytes of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, in order to later use these enzymatic systems in antimalarial drug assays. The problem of drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria and its role in the general system of malaria control are discussed. [Effect of mosquito contact with DDT and their susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria]. [Lack of an effect from repeated blood sucking by mosquitoes on their infectivity with the causative agent of malaria]. The lack of repeated bloodsucking does not affect essentially the infection of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with malaria agent, P. gallinaceum. High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria. BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. The effectiveness of methylene blue (MB) combined with pyrimethamine (PYR), chloroquine (CQ) or quinine (Q) was examined in a classical four-day suppressive test against a causative agent of rodent malaria, Plasmodium berghei. Infection by Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, is currently treated with drug-based therapies, but an increase in drug resistance has led to the need for new methods of treatment. BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate. The 23-megabase genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, contains ∼5300 genes, most of unknown function or lacking homologs in other organisms. Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in Nouakchott and that P. vivax is the principal causative agent. Plasmodium vivax was the main causative agent followed by Plasmodium falciparum. Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa that includes several important human pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. Plasmodium falciparum, the major causative agent of human malaria, contains three separate genomes. Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria, are transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes resulting in over 250 million new infections each year. The genus Plasmodium, causative agent of malaria, of the phylum Apicomplexa, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a circular and/or tandemly repeated linear element of 6 kb, encoding only three protein genes (cox1, cox3, and cob). Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the apicoplast organelle during the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases. For transmission to occur, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must complete a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. FQ is able to overcome the CQ resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. Some lycorine ester derivatives including LT1 were examined for their inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the parasite associated with sleeping sickness, and against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. A three-dimensional structure of histo-aspartic protease (HAP), a pepsin-like enzyme from the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, is suggested on the basis of homologous modeling followed by equilibration by the method of molecular dynamics. BACKGROUND: Understanding gene regulation in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is an important step in deciphering its complex life cycle as well as leading to possible new targets for therapeutic applications. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies on a complex protein-secretion system for protein targeting into numerous subcellular destinations. We have evaluated a technology called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) for high throughput identification and prioritization of novel target antigens from genomic sequence data using the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, as a model.

53551206a0726bee57000001	What is the major adverse effect of adriamycin(doxorubicin)?	It remains to be seen whether inhibition by adriamycin of these systems is related to the severe cardiotoxicity, the major adverse effect of the drug that limits its clinical usefulness. Leukocytopenia was the major adverse effect among patients undergoing systemic THP administration The major adverse effect was bone-marrow suppression; The major adverse effect was bone marrow suppression; Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and can be acute or chronic; chronic cardiotoxicity represents a serious adverse effect that may be lethal due to the development of irreversible, cumulative dose-dependent, congestive cardiomyopathy Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity; in addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting and alopecia are frequent, whereas hepatopathy, characterised by elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently In spite of the routine use of this drug its major adverse effect, the dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, cannot be prevented yet The major adverse effect was myelosuppression Cardiac toxicity is a major adverse effect caused by doxorubicin (DOX) therapy Antioxidative and cardioprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria L. on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity The major adverse effect of DOX treatment in cancer patients is the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure	['Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiac toxicity']

This is the first case of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in the small intestine associated with amyloidosis in Korea MR enterography of small-bowel lymphoma: potential for suggestion of histologic subtype and the presence of underlying celiac disease. We describe the characteristics of small-bowel lymphoma on MR enterography, identifying a number of key features that may help the interpreting radiologist in suggesting the underlying histologic subtype and whether the presence of underlying celiac disease is likely. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Epidemiologic studies dating from the 1950s established its association with gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly small bowel lymphoma. An association between untreated coeliac disease and intestinal malignancy is well described so it is possible that patients with undiagnosed coeliac disease constitute a significant reservoir of preventable gastrointestinal malignancy. An increased incidence of small bowel lymphoma in patients with long-standing celiac sprue is well documented in the literature.

54f9c40ddd3fc62544000001	Which calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase is involved in the activation of the family of NFAT transcription factors (Nuclear Factors of Activated T cells)?	Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin signaling has been implicated in a broad spectrum of developmental processes in a variety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was first defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor nuclear translocation and activation. NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and regulate the transcription of cytokine genes critical for the immune response. The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization.  Calcium activated gene transcription through Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, (NFAT) proteins, is emerging as a ubiquitous mechanism for the control of important physiological processes. Of the five mammalian NFAT isoforms, transcriptional activities of NFATs 1-4 are stimulated by a calcium driven association between the ubiquitous phosphatase calcineurin and the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. Transcription factors of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family are expressed in most immune system cells and in a range of other cell types. Signaling through NFAT is implicated in the regulation of transcription for the immune response and other processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. NFAT normally resides in the cytoplasm, and a key aspect of the NFAT activation pathway is the regulation of its nuclear import by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin.  The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) group of transcription factors is retained in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells. NFAT activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import. This process requires calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT caused by the phosphatase calcineurin. The calcium-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B) functions as a regulator of gene expression in diverse tissues through the dephosphorylation and activation of a family of transcription factors known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Calcineurin, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase, plays a key role in T-cell activation by regulating the activity of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), a family of transcription factors required for the synthesis of several cytokine genes. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which signals to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors, serves as a transducer of calcium signals and is sufficient and necessary for pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Upon activation, Cn directly binds to, and dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors within the cytoplasm allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and participate in the regulation of gene expression. The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin	['Calcineurin', 'CaN', 'phosphatase 2b']
532ff917d6d3ac6a34000038	What histone trimethylation has been associated to RNA splicing?	histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site. ChIP-sequencing data mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone H3K36 trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of alternative splicing regulation. Vezf1 interacts with Mrg15/Mrgbp, a protein that recognizes H3K36 trimethylation, consistent with the role of histone modifications at alternatively spliced sites H2BK123ub1 is also a feature of introns in the yeast genome, and the disruption of this modification alters the intragenic distribution of H3 trimethylation on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which functionally correlates with alternative RNA splicing in humans We investigated whether a causal relationship exists between splicing and chromatin modification by asking whether splice-site mutations affect the methylation of histone H3K36  splicing can also contribute to histone modification, Genome-wide analysis of histone methylation in human cell lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing genes are preferentially marked with histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H3K36me3)   transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined, and that modified nucleosomes with trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone subunit 3 (H3K36me3) are enriched at internal exons and the downstream flanking intronic regions of highly expressed genes methylated H3K4 serves to facilitate the competency of pre-mRNA maturation 	['H3K36me3']

Exon skipping quantification by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients treated with the antisense oligomer eteplirsen. morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658). We also assessed the effect of dystrophin restoration on the expression of the five dystromirs in serum of DMD patients treated systemically for 12 weeks with antisense oligomer eteplirsen that induces skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin gene We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) We also assessed the effect of dystrophin restoration on the expression of the five dystromirs in serum of DMD patients treated systemically for 12 weeks with antisense oligomer eteplirsen that induces skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin gene. Here we describe the development of a Taqman quantitative (q)RT-PCR assay to quantify exon skipping and highlight its use to determine the levels of exon skipping in DMD patients treated intramuscularly with a morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658). In prior open-label studies, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, enabled dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 51. Here we describe the development of a Taqman quantitative (q)RT-PCR assay to quantify exon skipping and highlight its use to determine the levels of exon skipping in DMD patients treated intramuscularly with a morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658).  METHODS: DMD boys aged 7 to 13 years, with confirmed deletions correctable by skipping exon 51 and ability to walk 200 to 400 m on 6 MWT, were randomized to weekly intravenous infusions of 30 or 50 mg/kg/wk eteplirsen or placebo for 24 weeks (n = 4/group).  There was no significant difference in the level of the dystromirs in BMD compared to controls. We also assessed the effect of dystrophin restoration on the expression of the five dystromirs in serum of DMD patients treated systemically for 12 weeks with antisense oligomer eteplirsen that induces skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin gene. The dystromirs were also analysed in muscle biopsies of DMD patients included in a single dose intramuscular eteplirsen clinical trial.  We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of α-sarcoglycan, β-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC).

5324ce779b2d7acc7e00001e	Which drug is considered as the first line treatment of fibromyalgia?	Multimodal approaches seem to be the treatment of choice in fibromyalgia A multidisciplinary program was developed and implemented for patients with fibromyalgia in the primary care setting. The program included education (seven sessions) and physical therapy (25 sessions). Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines.  Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, but only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Valproic acid and its sodium salt (sodium valproate) are antiepileptic drugs that are sometimes used to treat chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, although they are not licensed for this use.  Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pregabalin is, therefore, a valuable option in the first-line treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.	['Pregabalin']
55421398ccca0ce74b000001	What type of DNA repair pathways is initiated by AlkA glycosylase?	The Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein (AlkA) recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair pathway. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two paralogues of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, Mag1p and Mag2p, which share homology with Escherichia coli AlkA. To clarify the function of these redundant enzymes in base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage Escherichia coli alkA tagA double mutants, which are deficient in the repair of alkylated bases. AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, is structurally homologous to endo III. We have now identified a shared active site motif amongst these three proteins. Using this motif as a protein database searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions. Alkylation damage is removed by the action of DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway Enzymatic repair of 5-formyluracil. I. Excision of 5-formyluracil site-specifically incorporated into oligonucleotide substrates by alka protein (Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II). These results suggest that fU present in DNA can be restored by two independent repair pathways, i.e. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS. 3-Methyladenine DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) is a DNA-repair enzyme that removes alkylated bases in DNA via the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. Mismatch formation between 5-formyluracil and guanine during dna replication and its recognition by two proteins involved in base excision repair (AlkA) and mismatch repair (MutS). These results suggest that fU present in DNA can be restored by two independent repair pathways, i.e. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS. Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases removing inappropriate bases from DNA. The Escherichia coli AlkA protein is a base excision repair glycosylase that removes a variety of alkylated bases from DNA. Human alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) and Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine glycosylase (AlkA) are base excision repair glycosylases that recognize and excise a variety of alkylated bases from DNA. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS The Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein (AlkA) recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair pathway Alkylation damage is removed by the action of DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway and protect the sequence information of the genome [3-5] The alkylbase DNA glycosylase, AlkA, initiates repair by removal of the damaged base, whereas endonuclease V, Endo V, hydrolyses the second phosphodiester bond 3' to the lesion Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases removing inappropriate bases from DNA	['base excision repair (BER) pathway']
530cf4c54a5037880c000008	What is the name of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?	Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL.  Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1.  Targeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.  Next, we used this model to study ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development.  Ibrutinib: a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor with outstanding responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown highly encouraging results in phase I/II trials in patients with treatment-naive, relapsed and refractory CLL even in the presence of high risk disease or poor prognostic markers.  The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor.  Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis.  Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy.  More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263).

55242d512c8b63434a000006	Which receptors can be evaluated with the [18F]altanserin?	PURPOSE: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Imaging the cerebral serotonin 2A (5-HT2A ) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out in humans with [(11) C]MDL 100907 and [(18) F]altanserin. The cortical binding of [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin was blocked by ketanserin supporting that both radioligands bind to 5-HT2A receptors in the pig brain. We investigated 94 healthy individuals (60 men, mean age 47.0±18.7, range 23-86) to determine if trait aggression and trait impulsivity were related to frontal cortex 5-HT2A receptor binding (5-HT2AR) as measured with [18F]-altanserin PET imaging.  Two hours after placebo/drug administration, 250 MBq of the 5-HT(2A) receptor selective PET-radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin was administered intravenously as a 30s bolus. These data suggest that the combination of a dexfenfluramine-induced 5-HT release and subsequent assessment of 5-HT(2A) receptor availability with [(18)F]altanserin PET is suitable to measure cortical 5-HT release capacity in the human brain. The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a (5-HT(2A)) selective radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin has been subjected to a quantitative micro-positron emission tomography study in Lister Hooded rats. [(18)F]altanserin is suitable for quantification of 5-HT(2A) receptor availability in rats. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led to the development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([(18)F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (11).  Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led to the development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([(18)F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (11). 5-HT2A antagonists bind to the total pool of receptors, whereas 5-HT2A agonists bind only to the high-affinity functional state of the receptor but may be more important in disease states because the high affinity sites are the ones that transmit the intracellular signals.  Baseline and follow-up partial volume corrected levels of 5-HT2A in four neocortical lobes and the posterior cingulate gyrus were investigated using [18F]altanserin positron emission tomography with a bolus-infusion approach. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent inhibitor of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (8, 9). This led to the development of 3-[2-[4-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([(18)F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (10). We investigated the relationships of gender, mood, impulsivity, aggression and temperament to 5HT(2A) receptor binding in 21 healthy subjects using [18F]altanserin and PET neuroimaging. We, therefore, studied the binding potential of the serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in 8 patients with clinically probable PSP and 13 healthy controls using positron emission tomography.  [(18)F]altanserin is the preferred radiotracer for in-vivo labeling of serotonin 2A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET).  Twenty-one healthy subjects underwent PET scanning with the 5-HT(2A) antagonist, [(18)F]altanserin. METHODS: [(18)F]-Altanserin PET was used to quantify 5-HT(2A) receptors in 12 healthy elderly individuals at baseline and at 2 years in six volumes of interest.  The aim of this feasibility study was to examine whether acute ketamine-induced 5-HT release interferes with the binding of the 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) radioligand [(18)F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET) METHODS: Fifteen women ill with AN (ILL AN) were compared with 29 healthy control women (CW); PET and [11C]WAY100635 were used to assess binding potential (BP) of the 5-HT1A receptor, and [18F]altanserin was used to assess postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor BP. In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable to that of other PET radiotracers and that the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors. [18F]altanserin binding to human 5HT2A receptors is unaltered after citalopram and pindolol challenge. Our data confirmed that [18F]altanserin is a valid tracer for 5HT2 receptors binding studies. PET quantification of 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain: a constant infusion paradigm with [18F]altanserin. In vivo binding of [18F]altanserin to rat brain 5HT2 receptors: a film and electronic autoradiographic study. We used [18F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET) to image serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in humans. Quantification of 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain using [18F]altanserin-PET and the bolus/infusion approach. These findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a radioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors. This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in supporting quantification of the target receptors by positron emission tomography. PURPOSE: To determine the reproducibility of measurements of brain 5-HT2A receptors with an [18F]altanserin PET bolus/infusion approach. 18F]altanserin binding to human 5HT2A receptors is unaltered after citalopram and pindolol challenge. Influence of synaptic serotonin level on [18F]altanserin binding to 5HT2 receptors in man. The aim of the present study is to describe and validate a method for accurate quantification of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptors using [18F]altanserin-positron emission tomography (PET) and the bolus/infusion approach. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable to that of other PET radiotracers and that the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors. These findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a radioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors. Reduced binding of [18F]altanserin to serotonin type 2A receptors in aging: persistence of effect after partial volume correction. Visualisation of loss of 5-HT2A receptors with age in healthy volunteers using [18F]altanserin and positron emission tomographic imaging. Imaging the cerebral serotonin 2A (5-HT2A ) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out in humans with [(11) C]MDL 100907 and [(18) F]altanserin [(18)F]altanserin showed sufficient brain uptake in a distribution pattern consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT(2A) receptors This controlled cross-over PET study aimed to identify brain regions with WM-induced changes in the binding potential (BP(nd)) of the 5-HT2aR antagonist [(18)F]altanserin MZ and [(18) F]altanserin was blocked by ketanserin supporting that both radioligands bind to 5-HT2A receptors in the pig brain PET was performed by using [18F]altanserin to evaluate 5-HT2A receptor binding in 11 elderly patients with depression (four men, seven women; mean age = 65.0 years, SD = 5.5); nine Alzheimer's disease patients, including three with concurrent depression (two men, seven women; mean age = 69.7 years, SD = 5.0); and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (four men, six women; mean age = 69.8 years, SD = 5.0) While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in supporting quantification of the target receptors by positron emission tomography To this end, the regional distribution and intrasubject test-retest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were measured as important steps in the further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor Our data confirmed that [18F]altanserin is a valid tracer for 5HT2 receptors binding studies.

54e0ba781388e8454a000011	Where is the metaxin complex localized?	 The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif. Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1.  TOM20 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), METAXIN, and mtOM64 (outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD).  The outer membrane protein METAXIN was characterized to play a role in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins and likely plays a role in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin exists as a complex with SAM50, metaxins 1 and 2, coiled-coil-helix coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 3 and 6 and DnaJC11.  The functional role of this new complex is uncertain. However, a role in protein import related to maintenance of mitochondrial structure is suggested as mitofilin helps regulate mitochondrial morphology and at least four of the associated proteins (metaxins 1 and 2, SAM50 and CHCHD3) have been implicated in protein import, while DnaJC11 is a chaperone-like protein that may have a similar role. We conclude that the pathway of VDAC biogenesis in human mitochondria involves the TOM complex, Sam50 and metaxins, and that it is evolutionarily conserved. Functional analysis of human metaxin in mitochondrial protein import in cultured cells and its relationship with the Tom complex. Metaxin is an outer membrane protein of mammalian mitochondria which is suggested to be involved in protein import into the organelle. Metaxin 1 interacts with metaxin 2, a novel related protein associated with the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane. In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria.  . Metaxin 2 in intact mitochondria was susceptible to digestion with proteinase K, indicating that metaxin 2 is located on the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. metaxin gene (Mtx), which encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane import protein. Metaxin is a component of a preprotein import complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion.	['To the outer mitochondrial membrane.']
5335f053d6d3ac6a34000055	How can the expression of SerH3 immobilization antigen be regulated?	mRNA stability plays a major role in regulating the temperature-specific expression of a Tetrahymena thermophila surface protein. The presence of specific proteins (known as immobilization antigens) on the surface of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is under environmental regulation. A temperature shift from 40 to 28 degrees C rapidly induced expression of a specific immobilization antigen at the cell surface in Tetrahymena thermophila.  Expression of each allele is regulated by temperature-sensitive mRNA stability. H mRNAs are stable at <36 degrees but are unstable at >36 degrees.  In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of the temperature-specific surface protein SerH3 is controlled primarily by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of its mRNA.  we studied SerH3-ts1, a temperature-sensitive allele of the temperature-regulated SerH3 gene normally expressed from 20-36 degrees.  In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of a temperature-specific surface protein known as SerH3 is primarily controlled by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of the mRNA that encodes this protein.  The expression of Tetrahymena surface proteins serotype H3 (SerH3) and serotype T (SerT) is under environmental regulation. SerH3 is expressed when cells are incubated between the temperatures of 20 and 35 degrees C, while SerT is expressed when cells are grown at temperatures above 35 degrees C.  The surfaces of Tetrahymena thermophila cells grown between 20 and 35 degrees C are covered by one or more variants of H antigens.  SerH3, a Tetrahymena thermophila gene encoding a temperature-regulated surface antigen. In the holotrich Tetrahymena thermophila five alternative cell surface immobilization proteins (i-antigens) are expressed under different conditions of temperature (L, H, T) and culture media (I, S).

Chronic Cerebro-Spinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) has been proposed to be associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Zamboni et al reported significant improvement in neurological outcomes in MS patients who underwent Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) Our open-label study included 94 MS patients who fulfilled ultrasound sonographic criteria required for CCSVI.

53148a07dae131f847000002	Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?	Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary among affected individuals and seem to be partially dependent on nutritional iodide intake. Elucidation of the molecular basis of Pendred syndrome and the function of pendrin has provided unexpected novel insights into the pathophysiology of the inner ear, thyroid hormone synthesis, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange in the kidney. Thyroid goiter was found in 46.5% of cases. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter. From age 15 years, her thyroid gland showed progressive enlargement accompanied by elevation of serum thyroglobulin reaching 10-fold the normal amount.  In summary, a molecularly confirmed PS patient showed goiter progression accompanied by elevated serum thyroglobulin and increased thyroidal iodine uptake, but normal serum TSH levels and normal iodine organification. A coherent organization of differentiation proteins is required to maintain an appropriate thyroid function in the Pendred thyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial organification defect of iodide.  The clinical phenotype of patients with Pendred syndrome and the fact that pendrin can mediate iodide efflux in transfected cells suggest that this anion exchanger may be involved in mediating iodide efflux into the follicular lumen, a key step in thyroid hormone biosynthesis.  Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapidly increase pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid cells.  These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it may have a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, coding for the anion transporter pendrin, are responsible for Pendred syndrome, characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness and dyshormonogenic goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial defect in iodide organification. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary and appear to depend on nutritional iodide intake.  Pendrin is mainly expressed in the thyroid, the inner ear, and the kidney. In the thyroid, pendrin localizes to the apical membrane of thyrocytes, where it may be involved in mediating iodide efflux.  Mutations of SLC26A4 cause an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, nonsyndromic deafness, and deafness as part of Pendred syndrome. SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney.  Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister. Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndromes, e.g. Pendred syndrome (PS) and resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct bilaterally. The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a diagnosis of PS. This is the first report of the cooccurrence, in the same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment. Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. Biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene lead to Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Thyroidectomy in a patient with multinodular dyshormonogenetic goitre--a case of Pendred syndrome confirmed by mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene. We report a young woman with genetically confirmed Pendred syndrome and discuss the current therapeutic strategies of dyshormonogenetic goitre. Management of a patient with Pendred syndrome requires careful follow-up and regular imaging of the thyroid.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment, presence of goiter, and a partial defect in iodide organification, which may be associated with insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis. Goiter development and development of hypothyroidism are variable and depend on nutritional iodide intake. Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and a partial iodine organification defect.  Levels of thyroid hormones were essentially normal in all patients: 2 patients had goiters and/or elevated serum thyroglobulin levels, whereas 2 other patients had positive thyroid antibodies and a positive perchlorate discharge test.  Pendred syndrome, defined as the constellation of goiter, sensori-neural hearing loss, and positive perchlorate discharge test, is the most frequent cause of congenital deafness.  Presuming the classic triad as the gold standard, we compared MRI findings in six such defined patients with six cases having goiter, hearing loss, and normal perchlorate discharge test.  For over 100 years after the first description of the disorder, the molecular pathology underlying the deafness and thyroid pathology in Pendred syndrome (PS) remained unknown.  We review the literature to identify genetic defects involved in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from circulation into the thyroid cell, defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell to the follicular lumen (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification. Among those causing dyshormonogenesis, the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes were initially described, and more recently PDS (Pendred syndrome), NIS (sodium iodide symporter), and THOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2) gene defects.  Among permanent CH cases, those with a goitre (n = 27) had an iodine organification defect (n = 10), Pendred syndrome (n = 1), a defect of thyroglobulin synthesis (n = 8), or a defect of sodium iodine symporter (n = 1), and in seven patients no aetiology could be determined. Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid.  Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations.  The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Two patients were hypothyroid, two individuals were euthyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and thyroid goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association between sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid swelling or goitre and is likely to be the most common form of syndromic deafness.  Pendred syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter).

KCNQ1 is associated with two different entities of LQTS, the autosomal-dominant Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), and the autosomal-recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) characterized by bilateral deafness Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by sensorineural deafness, QT prolongation, abnormal T waves, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and autosomal recessive inheritance. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterised by profound congenital sensorineural deafness and prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, representing abnormal ventricular repolarisation. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (MIM 220400; JLNS), is a rare form of profound congenital deafness combined with syncopal attacks and sudden death due to prolonged QTc; it is an autosomal recessive trait.  Different mutations in KVLQT1 cause the dominant Romano-Ward (RW) syndrome and the recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome, which, in addition to cardiac abnormalities, includes congenital deafness.  The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, deafness, and autosomal-recessive inheritance, and the Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by a prolonged QT interval, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and no deafness.

To study CTCF multivalency in vivo, we define ZF binding requirements at ∼50,000 genomic sites in primary lymphocytes.

534427f8aeec6fbd07000009	Are most driver gene mutations synonymous or non-synonymous?	Therefore, this study highlights the need for multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of expressed driver mutations. Whole genome sequencing of the index liver metastasis identified 44 non-synonymous somatic mutations in 42 genes (0.85 mutation/MB) and a large hemizygous deletion in the ATRX gene which has been recently reported in neuroblastoma. In addition, we show that NetDiseaseSNP discriminates cancer driver and passenger mutations satisfactorily. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several disease/neutral datasets as well as on cancer driver/passenger mutation datasets and can thus be used to pinpoint and prioritize plausible disease candidates among nsSNPs for further investigation. Moreover, we find that a large fraction of the driver mutations are neither located in conserved functional sites, nor responsible for structural stability, but rather regulate protein activity through allosteric transitions, protein-protein interactions, or protein-nucleic acid interactions. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify novel non-synonymous somatic mutations in squamous cell lung cancer. We identified 101 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) including 77 non-synonymous SNVs (67 missense and 10 nonsense mutations) and 11 INDELs causing frameshifts. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways). A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency.	['non-synonymous']

51387022bee46bd34c000002	Which is the process that Conserved noncoding elements mostly regulate?	Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development. Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes. These results suggest important roles for SINEs in the development of the mammalian neuronal network, a part of which was initiated with the exaptation of AmnSINE1 in a common mammalian ancestor. Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation. The majority of tetrapod-specific UCEs are noncoding and associated with genes involved in regulation of transcription and development. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development	['Development']
56df03c751531f7e3300000a	Which properties of the mRNA does N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affect?	N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naïve pluripotency-promoting transcripts.  Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification Monitoring m6A levels upon WTAP depletion allowed the definition of accurate and near single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and their classification into WTAP-dependent and -independent sites. WTAP-dependent sites are located at internal positions in transcripts, topologically static across a variety of systems we surveyed, and inversely correlated with mRNA stability, consistent with a role in establishing "basal" degradation rates. Methylations of adenosine residues (m6A) in pre-mRNA are important for formation of late simian virus 40 mRNAs The data argues for a role of internal m6A moieties in modulating the processing-linked transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of nontransformed cells.  N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) residues, which are found internally in viral and cellular mRNA populations at the sequences Apm6ApC and Gpm6ApC, have been proposed to play a role in mRNA processing and transport. The role of Fat Mass and Obesity-associated protein (FTO) and its substrate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA processing and adipogenesis remains largely unknown. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common modification of mRNA with potential roles in fine-tuning the RNA life cycle. The results of that study and of experiments using inhibitors of methylation suggest that m6A might be involved in mRNA processing events.  Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known.   The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors, MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit (MT-A70). The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known.	['mRNA stability']
56c8274f5795f9a73e00000d	Which type of cells is affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?	Activation of microglia, CNS resident immune cells, is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons. We report that both small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 1 and SUMO2/3 modify ALS-linked SOD1 mutant proteins at lysine 75 in a motoneuronal cell line, the cell type affected in ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by ascending muscle weakness, atrophy and paralysis. Early muscle abnormalities that precede motor neuron loss in ALS may destabilize neuromuscular junctions, and we have previously demonstrated alterations in myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) expression in vivo and in the activation of myofiber-associated skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) in the mouse model of ALS (SOD1-G93A). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In the ALS motor neurons, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is dislocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm and forms inclusions, suggesting that loss of a nuclear function of TDP-43 may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. Development of an in vitro model system for ALS is expected to help in obtaining novel insights into disease mechanisms and discovery of therapeutics. We report the establishment of an in vitro FALS model from human embryonic stem cells overexpressing either a wild-type (WT) or a mutant SOD1 (G93A) gene and the evaluation of the phenotypes and survival of the spinal motor neurons (sMNs), which are the neurons affected in ALS patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease and evidence from mice expressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing SOD1 mutations suggest that neurodegeneration is a non-cell autonomous process where microglial cells influence disease progression In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting the motoneurones of the central nervous system (CNS), stem cell-based therapy aims to replace dying host motoneurones by transplantation of cells in disease-affected regions In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity is traditionally thought to be the result of degeneration of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, although degeneration of other neuronal types, in particular serotonergic neurons, might also represent a cause of spasticity.  Stem cell research raises hopes for incurable neurodegenerative diseases. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting the motoneurones of the central nervous system (CNS), stem cell-based therapy aims to replace dying host motoneurones by transplantation of cells in disease-affected regions.

5545e65bd355485447000001	Patients of which disease could be treated by utilizing knowledge obtained from experiments suppressing TDP-43 toxicity in yeast?	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS	['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)']
56f3faed09dd18d46b000002	What is the mechanism of viroid replication?	Together with the specific alpha-amanitin sensitivity of viroid replication observed in vivo, these findings suggest that viroids replicate by an entirely novel mechanism in which infecting viroid RNA molecules are copied by the host enzyme which is normally responsible for the synthesis of nuclear precursors to messenger RNA In vitro synthesis of complementary RNA produces distinct transcripts larger than unit length thus reflecting the in vivo mechanism of viroid replication. This mechanism could account for the origin of viroids and also RNA viruses, whereby modules of genetic information may have undergone repeated exchange between RNA pathogens and the RNA of their hosts. The replication of many viral and subviral pathogens as well as the amplification of certain cellular genes proceeds via a rolling circle mechanism. Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation. Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent.  Subsequently, an in vitro selection procedure based on a model rolling circle replication assay was developed. Replication of these minimal genomes, composed exclusively by a circular RNA of 246-401 nt, occurs in the nucleus (family Pospiviroidae) or in the chloroplast (family Avsunviroidae) by an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism with three steps: (1) synthesis of longer-than-unit strands catalyzed by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases recruited and redirected to transcribe RNA templates, (2) cleavage to unit-length, which in family Avsunviroidae is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes, and (3) circularization through an RNA ligase or autocatalytically. Viroid replication: rolling-circles, enzymes and ribozymes. Viroid replication proceeds through an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism with three steps that, with some variations, operate in both polarity strands: i) synthesis of longer-than-unit strands catalyzed by either the nuclear RNA polymerase II or a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, in both instances redirected to transcribe RNA templates, ii) cleavage to unit-length, which in the family Avsunviroidae is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes embedded in both polarity strands, while in the family Pospiviroidae the oligomeric RNAs provide the proper conformation but not the catalytic activity, and iii) circularization. Viroid replication is entirely dependent on host transcription machinery, and their replication/accumulation in the infected cells can activate RNA silencing-a host defense mechanism that targets the viroid itself.  Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation. Viroids replicate via a rolling circle mechanism, and cleavage/ligation requires extensive rearrangement of the highly base-paired native structure. Viroids are not translated; they are replicated by a host enzyme (or enzymes) (probably RNA polymerase II) via oligomeric RNA intermediates by a rolling circle mechanism. We hypothesize that the intramolecular self-ligation which produces circular conformers may contribute to the circularization step of the rolling circle replication, while the intermolecular non-enzymatic ligation is a potential mechanism for the sequence reassortment of viroids and viroid-like species Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) contains a viroid-like circular RNA that is presumed to replicate via a rolling circle replication mechanism mediated by cellular RNA polymerases Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent.  Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) contains a viroid-like circular RNA that is presumed to replicate via a rolling circle replication mechanism mediated by cellular RNA polymerases. However, the exact mechanism of rolling circle replication for HDV RNA and viroids is not clear.  Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent. In this study, we initially revisited the determination of the replication initiation sites of peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd).

531464a6e3eabad021000014	Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?	The diagnosis of MLS was confirmed by genetic testing showing a hemizygous mutation of XK gene.  We performed a comprehensive mutation screen of VPS13A and XK, the gene responsible for ChAc and MLS, respectively, in 85 mood disorder subjects and XK in 86 schizophrenia subjects and compared the variants to 100 or more control alleles. We hypothesized that because the XK gene is X-linked, it would be easy to identify spontaneously arising red cells with a phenotype resembling the McLeod syndrome, which results from inherited XK mutations.  Identification and characterization of a novel XK splice site mutation in a patient with McLeod syndrome. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations in the XK gene whose product is expressed at the red blood cell (RBC) surface but whose function is currently unknown. The responsible XK mutation was characterized at the mRNA level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identified by genomic DNA sequencing, and verified by allele-specific PCR. A novel XK splice site mutation (IVS1-1G>A) has been identified in a McLeod patient who has developed hematologic, neuromuscular, and neurologic symptoms. This is the first reported example of a XK point mutation affecting the 3' acceptor splice site of Intron 1, and it was demonstrated that this mutation indeed induces aberrant splicing of XK RNA and lack of XK protein at the RBC membrane. The detailed characterization at the molecular biology level of this novel XK splice site mutation associated with the clinical description of the patient contributes to a better understanding of the phenotype-genotype correlation in the McLeod syndrome. Genetic test revealed a R133X mutation of the XK gene, confirming the McLeod syndrome. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a small deletion in the XK gene (938-942delCTCTA), which has been already described in a North American patient of Anglo-Saxon descent and a Japanese family, presenting with seizures, muscle atrophy or chorea yet absence of psychiatric features. A variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (XK) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of XK, and different deletion mutations.  The first case had been authenticated as a genuine McLeod both by serology and by genotyping (R222G missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in XK (IVS2+5G>A) and by serology exhibited very weak Kx antigen and no detectable Kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique.  Despite documented McLeod phenotype on RBCs, and identified mutations of XK, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest MLS.  The different XK mutations may have different effects upon the XK gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype. Insights into extensive deletions around the XK locus associated with McLeod phenotype and characterization of two novel cases. The McLeod phenotype is derived from various forms of XK gene defects that result in the absence of XK protein, and is defined hematologically by the absence of Kx antigen, weakening of Kell system antigens, and red cell acanthocytosis.  MLS is an X-linked multi-system disorder caused by absence of XK alone, or when the disorder is caused by large deletions, it may be accompanied with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), chronic granulomatous disease (CYBB), retinitis pigmentosa (RPGR), and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC).  Case 1 has greater than 1.12 million base-pairs (mb) deletion around the XK locus with 7 genes affected. The McLeod Syndrome, one of the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects.  Linkage analysis and sequencing revealed a XK gene mutation (McLeod syndrome). McLeod syndrome: life-long neuropsychiatric disorder due to a novel mutation of the XK gene. DNA studies demonstrated a single-base deletion at position 172 in exon 1 of the XK gene, giving rise to a premature stop codon at position 129 in exon 2. McLeod syndrome resulting from a novel XK mutation. MLS is caused by hemizygosity for mutations in the XK gene.  The patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an XK0 allele. The molecular basis of MLS in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion that includes exon 2 of the XK gene. This confirms that the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asymptomatic, also has the XK0 allele and is therefore likely to develop MLS. McLeod phenotype associated with a XK missense mutation without hematologic, neuromuscular, or cerebral involvement. XK gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased.  Known disease-causing XK gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated XK protein devoid of the Kell-protein binding site. Although the E327K missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of McLeod syndrome, the mutated XK protein seemed to be largely functional. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of XK and Kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in McLeod syndrome. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod.  We present six males (aged 29 to 60 years), with proven XK mutations, to discuss the chorea associated with McLeod syndrome. A spontaneous novel XK gene mutation in a patient with McLeod syndrome. Investigation of the patient's XK gene revealed a novel TGG- to-TAG transition at position 1023 in exon 3.  It is caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein, a putative membrane transport protein of yet unknown function.  Here, we present an immunohistochemical study in skeletal muscle of normal controls and a McLeod patient with a XK gene point mutation (C977T) using affinity-purified antibodies against XK and Kell proteins. The McLeod syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein. We describe a family with a novel point mutation in the XK gene consisting of a C to T base transition at nucleotide position 977, introducing a stop codon. he XK gene had a point mutation in the donor splice site of intron 1 (G>C).  Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed the mutation was a single C-nucleotide insertion at codon 151 in exon 2 of the XK gene, which resulted in a 3'-frameshift. It is caused by XK gene defects and may include large deletions in the Xp21 region.  We report a novel mutation in the XK gene (XK) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome.  The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (T) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK. The gene termed SRPX (sushi-repeat-containing protein, x chromosome) is deleted in an RP patient who also suffers from chronic granulomatous disease and McLeod syndrome.   The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites.

54fc91e96ad7dcbc12000001	PBT2 has been tested for which disorder?	PBT2 improved cognition in a phase II clinical trial with AD patients, and further clinical testing is currently underway. In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.  The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia.  The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight the emerging notion that metal chaperones, such as PBT2 (Prana Biotechnology), modulate a variety of critical pathways affecting key aspects of the AD cascade to provide a more "holistic" approach to the treatment of this disease. The Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2 promotes amyloid-β degradation and GSK3 phosphorylation via a metal chaperone activity. The leading compound in this class of therapeutic, PBT2, improved cognition in a clinical trial with AD patients.  Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD. Metalloproteinase modifiers such as PBT2 may be useful AD therapies, but current evidence gives no support to their immediate use in pre-symptomatic AD. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials.  PBT2 rapidly improves cognition in Alzheimer's Disease: additional phase II analyses.  A recent Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta42, and significantly improved executive function on a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within 12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD.  These findings further encourage larger-scale testing of PBT2 for AD. Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Experimental treatments potentially useful for Alzheimer's disease include dimebon, PBT2 and etanercept; the safety and efficacy of the Alzheimer's vaccine remains to be proven, and growth hormone secretagogue and tarenflurbil are likely ineffective.  The recent report of positive results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of PBT2, a novel drug that targets amyloid-beta-metal interactions, underscores the value of abnormal transition metal metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. It has performed very satisfactorily in toxicology and Phase I clinical trials and is advancing as a disease-modifying candidate drug for Alzheimer's disease. Future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness. Small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions (e.g., PBT2) are currently advancing through clinical trials and show increasing promise as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease based on the "metal hypothesis." Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD.	["Alzheimer's disease"]
511a3573df1ebcce7d000018	How many tissue kallikrein genes are present in the human genome?	Tissue kallikreins are a group of closely related serine proteinases that are represented by multigene families in mice and rats. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. The human tissue Kallikrein family consists of 15 genes with the majority shown to be differentially expressed in cancers and/or indicators of cancer prognosis. The 15 members of the kallikrein-related serine peptidase (KLK) family have diverse tissue-specific expression profiles and putative proteolytic functions. The 15 human and 24 mouse kallikreins have been implicated in pathophysiology of brain, kidney, and respiratory and reproductive systems and often are used as cancer biomarkers. Kallikrein gene families have been identified previously in genomes of the human, the mouse, and the rat, and individual kallikrein-like genes have been found in many more species. The human tissue kallikrein family of serine proteases (hK1-hK15 encoded by the genes KLK1-KLK15) is involved in several cancer-related processes. The tissue kallikrein gene family consists of 15 genes tandemly arranged on human chromosome 19q13.4. Human kallikreins are a cluster of 15 serine protease genes located in the chromosomal band 19q13.4, a non-randomly rearranged region in many solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer. Tissue kallikrein genes (KLKs) are found on chromosome 19q13.3-4 as a gene cluster encoding 15 different serine proteases. Project to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human KLK genes in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues and cell lines. Novel kallikrein genes were cloned recently, and it was shown that the human kallikrein family contains 15 genes tandemly aligned on chromosomal locus 19q13.3-q13.4. The human kallikrein gene family consists of 15 serine proteases. We have recently characterized the human kallikrein gene locus on chromosome 19q13.4, which includes 15 kallikrein genes. The human tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs), encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome, are secreted serine proteases with diverse expression patterns and physiological roles. that forms the largest cluster of contiguous protease genes in the human genome. Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) constitute a family of 15 highly conserved serine proteases encoded by the largest uninterrupted cluster of protease-encoding genes within the human genome. In this review, we describe the organization of the kallikrein locus and the structure of kallikrein genes and proteins. The human tissue kallikrein gene family is the largest contiguous family of proteases in the human genome, containing 15 genes. Human tissue kallikrein genes represent the largest contiguous group of proteases within the human genome. Human tissue kallikreins (hKs), which are encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome, are secreted serine proteases with diverse expression patterns and physiological roles.

56c5c7915795f9a73e000004	Where does CTCF colocalize with cohesin?	In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.  In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.  Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels. Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.   To determine the functional importance of the binding of CTCF and cohesins at the three imprinted loci, CTCF and cohesins were depleted in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Results of these experiments demonstrate an unappreciated role for CTCF and cohesins in the repression of imprinted genes in somatic cells. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We conclude that cohesin subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene regulation and chromatin organization. Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Here, we show that ATRX, MeCP2, and cohesin, chromatin regulators implicated in ATR-X, RTT, and CdLS syndromes, respectively, interact in the brain and colocalize at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) with preferential binding on the maternal allele. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle.  ChIP sequencing was performed on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at ~60 sites throughout the V(H) region and 2 other sites within the Igh locus.  Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus.  CTCF colocalizes with cohesin but not RNA Polymerase II.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci.

550e828c71445a662f000002	Which molecule is targeted by the drug Gevokizumab?	Detailed mechanistic analysis of gevokizumab, an allosteric anti-IL-1β antibody with differential receptor-modulating properties. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism.  These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases. Most recently, rising evidence reports on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab, while use of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents (anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab), IL-6 blockers (tocilizumab), and rituximab (depleting anti-CD20 antibody) is also increasing. One target-two different binding modes: structural insights into gevokizumab and canakinumab interactions to interleukin-1β. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies.  Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1β bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1β signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1β.  In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1β and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechanisms of IL-1β pathway attenuation. Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody.  Interleukin-1β-regulating antibody XOMA 052 (gevokizumab) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of resistant uveitis of Behcet's disease: an open-label pilot study. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a recombinant humanised anti-interleukin 1β antibody, in Behçet's disease patients with uveitis.  Gevokizumab, an anti-IL-1β mAb for the potential treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. XOMA is developing gevokizumab (XOMA-052), an IgG2 humanized mAb against human IL-1β, for the potential treatment of these diseases. Gevokizumab has a high affinity for IL-1β and a long t1/2, which would allow for once-monthly dosing and offer a considerable advantage for patients over agents requiring more frequent dosing. To meet these challenges, we developed XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a potent anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody that was designed in silico and humanized using Human Engineering™ technology.  In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies. Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody.

54f608f85f206a0c06000007	What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?	Although a repressor could function by recruiting just a single co-repressor, many can recruit more than one, with Drosophila Brinker (Brk) recruiting the co-repressors CtBP and Groucho (Gro),  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila corepressor required by numerous DNA-binding repressors, many of which are distributed in gradients and provide positional information during development.  Drosophila Groucho (Gro) is the founding member of a family of metazoan corepressors.  Tcf3 requires corepressor molecules such as Groucho (Gro)/TLE and HDAC1 for activity.  We identified the transcriptional co-repressor xTLE1/Groucho as an EphrinB1 interacting protein.  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor Transcriptional co-repressors of the Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) family regulate the expression of a variety of genes and are involved in numerous developmental processes in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. The proteins termed TLE in humans, Grg in mice and Groucho in Drosophila constitute a family of transcriptional corepressors.  Groucho (Gro)/TLE, a global developmental corepressor,  The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences results in transcriptional repression.

56c048acef6e39474100001c	Which enzyme is inhibited by Imetelstat?	The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.  Telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L) limits the lifespan of human pancreatic cancer cells. GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase.  We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and phosphorylation of TP53. The activity of imetelstat as a single agent suggests that further studies of telomerase inhibitors in combination with other agents may be warranted.  Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of telomerase inhibition on proliferation and tumorigenicity in established cell lines (BXD-1425EPN, R254), a primary TIC line (E520) and xenograft models of pediatric ependymoma.  PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase.  Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Imetelstat inhibited proliferation and self-renewal by shortening telomeres and inducing senescence in vitro. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. The GBM tumor-initiating cells were treated with imetelstat and examined for the effects on telomerase activity levels, telomere length, proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation. We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT. This enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not in the majority of normal somatic cells. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.  Telomerase antagonist imetelstat inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth and increases radiation-induced DNA breaks. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential.  When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells.  Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer.  In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs.  Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.  BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity.  Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis.  Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. 	['telomerase']

56ffd805cf1c32585100000a	Which is the main difference between Alu and B1 repeats?	The mouse B1 sequence is congruent to 130 nucleotides long and shows homology with the monomeric units of the dimeric 300-nucleotide primate sequence.  Here we show that some members of the mouse B1 Alu sequence family encode a small cytoplasmic RNA Alus and B1s are short interspersed repeat elements (SINEs) derived from the 7SL RNA gene. Alus and B1s exist in the cytoplasm as non-coding RNA indicating that they are actively transcribed, but their function, if any, is unknown. B1 (Alu-equivalent) is a murine short interspersed element whose amplification probably involved an RNA intermediate The data demonstrate that a limited set of B1 sequences are expressed as processed RNA polymerase III-transcripts of a high degree of structural conservation.  B1 is a murine homolog of the human SINE Alu These RNAs have conserved a secondary structure motif also present in signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA despite substantial sequence divergence, whereas random B1 and Alu sequences have not. The modern B1 elements are similar to the left Alu monomer, but with a 9 bp deletion and a 29 bp duplication. A master sequence related to a free left Alu monomer (FLAM) at the origin of the B1 family in rodent genomes.  The core sequences of these elements contain pol III promoters but must rely on fortuitous downstream oligo(dT) tracts for terminator function. We show that a B1-Alu gene differs markedly from a classical pol III gene (tRNAiMet) in terminator sequence requirements Most human Alu and murine B1 repeats are unique. Alu and b1 repeats have been selectively retained in the upstream and intronic regions of genes of specific functional classes Alu and B1 repeats are mobile elements that originated in an initial duplication of the 7SL RNA gene prior to the primate-rodent split about 80 million years ago and currently account for a substantial fraction of the human and mouse genome, respectively we present evidence that Alu and B1 elements have been selectively retained in the upstream and intronic regions of genes belonging to specific functional classes. Finally, the unexpected finding that Alu and B1 elements show similar biases in their distribution across functional classes, despite having spread independently in their respective genomes, further supports our claim that the extant instances of Alu and B1 elements are the result of positive selection. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element. A statistically reliable slowing down in the evolutionary rates of one of two monomers for the human Alu repeats has been proved. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.

533ba85ffd9a95ea0d000008	What is the frequency of mutations induced spontaneously through Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis?	The mutation frequency increased linearly with MNU or ENU concentration (0.01--2.0 mM); mean values were 2800 and 840 mutants per 10(6) clonable cells per mM, respectively The mutation frequency induced by a 400 mg/kg dosage of ethylnitrosourea is 12 times the maximal mutation frequency achievable with a single exposure to x-rays and 36 times that reported for procarbazine, the most effective chemical mutagen previously known for mouse stem-cell spermatogonia Specific locus tests designed to detect recessive mutations showed that ENU is the most efficient mutagen in mouse with an approximate mutation rate of 1 in 1,000 gametes. Theoretical considerations and empirical analysis suggest that the per-base mutation frequency for a fractionated-dose treatment protocol is on the order of 1 sequence change per 10(5) bp Unlike spontaneous chromosome damage, spontaneous mutant frequencies did not differ significantly among homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice (3.2 x 10(-5), 3.1 x 10(-5), and 3.1 x 10(-5), respectively; P > 0.05) The ENU-induced mutation frequency in Blmtm3Brd homozygous, heterozygous, and wild mice were 54 x 10(-5), 35 x 10(-5), and 25 x 10(-5) mutants/plaques, respectively mutation frequencies per nucleotide based on mutant spectra from this study and published literature.

58a2e5f760087bc10a000007	Which is the primary protein component of Lewy bodies?	Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn), the primary protein component in Lewy body inclusions of patients with Parkinson's disease, arises when the normally soluble intrinsically disordered protein converts to amyloid fibrils.  The primary structural component of Lewy bodies are fibrils composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, a highly conserved 140 amino acid protein that is predominantly expressed in neurons and which may play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Fibrillar α-synuclein (AS) is the major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.  Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's Disease.  For alpha-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson's disease, we have used a combination of ssNMR and biochemical data to identify the key region for self-aggregation of the protein as residues 77-82 (VAQKTV).  The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.  Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Alpha-synuclein forms the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the defining neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. á-Synuclein is the major protein component of Lewy bodies--the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). alpha-Synuclein and ubiquitin are two Lewy body protein components that may play antagonistic roles in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies. The segregation of alpha-synuclein to Lewy body peripheral domain is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein is continually deposited onto Lewy bodies. Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p Whereas approximately 550 proteins were identified in the LB-enriched sample by mass spectrometry, quantitative comparison with the control sample revealed that approximately 40 proteins were co-enriched with alpha-synuclein, the major component in Lewy bodies This apparent conflict in protein levels might have arisen from examining Lewy body disease cases with coexisting Alzheimer-type pathologies.To assess whether ATP13A2 levels in Lewy body disease are modified by Alzheimer-type β-amyloid deposition, we evaluated cases of pure PD and pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for changes in ATP13A2, α-synuclein and β-amyloid protein levels in cortical regions with and without Lewy bodies.In all Lewy body disease cases, we identified decreased ATP13A2 protein levels that correlated with increases in both α-synuclein and β-amyloid Partial colocalization was observed between ATP13A2 and α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, whereas ATP13A2 did not colocalize with pathological β-amyloid deposition.Our data show that patients with Lewy body diseases have an overall deficit in ATP13A2 protein levels, with the remaining protein being more insoluble and partially redistributing towards Lewy bodies Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p. Human α-synuclein is a small-sized, natively unfolded protein that in fibrillar form is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. α-Synuclein is a small synaptic protein that has been linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also the primary component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark neuropathology found in the brain of sporadic and familial PD patients. The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. α-Synuclein is an abundant presynaptic protein and a primary component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease. The natively disordered protein alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the cellular hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is the principal protein component of Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Lewy bodies and coarse Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Lewy bodies and coarse Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. This study demonstrates for the first time that extensive and thin alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions are present in the axonal processes of neurons. á-Synuclein is the major protein component of Lewy bodies--the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Its accumulation into intracellular aggregates is implicated in the process of Lewy body formation. Filamentous alpha-synuclein inclusions link multiple system atrophy with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component. Microtubule-associated protein 1B is a component of cortical Lewy bodies and binds alpha-synuclein filaments. These findings indicate that alpha-synuclein forms the major filamentous component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.. The protein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy bodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD.

5891f9e549702f2e01000002	Willis-Ekbom disease is also known as?	Defining the phenotype of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED): a clinical and polysomnographic study. Clinical features variability between familial and sporadic restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) has been previously reported. With this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of 400 RLS/WED patients.  "Emplotted Narratives" and Structured "Behavioral Observations" Supporting the Diagnosis of Willis-Ekbom Disease/Restless Legs Syndrome in Children with Neurodevelopmental Conditions. BACKGROUND: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) seems to be a frequent cause of intractable chronic insomnia (ICI) but is under-recognized in children/adolescents with neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs), as many patients do not have the ability to express the underlying "urge-to-move".  Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), is a common movement disorder characterised by an uncontrollable urge to move because of uncomfortable, sometimes painful sensations in the legs with a diurnal variation and a release with movement.  OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that having migraine in middle age is related to late-life parkinsonism and a related disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED).METHODS: The AGES-Reykjavik cohort (born 1907-1935) has been followed since 1967.

5880be1dc872c95565000007	Which enzyme is inhibited by niraparib?	While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles.  Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. We report here that while the activities of the four human sirtuin isoforms SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 are blocked by sirtuin inhibitor Ex527 in vitro, they are unaffected by the seven clinical and commonly used PARP inhibitors niraparib, olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, veliparib, PJ34, and XAV939.  Results from a phase III trial indicate that maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor niraparib is more effective than placebo in slowing the progression of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In vivo anti-tumor activity of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in homologous recombination deficient and proficient ovarian carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have yielded encouraging responses in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), but the optimal treatment setting remains unknown. We assessed the effect of niraparib on HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as the relationship between certain markers of homologous recombination (HR) status, including BRCA1/2 mutations and formation of RAD51 foci after DNA damage, and response of these PDXs to niraparib in vivo. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib.  Background Niraparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1/2 inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients with ovarian cancer. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor, niraparib, sensitizes colorectal cancer cell lines to irinotecan regardless of MSI/MSS status. METHODS: Here we examine the response to niraparib, a potent PARP-1/PARP-2 inhibitor currently under clinical evaluation, in MSI versus microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo.  Several clinical-stage PARP inhibitors, including veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib, have been evaluated for their PARP-trapping activity.  Niraparib: A Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor for the Treatment of Tumors with Defective Homologous Recombination. We describe the rationale for this approach and the design and discovery of niraparib, a potent PARP-1/2 inhibitor with good cell based activity, selectivity for cancer over normal cells, and oral bioavailability.  Niraparib (50 mg/kg) inhibited PARP1 activity in vivo and extended survival of mice with orthotopic pHGA xenografts, when administered before IR (20 Gy, fractionated), relative to control mice (40 vs. 25 days) Niraparib (MK-4827), a novel poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitor, radiosensitizes human lung and breast cancer cells. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor niraparib (MK4827) in BRCA mutation carriers and patients with sporadic cancer: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Niraparib was characterized in a number of preclinical models before moving to phase I clinical trials, where it showed excellent human pharmacokinetics suitable for once a day oral dosing, achieved its pharmacodynamic target for PARP inhibition, and had promising activity in cancer patients.  The aim of this study was to assess niraparib (MK-4827), a novel poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells.  Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function.  Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827) > olaparib (AZD-2281) >> veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug.  Several clinical-stage PARP inhibitors, including veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib, have been evaluated for their PARP-trapping activity. These results indicate that human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective PARP-1 inhibitor, niraparib, in the in vitro setting. Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function. Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827)>olaparib (AZD-2281)>>veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug. Niraparib (50 mg/kg) inhibited PARP1 activity in vivo and extended survival of mice with orthotopic pHGA xenografts, when administered before IR (20 Gy, fractionated), relative to control mice (40 vs. Niraparib: A Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor for the Treatment of Tumors with Defective Homologous Recombination. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor, niraparib, sensitizes colorectal cancer cell lines to irinotecan regardless of MSI/MSS status. Other PARP inhibitors under clinical trials include rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and the "PARP-trapping" BMN-673. The high-throughput screens identified multiple clinical poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitors, such as olaparib (AZD-2281), niraparib (MK-4827) and BMN 673, as being selective for ERCC1 deficiency. Inhibition of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase1 (PARP1) impairs DNA damage repair, and early generation PARP1/2 inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, etc.) have demonstrated clinical proof of concept for cancer treatment. Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827) > olaparib (AZD-2281) >> veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug.

587f760792a5b8ad44000005	Which peak calling algorithm employs mixture model clustering under the hood?	We developed JAMM (Joint Analysis of NGS replicates via Mixture Model clustering): a peak finder that can integrate information from biological replicates, determine enrichment site widths accurately and resolve neighboring narrow peaks. JAMM is a universal peak finder that is applicable to different types of datasets. We show that JAMM is among the best performing peak finders in terms of site detection accuracy and in terms of accurate determination of enrichment sites widths. In addition, JAMM's replicate integration improves peak spatial resolution, sorting and peak finding accuracy.	['JAMM']
589a246078275d0c4a00002a	Which drug was tested in the TEMSO Trial for multiple sclerosis?	Long-term safety and efficacy of teriflunomide: Nine-year follow-up of the randomized TEMSO study. OBJECTIVE: To report safety and efficacy outcomes from up to 9 years of treatment with teriflunomide in an extension (NCT00803049) of the pivotal phase 3 Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial (NCT00134563). CONCLUSIONS: In the TEMSO extension, safety observations were consistent with the core trial, with no new or unexpected AEs in patients receiving teriflunomide for up to 9 years. Teriflunomide, approved on the basis of the two placebo-controlled trials TEMSO and TOWER, demonstrated a reduction in the ARR from 0.54 to 0.37 and from 0.50 to 0.32 respectively.  Using data from pivotal studies of DMF (DEFINE, NCT00420212; CONFIRM, NCT00451451), fingolimod (FREEDOMS, NCT00289978; FREEDOMS II, NCT00355134), and teriflunomide (TEMSO, NCT00134563; TOWER, NCT00751881), we calculated NNTs to prevent any relapse, more severe relapses (such as those leading to hospitalization or requiring intravenous corticosteroids), and disability worsening. METHODS: In September 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the use of teriflunomide, 14 mg and 7 mg once daily, to treat RMS on the basis of the results of a Phase II study and the Phase III TEMSO (Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral) trial.  In the TEMSO and TOWER studies, the 14-mg dose of teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (31% and 36% relative risk reduction compared with placebo, respectively; both P<0.001) and risk of disability progression sustained for 12 weeks (hazard ratio vs placebo 0.70 and 0.69, respectively; both P<0.05). Teriflunomide treatment was also associated with significant efficacy on MRI measures of disease activity in TEMSO; both doses significantly reduced total lesion volume and number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions. The purpose was to summarize US prescribing information for teriflunomide in the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), with reference to clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.In September 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the use of teriflunomide, 14 mg and 7 mg once daily, to treat RMS on the basis of the results of a Phase II study and the Phase III TEMSO (Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral) trial The Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study, demonstrated that teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), disease progression and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, with a favorable safety profile in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) patients.The purpose of this study was to report the effects of teriflunomide on ARR and disability progression in pre-specified subgroups.RMS patients (n=1088) were randomized to placebo or teriflunomide, 7 mg or 14 mg, once daily, for 108 weeks BACKGROUND: The Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study, demonstrated that teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR), disease progression and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, with a favorable safety profile in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) patients.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the effects of teriflunomide on ARR and disability progression in pre-specified subgroups.METHODS: RMS patients (n=1088) were randomized to placebo or teriflunomide, 7 mg or 14 mg, once daily, for 108 weeks.

5880aef4c872c95565000001	What is the target of daratumumab?	Dominantly daratumumab (anti-CD38) and elotuzumab (anti-CS1) showed extraordinary effectiveness in phase I/II trials. In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively. Of these agents, CD38-targeting antibodies have marked single agent activity in extensively pretreated MM, and preliminary results from studies with relapsed/refractory patients have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy when daratumumab and isatuximab are combined with other agents Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Neutralization of the therapeutic CD38 antibody or CD38 denaturation on reagent red blood cells mitigates daratumumab interference with transfusion laboratory serologic tests.  Daratumumab is a fully human anti-CD38 IgG1-κ monoclonal antibody (mAb) currently being evaluated in several Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).  In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. This article focuses on the basic and clinical aspects of several emerging and promising novel MoAbs for MM, such as elotuzumab which targets CS1 and daratumumab which targets CD38.

In this regard, some of these novel agents seem promising, such as monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38 - daratumumab or anti-CS1 - elotuzumab) or the kinesin protein inhibitor Arry-520. This is likely to change within the next few years with a number of mAb therapies being assessed in late stage clinical trials, most notably, the anti-CS-1 mAb, elotuzumab, and the anti-CD38 mAb, daratumumab, which are currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials for MM. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM), represents a promising target for mAb-based immunotherapy.

Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab Monotherapy in Multiple Myeloma. We assessed daratumumab, a novel CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a cell surface protein that is overexpressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Daratumumab, a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

Several drugs targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved or are in the late stages of development. We then focus on the recent breakthrough work concerning the structural basis of the PD-1/PD-Ls interaction and how therapeutic antibodies, pembrolizumab targeting PD-1 and avelumab targeting PD-L1, compete with the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to interrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.  Programed death-1/programed death-ligand 1 expression in lymph nodes of HIV infected patients: results of a pilot safety study in rhesus macaques using anti-programed death-ligand 1 (Avelumab). In addition, we assessed the safety and biological activity of a human anti-PD-L1 antibody (Avelumab) in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. We assessed treatment with avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with stage IV Merkel cell carcinoma that had progressed after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Near infrared photoimmunotherapy with avelumab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody. Here, we describe the efficacy of NIR-PIT, using fully human IgG1 anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), avelumab, conjugated to the photo-absorber, IR700DX, in a PD-L1 expressing H441 cell line, papillary adenocarcinoma of lung. In conclusion, the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab, is suitable as an APC for NIR-PIT. Furthermore, NIR-PIT with avelumab-IR700 is a promising candidate of the treatment of PD-L1-expressing tumors that could be readily translated to humans.

5895bc397d9090f35300000b	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Christianson syndrome?	X-linked Christianson syndrome: heterozygous female Slc9a6 knockout mice develop mosaic neuropathological changes and related behavioral abnormalities. CS is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which encodes a multipass transmembrane sodium (potassium)-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) protein, functional in early recycling endosomes.  A Christianson syndrome-linked deletion mutation (∆(287)ES(288)) in SLC9A6 disrupts recycling endosomal function and elicits neurodegeneration and cell death. BACKGROUND: Christianson Syndrome, a recently identified X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the human gene SLC9A6 encoding the recycling endosomal alkali cation/proton exchanger NHE6.  BACKGROUND: Mutations of SLC9A6 may cause an X-linked clinical syndrome first described by Christianson in 1999 in which affected males exhibited profound intellectual disability, autism, drug-resistant epilepsy, ophthalmoplegia, mild craniofacial dysmorphism, microcephaly, and ataxia. OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6).  Genetic and phenotypic diversity of NHE6 mutations in Christianson syndrome. Mutations in the solute carrier family 9, subfamily A member 6 (SLC9A6) gene, encoding the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) are associated with Christianson syndrome, a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, autistic behavior, early onset seizures and ataxia. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6. Christianson syndrome (CS) is caused by mutations in SLC9A6 and is characterized by severe intellectual disability, absent speech, microcephaly, ataxia, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities.  We report on two children with CS and confirmed mutations in SLC9A6 focusing on neuroimaging findings and review the available literature.

Mutations in SLC9A6 are associated with Christianson syndrome (OMIM 300243), a syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, ataxia and seizures.  This patient broadens the spectrum of SLC9A6 mutations and contributes to the clinical delineation of Christianson syndrome.  The single-gene disorders include Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (TCF4), Christianson syndrome (SLC9A6), Mowat–Wilson syndrome (ZEB2), Kleefstra syndrome (EHMT1), and Rett (MECP2) syndrome. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6.

58b56fe422d3005309000007	Where do the Schwann cells and melanocytes originate from?	The development of the nervous system involves cells remaining within the neural tube (CNS) and a group of cells that delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo called neural crest cells (NCC). These cells are a mesenchymal highly migratory group of cells that give rise to a wide variety of cell derivatives: melanocytes, sensory neurons, bone, Schwann cells, etc.  Cell types with neural crest ancestry consequently comprise a number of specialized varieties, such as ectodermal neurons, melanocytes and Schwann cells, as well as mesodermal osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells.  Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types.  Later, SoxE proteins drive the formation of multiple neural crest derivatives including chondrocytes, melanocytes, and cells of the peripheral nervous system, particularly Schwann cells/peripheral glia.  Melanocytes and Schwann cells are derived from the multipotent population of neural crest cells. The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells. Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types Furthermore, although both populations are initially part of the Foxd3 lineage, hypaxial melanocytes lose Foxd3 at late stages upon separation from the nerve, whereas we recently found that epaxial melanocytes segregate earlier from Foxd3-positive neural progenitors while still residing in the dorsal neural tube.  Reversal of developmental restrictions in neural crest lineages: transition from Schwann cells to glial-melanocytic precursors in vitro. Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells. In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme. Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances. Other already committed cells are the angioblasts forming the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, the neural crest cells differentiating into melanocytes and Schwann cells, and the blood-derived cells like chrondro- or osteoclasts. The dorsal neural tube first generates neural crest cells that exit the neural primordium following an epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion to become sympathetic ganglia, Schwann cells, dorsal root sensory ganglia, and melanocytes of the skin. We show here that neural crest cells arising from the neural tube located at the level of somites 47-53 can differentiate both in vitro and in vivo into melanocytes and Schwann cells but not into neurons. This capacity may be due to the common origin of Schwann cells and melanocytes in the neural crest. Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves. In the vertebrate embryo, multiple cell types originate from a common structure, the neural crest (NC), which forms at the dorsal tips of the neural epithelium.	['neural crest cells', 'NCC']

58a57f9460087bc10a00001f	Which mutated gene is associated with Waardenburg and Tietz syndromes?	Tietz/Waardenburg type 2A syndrome associated with posterior microphthalmos in two unrelated patients with novel MITF gene mutations. Tietz syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome type 2A are allelic conditions caused by MITF mutations.  For example, mutations of the MITF gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2A as well as Tietz syndrome. For example, mutations of MITF, SNAI2 and SOX10 genes are observed in Waardenburg syndrome type II and mutations of EDNRB, EDN3 and SOX10 genes are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type IV.  These disorders are represented by Waardenburg syndrome, piebaldism and Tietz syndrome, and are caused by different mutations of various or the same genes.  Mutations in the MITF have been found in patients with the dominantly inherited hypopigmentation and deafness syndromes Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome (TS).  All patients with PAX3 mutations had typical phenotype of WS with dystopia canthorum (WS1), whereas patients with MITF gene mutations presented without dystopia canthorum (WS2).  MITF 3-bp deletions at amino acid position 217 have previously been described in patients with Tietz syndrome (TS), a clinical entity with hearing loss and generalised hypopigmentation. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that sequencing and copy number analysis of both PAX3 and MITF have to be recommended in the routine molecular diagnostic setting for patients, WS1 and WS2. Furthermore, our genotype-phenotype analyses indicate that WS2 and TS correspond to a clinical spectrum that is influenced by MITF mutation type and position. Novel and recurrent non-truncating mutations of the MITF basic domain: genotypic and phenotypic variations in Waardenburg and Tietz syndromes. A notable relationship has been described between non-truncating mutations of its basic domain and Tietz syndrome, which is characterized by albinoid-like hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, rather than the patchy depigmentation seen in Waardenburg syndrome, and severe hearing loss.  Mutations in microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) lead to Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2), a dominantly inherited disorder involving hearing loss and pigment disturbances caused by a lack of melanocytes. On rare occasions, mutations in MITF lead to Tietz syndrome (TS), which is characterized by a severe WS2 phenotype.  In humans, haploinsufficiency of MITF causes Waardenburg syndrome type 2, while a dominant-negative mutation causes Tietz syndrome.  Tietz syndrome (hypopigmentation/deafness) caused by mutation of MITF. This family was reascertained and a missense mutation was found in the basic region of the MITF gene in family members with Tietz syndrome. Mutations in other regions of this gene have been found to produce Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2), which also includes pigmentary changes and hearing loss, but in contrast to Tietz syndrome, depigmentation is patchy and hearing loss is variable in WS2. In humans, MITF mutations cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome, autosomal dominant disorders resulting in deafness and hypopigmentation.  Mutation of the MITF gene in albinism-deafness syndrome (Tietz syndrome). MITF gene mutations account for 20% of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type II.  Mutations in the MITF have been found in patients with the dominantly inherited hypopigmentation and deafness syndromes Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome (TS). The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor, which regulates melanocyte development and the biosynthetic melanin pathway. A notable relationship has been described between non-truncating mutations of its basic domain and Tietz syndrome, which is characterized by albinoid-like hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, rather than the patchy depigmentation seen in Waardenburg syndrome, and severe hearing loss Mutations of the MITF gene may lead to hereditary diseases: Waardenburg type II and Tietz syndromes. The human deafness-pigmentation syndromes, Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type 2a, and Tietz syndrome are characterized by profound deafness but only partial cutaneous pigmentary abnormalities. Both syndromes are caused by mutations in MITF. On some occasions, mutations of a gene cause different syndromes that may have similar phenotypes. For example, mutations of the MITF gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (Tassabehji et al, 1994; Nobukuni et al, 1996) as well as Tietz syndrome (Smith et al, 1997) Mutations of the MITF gene may lead to hereditary diseases: Waardenburg type II and Tietz syndromes. Mutations in the MITF have been found in patients with the dominantly inherited hypopigmentation and deafness syndromes Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome (TS).

Hearing dysfunction in heterozygous Mitf(Mi-wh) /+ mice, a model for Waardenburg syndrome type 2 and Tietz syndrome. By analyzing the genes for Waardenburg syndrome, we showed that PAX3, the gene responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type 1, regulates MITF, the gene responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type 2. MITF gene mutations account for 20% of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type II. Mutations in the MITF have been found in patients with the dominantly inherited hypopigmentation and deafness syndromes Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome (TS) Novel and recurrent non-truncating mutations of the MITF basic domain: genotypic and phenotypic variations in Waardenburg and Tietz syndromes For example, mutations of the MITF gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2A as well as Tietz syndrome This family was reascertained and a missense mutation was found in the basic region of the MITF gene in family members with Tietz syndrome.  On rare occasions, mutations in MITF lead to Tietz syndrome (TS), which is characterized by a severe WS2 phenotype.  For example, mutations of the MITF gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (Tassabehji et al, 1994; Nobukuni et al, 1996) as well as Tietz syndrome (Smith et al, 1997).  For example, mutations of the MITF gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (Tassabehji et al, 1994; Nobukuni et al, 1996) as well as Tietz syndrome (Smith et al, 1997). In humans, MITF mutations cause Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (WS2A) and Tietz syndrome, autosomal dominant disorders resulting in deafness and hypopigmentation. In humans, haploinsufficiency of MITF causes Waardenburg syndrome type 2, while a dominant-negative mutation causes Tietz syndrome.

58bcabc702b8c6095300000e	What gene is mutated in Sickle Cell Anemia?	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder. SCA patients present clinical and hematologic variability that cannot be only explained by the single mutation in the beta-globin gene. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the HBB:c.20A>T mutation that leads to hemoglobin S synthesis. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single type of mutation, a homozygous A→T substitution in the ß globin gene. Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. The allele-specific PCR approach has been modified by introducing a second mismatch at the 3'-penultimate link of the primer and used to identify the sickle cell anemia mutation (A-->T transversion in the sixth codon of the human beta-globin gene causing Glu-->Val substitution in the protein), thus obviating the problem of an interpretationally ambiguous 3'-terminal mismatch including T residue. Sickle-cell anemia results from an A leads to T transversion in the second nucleotide of codon 6 of the beta-globin gene. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder arising from a point mutation in the beta-globin gene that leads to the replacement of glutamic acid residue by valine at the sixth position of the beta--chain of hemoglobin. Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disease resulting from production of mutant beta-globin (beta(S)) and has severe clinical consequences. 	['HBB']

58a2c77a60087bc10a000002	What is the role of gamma-secreatase complex in Alzheimer's Disease?	gamma-Secretase is critically involved in the Notch pathway and in Alzheimer's disease.  Presenilins are the catalytic subunit of the large gamma-secretase complex, that promotes intramembranous proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the production of beta-amyloid (A beta). Mutant presenilin causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), is related to abnormal Ca(2+) signaling, and render cells vulnerable to cell death.  Presenilins form the catalytic part of the gamma-secretases, protein complexes that are responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of transmembrane proteins. The presenilins are involved in several biological functions, but are best known for their role in the generation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and are therefore thought to be important drug targets for this disorder. Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) generated by proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, in that it cleaves a precursor to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients. Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer. The GxxxG motif in the transmembrane domain of AbetaPP plays an essential role in the interaction of CTF beta with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of amyloid-beta. Gamma-secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a crucial step in the formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), but little is known about how the substrate AbetaPP interacts with the gamma-secretase complex.  Thus, the present study revealed an essential role for the GxxxG motif in the interaction of AbetaPP with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of Abeta. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of hypoxia in modulating the APP processing by facilitating both beta- and gamma-cleavage which may result in a significant increase of Abeta generation. The gamma-secretase, composed of presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH-1), and PEN-2, is critical for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  APP is a ubiquitous membrane protein that is physiologically processed by site-specific proteolysis firstly by alpha- or beta-secretases, releasing a large fragment called APP(S) that contains most of the extracellular sequences of APP, a small extracellular stub, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail of APP (;AICD'-APP intracellular domain). These are subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase at multiple sites in the transmembrane region, releasing small peptides, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the major components of AD-associated amyloid fibrils.  As PS1 has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating gamma-secretase activity, and mutations in this protein are associated with familial AD (FAD), we have cloned it from SAMP8 mouse hippocampus and compared its sequence with those of other species. An increased amount or mutation(s) in PS1, which alters the stoichiometric balance of the gamma-secretase complex, may be the cause of aberrant or increased processing of APP, resulting in Abeta accumulation leading to loss of memory. The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression.  The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. Suppressor Mutations for Presenilin 1 Familial Alzheimer Disease Mutants Modulate γ-Secretase Activities Synthesis and SAR Studies of Fused Oxadiazines as γ-Secretase Modulators for Treatment of Alzheimers Disease Pathological activity of familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutant presenilin can be executed by six different gamma-secretase complexes. The reconstituted enzyme processes C99 and the Notch-like substrate N160 and displays the characteristic features of gamma-secretase in terms of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, upregulation of Abeta42 production by a familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation in the APP gene, and downregulation of Notch processing by PS1 FAD mutations.  The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Genetic analysis of familial Alzheimer's disease has revealed that mutations in the gamma-secretase enzyme presenilin promote toxic Abeta secretion; however, presenilin mutations might also influence tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration through gamma-secretase-independent mechanisms.  Here, we show that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations clustered near the sites of gamma-secretase cleavage actually decrease gamma-secretase-mediated release of the intracellular fragment of APP (CTFgamma).  Beside the well investigated role of presenilins as the catalytic unit in γ-secretase complex, their involvement in regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis has recently come into more focus of Alzheimer's disease research. The γ-secretase complex is a promising target in Alzheimer's disease because of its role in the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein. Genetic studies of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease cases revealed causative mutations in the genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein and the γ-secretase-complex components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, supporting an important role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Assembly, maturation, and trafficking of the gamma-secretase complex in Alzheimer's disease. Gamma-secretase was first recognized because of its role in the production of Abeta peptides that are pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of gamma-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease. Drugs that regulate the production of Abeta by inhibiting or modulating gamma-secretase activity could provide a disease-modifying effect on Alzheimer's disease, although recent studies suggest that gamma-secretase plays important roles in cellular signaling including Notch. The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease.. The gamma-secretase complex is therefore believed to be critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. gamma-Secretase heterogeneity in the Aph1 subunit: relevance for Alzheimer's disease.

Nerve growth factor inhibition with tanezumab influences weight-bearing and subsequent cartilage damage in the rat medial meniscal tear model. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibition with tanezumab on rats with medial meniscal tear (MMT) effectively model rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) observed in clinical trials.  Current research focuses on the development of new OA drugs (such as sprifermin/recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-18, tanezumab/monoclonal antibody against β-nerve growth factor), which aims for more effectiveness and less incidence of adverse effects than the traditional ones. Areas covered: This manuscript is a review that examines both the pharmacological properties and clinical studies of tanezumab, the most widely studied antibody to NGF, for management of osteoarthritis (OA) and low back pain.  OBJECTIVE: Evaluate efficacy and safety of tanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against nerve growth factor, in neuropathic pain. In preclinical studies, tanezumab, and its murine precursor muMab-911, effectively targeted the NGF pathway in various chronic and inflammatory pain models. Tanezumab (RN-624), a first-in-class recombinant humanized mAb targeting NGF, is being developed by Pfizer Inc for the potential treatment of pain associated with several conditions. Given that tanezumab is an antibody, the drug demonstrates the general advantages of this class of products (including good specificity and favorable pharmacokinetics), and also appears to be particularly well suited for targeting the chronic and inflammatory-mediating pain actions of NGF and its receptor system.

(MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) Community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a severe health concern because of its treatment difficulties. We investigated the distribution of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) on and around six patients with MRSA infection in our neurosurgical ward. The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at respiratory sites shed viable MRSA into the air of hospital rooms. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in prevalence among asymptomatic carriers and in cases of paediatric soft-tissue infections alike.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections pose a major challenge in health care, yet the limited heterogeneity within this group hinders molecular investigations of related outbreaks. In a previous study, we reported that two kaempferol glycosides isolated from Laurus nobilis L., kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2'',4''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C2) and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl-4''-Z-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C3), showed strong antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This article explains what methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is, how it is spread and what the real challenges are in healthcare settings in the UK. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging threat to public health, especially in correctional settings. There are few more compelling questions in clinical microbiology today than the issue of whether or not to screen for the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with the results being used to institute infection control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of MRSA in health care environments.

5880b812c872c95565000006	Which infection can be prevented with Dapivirine?	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to comprehensively assess mRNA expression of 84 drug transporters in human colorectal biopsies and six representative cell lines, and to investigate the alteration of drug transporter gene expression after exposure to three candidate microbicidal antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (tenofovir, darunavir and dapivirine) in the colorectal epithelium. The outcome of the objectives informs development of optimal ARV-based microbicidal formulations for prevention of HIV-1 infection. We evaluated the adherence and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine, maraviroc, or both drugs for 28 days during a Phase I placebo-controlled trial in 48 HIV-negative sexually abstinent U.S. women aged 18-40. Use of a Vaginal Ring Containing Dapivirine for HIV-1 Prevention in Women. Methods We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine, a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, involving women between the ages of 18 and 45 years in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Results Among the 2629 women who were enrolled, 168 HIV-1 infections occurred: 71 in the dapivirine group and 97 in the placebo group (incidence, 3.3 and 4.5 per 100 person-years, respectively). The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0.05) than that in the placebo group. In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0.007) than that in the placebo group. Conclusions A monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection among African women, with increased efficacy in subgroups with evidence of increased adherence.  BACKGROUND: This was the first microbicide trial conducted in Africa to evaluate an antiretroviral-containing vaginal ring as an HIV prevention technology for women.OBJECTIVES: The trial assessed and compared the safety, acceptability and adherence to product use of a 4-weekly administered vaginal ring containing the antiretroviral microbicide, dapivirine, with a matching placebo ring among women from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a favourable safety and acceptability profile. If proven safe and effective in large-scale trials, it will be an important component of combination HIV prevention approaches for women. PURPOSE: To develop polymeric films containing dual combinations of anti-HIV drug candidate tenofovir, maraviroc and dapivirine for vaginal application as topical microbicides. Efficacy trials with a dapivirine-containing vaginal ring for HIV prevention are ongoing and plans to develop multi-purpose vaginal rings for prevention of both HIV and pregnancy have been elaborated. Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection by the candidate microbicide dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0.046) than that in the placebo group. In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0.007) than that in the placebo group. Within this study the in vitro bioactivity of dapivirine as compared to the NNRTI UC781 was further established and a quick dissolve film was developed for vaginal application of dapivirine for prevention of HIV infection. Dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is in development as a microbicide for the protection of women against HIV infection. Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Dapivirine from both IVRs was successfully distributed throughout the lower genital tract at concentrations>1000x the EC(50) against wild-type HIV-1 (LAI) in MT4 cells suggesting that IVR delivery of microbicides is a viable option meriting further study. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission. To assess the potential of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) to affect the genital distribution and local and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of the anti-HIV microbicide drug candidate dapivirine after vaginal delivery.Dapivirine-loaded, poly(ethylene oxide)-coated poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) NPs were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection.  CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.  Antiretroviral-containing vaginal microbicide rings, which release medication over a month or longer, may reduce these adherence challenges.ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection. Dapivirine demonstrated potent dose-dependent inhibitory effects against a broad panel of HIV type 1 isolates from different clades. Two large efficacy trials of a vaginal ring containing the investigational drug dapivirine demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing HIV infections in women in Africa. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Plasma dapivirine concentrations were low (<1 ng/ml) and remained well below those observed at the maximum tolerated dose for oral treatment (mean Cmax of 2286  ng/ml).CONCLUSION: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile that supports its use as a sustained-release topical microbicide for HIV-1 prevention in women. ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection. Dual segment polyurethane intravaginal rings (IVRs) were fabricated to enable sustained release of antiretroviral agents dapivirine and tenofovir to prevent the male to female sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.	['HIV']
58917c88621ea6ff7e00000a	Where can you find the annulus of Zinn?	Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The annular tendon is commonly named 'annulus of Zinn', from the German anatomist and botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759) who described this structure in his Descriptio anatomica oculi humani (Anatomical Description of the Human Eye, 1755). It arose at the annulus of Zinn, passing forwards between the inferior rectus muscle and lateral rectus muscle, and insert directly on the sclera.  Drilling was continued toward the annulus of Zinn (AZ) and optic nerve superiorly and over the intracavernous ICA posteriorly. Measurements before and after resection of the ACP included the length of C6 segment of the ICA on its lateral aspect; C6 segment length on its medial aspect; and medial length of the optic nerve from the optic chiasm to falciform ligament (before ACP resection) then to the annulus of Zinn (after ACP resection). The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle.   In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1.5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles.  The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. PURPOSE: To describe a combined transcranial-orbital approach for en bloc resection of optic nerve gliomas with preservation of the annulus of Zinn that minimizes recurrence and prevents postoperative paralytic ptosis.DESIGN: A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.STUDY POPULATION: All patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resections using this technique with the authors between 1994 and 2010.PROCEDURE: A transcranial-orbital approach is used to resect the intracranial segment of the optic nerve glioma from 2 mm anterior to the chiasm to the posterior extent of annulus of Zinn. No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis.CONCLUSIONS: The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis. To describe a combined transcranial-orbital approach for en bloc resection of optic nerve gliomas with preservation of the annulus of Zinn that minimizes recurrence and prevents postoperative paralytic ptosis.A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.All patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resections using this technique with the authors between 1994 and 2010.A transcranial-orbital approach is used to resect the intracranial segment of the optic nerve glioma from 2 mm anterior to the chiasm to the posterior extent of annulus of Zinn Through a superior orbitotomy exposure, the entire retrobulbar segment of the tumor is transected from the globe to the annulus of Zinn A simulation of the procedure in a cadaver and en bloc resection of the orbital apex are performed to demonstrate the subdural plane of dissection within the annulus of Zinn.Postoperative outcome measures include: health of the ipsilateral globe, paralytic ptosis, postoperative complications, and tumor recurrence.Eleven patients underwent resection of optic nerve gliomas using this technique No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis.The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis The orbital surface of the medial rectus and inferior rectus are exposed from the annulus of Zinn to a position close to where the muscles penetrate Tenons capsule The orbital surface of the medial rectus and inferior rectus are exposed from the annulus of Zinn to a position close to where the muscles penetrate Tenon's capsule.  The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle. The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes.The findings for our patients, particularly in those who underwent additional high resolution MRI, did not provide evidence of a lack of CN IV as a cause of Brown syndrome. Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes. The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm.

5887fe7d3b87a8a738000008	What is the role of 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives in the immune system?	3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases with immune-regulating properties. Members of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases (ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP) play important roles in both the adaptive and innate human immune responses. Their enzymatic activity can contribute to the pathogenesis of several major human diseases ranging from viral and parasitic infections to autoimmunity and cancer. We have previously demonstrated that diaminobenzoic acid derivatives show promise as selective inhibitors for this group of aminopeptidases. In this study, we have thoroughly explored a series of 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of this class of enzymes, achieving submicromolar inhibitors for ERAP2 (IC50 = 237 nM) and IRAP (IC50 = 105 nM). Cell-based analysis indicated that the lead compounds can be effective in downregulating macrophage activation induced by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ as well as cross-presentation by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Our results indicate that this class of inhibitors may be useful for the targeted downregulation of immune responses. 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases with immune-regulating properties Members of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases (ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP) play important roles in both the adaptive and innate human immune responses. 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases with immune-regulating properties.

BACKGROUND: Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is an endemic neurological disease in Northeast Siberia and generally considered to be a chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown origin actually spreading in the Sakha (Yakutian) Republic. Communicating hydrocephalus following eosinophilic meningitis is pathogenic for chronic Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in Northeastern Siberia. Epidemiology of Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in Eastern Siberia. . An epidemic of this disease has been spreading throughout the Yakut Republic of the Russian Federation. METHODS: Detailed clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and epidemiologic studies have identified 414 patients with definite Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in 15 of 33 administrative regions of the Yakut Republic between 1940 and 1999. Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in Eastern Siberia - analysis of 390 cases. Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is a unique disease occurring in the Yakut (Sakha) population of Eastern Siberia.

58c99fcc02b8c60953000029	What does the human ABCC gene  product do?	structure, function, and expression of the important drug resistance-conferring members belonging to three subfamilies of the human ABC family; these are ABCB1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein of subfamily ABCB), subfamily ABCC (MRPs), and ABCG2 (BCRP of subfamily ABCG), which are expressed in various organs.  Transport proteins, including members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP)/ABCC subfamily, have been recognized to contribute to the latter function. MRP5 (ABCC5) was identified as transmembrane transport protein for cyclic nucleotides, especially 3',5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP), indicating an additional role in signal transduction and a potential role in placenta development. According to the new nomenclature of human ABC transporter genes, the 'ABCC' gene sub-family comprises three classes involving multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), sulfonylurea receptors (SURs), and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). With the addition of these two genes, the complete human ABCC subfamily has 12 identified members (ABCC1-12), nine from the multidrug resistance-like subgroup, two from the sulfonylurea receptor subgroup, and the CFTR gene. Identification and bioinformatic characterization of a multidrug resistance associated protein (ABCC) gene in Plasmodium berghei. One major group of transporters is known as multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP; ABCC gene family). On the other hand, several human multidrug resistance proteins [human ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily C (ABCC)] cause resistance against nucleoside analogs and mediate transport of phosphorylated nucleoside derivatives out of the cells in an ATP-dependent manner. According to the new nomenclature of human ABC transporter genes, the 'ABCC' gene sub-family comprises three classes involving multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), sulfonylurea receptors (SURs), and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several MRP/ABCC members (MRPs 1-3) are associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. In vitro, the MRP/ABCC transporters can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, arsenical and antimonial oxyanions, peptide-based agents, and in concert with alterations in phase II conjugating or biosynthetic enzymes, classical alkylating agents, alkylating agents. The human MRP/ABCC transporters except MRP9/ABCC12 are all able to transport organic anions, such as drugs conjugated to glutathione, sulphate or glucuronate. The ABCC multidrug resistance associated proteins (ABCC-MRP), a subclass of ABC transporters are involved in multiple physiological processes that include cellular homeostasis, metal detoxification, and transport of glutathione-conjugates. he ABCC subfamily of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which were formerly known as multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRPs), consists of closely related members found in all eukaryotic organisms. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a superfamily of membrane proteins that are best known for their ability to transport a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous substances across membranes against a concentration gradient via ATP hydrolysis. There are seven subfamilies of human ABC transporters, one of the largest being the 'C' subfamily (gene symbol ABCC). Nine ABCC subfamily members, the so-called multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) 1-9, have been implicated in mediating multidrug resistance in tumor cells to varying degrees as the efflux extrude chemotherapeutic compounds (or their metabolites) from malignant cells	['ATP dependent small molecule transporter']

58b6cd3222d300530900000d	Which ApoE isoform is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease?	Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective. Importantly, lipoproteins containing the apoE3 isoform had higher TGF-beta levels and bioactivity than those containing apoE4, a major genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.  ApoE4 is positively associated with atherosclerosis and late-onset and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist.  Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The apolipoprotein E (apoE) type epsilon 4 isoform specifies increased cerebral and cerebrovascular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (A beta) and contributes to the genetic susceptibility underlying a large proportion (approximately 60%) of typical, sporadic Alzheimer disease. The structural preference of apoE4 to remain functional in solution may explain the enhanced opportunity of apoE4 isoform to display its pathophysiologic functions in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele is associated with Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and decreased longevity. The apolipoprotein E type 4 allele is a susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele is the strongest risk factor of sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD), however, the fluid concentrations of ApoE and its different isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4) in AD patients and among APOE genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4) remain controversial Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease (AD) Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective.  Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease.  The apoE4 allele is a major risk factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with a poor outcome after brain injury.  Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective. Importantly, lipoproteins containing the apoE3 isoform had higher TGF-beta levels and bioactivity than those containing apoE4, a major genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

The decreased antioxidant activity of E4 could contribute to its association with Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease and decreased longevity. The isoform apoE4 is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and it has been postulated that high intracellular cholesterol levels promote the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. Among three ɛ2, ɛ3, ɛ4 alleles, ɛ4 allele is associated with the increase in cholesterol level, risk of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease, while ɛ2 allele is associated with the decrease in cholesterol level and risk of atherosclerosis. Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The structural preference of apoE4 to remain functional in solution may explain the enhanced opportunity of apoE4 isoform to display its pathophysiologic functions in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease..

58bca2f302b8c6095300000c	What chromosome is affected in Turner's syndrome?	Turner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal defect with partial or total absence of the X chromosome.  Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the complete or partial absence of an X chromosome in affected women Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder caused by complete or partial X chromosome monosomy that manifests various clinical features depending on the karyotype and on the genetic background of affected girls CONTEXT: Turner syndrome (TS) is the most common genetic problem affecting women and occurs when an X chromosome is completely deleted, portions of an X chromosome are deleted, or chromosomal mosaicism occurs.  Turner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder that results from the loss of the entire or a part of the X-chromosome and occurs in 1/2,500 female births. Women with Turner's syndrome (TS), who lack a complete X-chromosome, show an impairment in remembering faces and in classifying "fear" in face images. The proposition that finger print variability between individuals might be reduced by the absence of an X-chromosome in Turner's syndrome was rejected. While the classic karyotype related to Turner's syndrome is 45,X, the majority of those affected actually have a mosaic chromosomal complement, most often with a second normal cell line (46,XX). 45,X Turner's syndrome in monozygotic twin sisters. Monosomy for the X chromosome is the most frequent cause of Turner's syndrome, a common clinical syndrome associated with particular physical and neurobehavioral features. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality in which there is complete or partial absence of the X chromosome.

58cd7af402b8c6095300003e	What is the aim of the TRAP assay?	Positive activity by the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) was identified in cell extracts of Escherichia coli expressing a sequence-optimized hTERT gene The regulatory role of PCDH10 in telomerase activity was confirmed by a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, and the biological functions of it were characterized by in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. TRAP assay is a standard method for detecting telomerase activity in various tissues or cell lines.  Telomerase activity was determined by TRAP assay. The telomerase activity was evaluated by TRAP assay.  The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) represents an easy and rapid method for detection of telomerase activity in cells. A non-telomeric TS primer is extended by telomerase in the first step followed by the PCR amplification of the products. The PCR step renders this protocol very sensitive to detect telomerase activity at the single cell level making it compatible with the analysis of tumor samples. When run on a polyacrylamide gel, the PCR product is a characteristic ladder of bands due to the repetitive nature of telomeric DNA sequence. The densitometric analysis of the ladder allows the TRAP assay to be used for comparative quantification of telomerase activity in different samples. Telomerase enzyme activity can be detected in whole cell lysates by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method referred to as the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP).

We present and make available libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching under both the edit and the Hamming distance models. Moreover we describe how fixed-length approximate string matching is applied to solve real problems by incorporating libFLASM into established applications for multiple circular sequence alignment as well as single and structured motif extraction.

589d965a78275d0c4a000049	Which polymerase transcribes pri-miRNAs?	Previous studies in vivo reported that processing of primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) is coupled to transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and can occur co-transcriptionally.  we have established a robust in vivo system in which pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNAP II and processed to pre-miRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. In addition, obvious enrichments of three histone modifications (H2BK5me1, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1) as well as RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) were observed on pre-miRNA genomic sequences corresponding to the active-promoter miRNAs and expressed miRNAs Because the transcripts of most miRNA genes are the products of type-II RNA polymerase, pri-miRNA has a poly(A) tail and appears in expressed sequence tags (EST) Recent evidence indicates that miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) Since Pol II transcripts are capped, we hypothesized that CBP (cap-binding protein) 20 and 80 may bind to capped primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts and play a role in their processing. Here, we show that cbp20 and cbp80 mutants have reduced miRNA levels and increased pri-miRNA levels.  Analogously to mRNAs, the non-protein-encoding pri-miRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and post-transcriptionally modified by addition of a 5'-cap and a 3'-poly (A) tail. Plant miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II,then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). miRNAs are excised in a stepwise process from double-stranded RNA precursors that are embedded in long RNA polymerase II primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). Plant pri-miRNAs are transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and their levels are determined through transcription and degradation, whereas pri-miRNA processing is affected by its structure, splicing, alternative splicing, loading to the processor and the processor activity, which involve in many accessory proteins. Specifically, MHV68 miRNAs are transcribed from RNA polymerase III promoters located within adjacent viral tRNA-like sequences. Mammalian miRNA biogenesis begins with cotranscriptional cleavage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts by the Microprocessor complex. miRNAs are excised in a stepwise process from double-stranded RNA precursors that are embedded in long RNA polymerase II primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). Canonical primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) precursors are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and then processed by the Drosha endonuclease to generate approximately 60 nt pre-miRNA hairpins. Treatment of cells overexpressing NF90 and NF45 with an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, alpha-amanitin, did not reduce the amounts of pri-miRNAs, suggesting that the accumulation of pri-miRNAs is not due to transcriptional activation. Plant miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II,then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) Plant pri-miRNAs are transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and their levels are determined through transcription and degradation, whereas pri-miRNA processing is affected by its structure, splicing, alternative splicing, loading to the processor and the processor activity, which involve in many accessory proteins The majority of human miRNA genes is transcribed by polymerase II and can be classified as class II genes similar to protein-coding genes. Plant pri-miRNAs are transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and their levels are determined through transcription and degradation, whereas pri-miRNA processing is affected by its structure, splicing, alternative splicing, loading to the processor and the processor activity, which involve in many accessory proteins. In plant, primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) transcribed from miRNA genes by RNA polymerase II are first processed into stem-loop pre-miRNAs and further chopped into ∼21 nt long miRNAs by RNase III-like enzyme DCL1. These small RNAs are first transcribed by RNA polymerase II as a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript, which is then cleaved into the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Here we present the first direct evidence that miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Plant miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II,then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Here we have established a robust in vivo system in which pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNAP II and processed to pre-miRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Although it is assumed that miRNA promoters are similar in structure to gene promoters, since both are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), computational validations exhibit poor performance of gene promoter prediction methods on miRNAs.

58cbb98c02b8c60953000034	Which mutated enzyme is responsible for oculocutaneous 1 (OCA1)-type albinism?	An overview of oculocutaneous albinism: TYR gene mutations in five Colombian individuals To date, 230 mutations in the TYR gene have been reported as responsible for oculocutaneus albinism type 1 worldwide. TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase involved in the metabolic pathway of melanin synthesis. Mutations were identified in the TYR gene as responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in five Colombian individuals, and a new ophthalmic system was tested that corrected visual defects and symptoms in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism. Mutations in the gene for tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1, and more than 100 mutations of this gene have been identified. The Q402 allele has been associated with autosomal recessive ocular albinism when it is in trans with a tyrosinase gene mutation associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1. The disruption of tyrosinase trafficking occurs at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in OCA1 and OCA3, but at the post-Golgi level in OCA2.  Mutations at a single N-glycosylation sequon of tyrosinase have been reported to be responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type IA in humans, characterized by inactive tyrosinase and the total absence of pigmentation.  Mutations of the human tyrosinase gene associated with tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1).  Mutations in the human tyrosinase gene produce tyrosinase-related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1, MIM #203100). Tyrosinase is a copper containing enzyme and is responsible for catalyzing the rate limiting step in melanin biosynthesis, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopaquinone. We report 13 new mutations in the tyrosinase gene associated with OCA1A (without pigment) and OCA1B (with pigment) including 9 missense mutations (H19Q, R521, R77C, G97R, C289R, L312V, P313R, F340L and H404P), two nonsense mutations (W80X and R116X) and two frameshift mutations (53delG and 223 delG).  Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100). Mutations of the tyrosinase gene associated with a partial or complete loss of enzymatic activity are responsible for tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase gene, is genetically and biochemically the best understood type of albinism. Mutations in six genes have been reported to be responsible for different types of oculocutaneous and ocular albinism, including the tyrosinase gene (TYR) and OCA1 (MIM# 203100), the OCA2 gene and OCA2 (MIM# 203200), the tyrosinase-related protein-1 gene (TYRP1) and OCA3 (MIM# 203290), the HPS gene and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (MIM# 203300), the CHS gene (CHS1), and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (MIM# 214500), and the X-linked ocular albinism gene and OA1 (MIM#300500). Defects in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) cause a common type of OCA, known as oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in man may be caused by mutations within the tyrosinase gene (TYR) resulting in OCA1. Two novel tyrosinase (TYR) gene mutations with pathogenic impact on oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). BACKGROUND: Tyrosinase (TYR) catalyzes the rate-limiting, first step in melanin production and its gene (TYR) is mutated in many cases of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1), an autosomal recessive cause of childhood blindness. Mutation analysis and prenatal gene diagnosis for the mutated tyrosinase (TYR) gene in two families with oculocutaneous albinism type I (OCA1).To define the fetus genotypes and gene mutation sites, the PCR and sequencing techniques were applied to amplify and analyze the regions of exon, exon-intron and promoter of TYR gene in probands and their parents of 2 families.The patient or proband of family 1 showed as a compound heterozygote with mutants R278X and 929insC Mutations in the gene for tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1, and more than 100 mutations of this gene have been identified TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase involved in the metabolic pathway of melanin synthesis.Mutations were identified in the TYR gene as responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in five Colombian individuals, and a new ophthalmic system was tested that corrected visual defects and symptoms in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism.Samples were taken from 5 individuals, four of whom belong to a single family, along with a fifth individual not related to the family Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme Disrupting mutations in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene are known to cause recessive albinisms in humans (oculocutaneous albinism Type 1; OCA1) and other species To explore the patients genotypes and the mutation spectrum of Tyrosinase (TYR) gene and the effects on protein structure and function in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1).The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques were applied to amplify and analyze the regions of exon, exonintron and promoter of TYR gene of 15 OCA1 probands and some of their parents Genetic analysis of oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) in Indian families: two novel frameshift mutations in the TYR Gene Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100).  Mutations of the tyrosinase gene associated with a partial or complete loss of enzymatic activity are responsible for tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1).  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene and presents with either complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes due to a defect in an enzyme involved in the production of melanin.  Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme.  OCA1 (MIM 203100) is associated with mutations of the TYR gene encoding tyrosinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin pigment) and accounts for approximately 40% of OCA worldwide.  Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes several reactions in the biosynthesis of melanin pigments and is deficient in patients with type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme. Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100). In humans mutations in the TYR gene are associated with type 1 oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1) that leads to reduced or absent pigmentation of skin, hair and eye. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase gene (TYR). Tyrosinase (TYR) catalyzes the rate-limiting, first step in melanin production and its gene (TYR) is mutated in many cases of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1), an autosomal recessive cause of childhood blindness.

Therapeutic research for OCA1 has been hampered, in part, by the absence of purified, active, recombinant wild-type and mutant human enzymes.The intra-melanosomal domain of human tyrosinase (residues 19-469) and two OCA1B related temperature-sensitive mutants, R422Q and R422W were expressed in insect cells and produced in T. ni larvae. The tyrosinase gene family of proteins (tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2) regulate the type of eumelanin synthesized and mutations affecting them result in OCA1, OCA3, and slaty (in the murine system), respectively.

58a6db8660087bc10a00002c	Which protein mediates the replacement of H2A by H2A.Z in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae?	The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer he multisubunit nucleosome-remodeling enzyme complex SWR1, conserved from yeast to mammals, catalyzes the ATP-dependent replacement of histone H2A in canonical nucleosomes with H2A.Z. Our results show that the Swr1-Z domain can deliver the H2A.Z-H2B dimer to the DNA-(H3-H4)2 tetrasome to form the nucleosome by a histone chaperone mechanism. H2A.Z is deposited into chromatin by the SWR1 complex and is subject to acetylation of its four N-terminal tail lysine residues by the NuA4 and SAGA histone acetyltransferase complexes. H2A.Z deposition is controlled by SWR-C chromatin remodeling enzymes that catalyze the nucleosomal exchange of canonical H2A with H2A.Z.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase, is the catalytic core of a multisubunit chromatin remodeling enzyme, called the SWR1 complex, that efficiently replaces conventional histone H2A in nucleosomes with histone H2A.Z. The system demonstrates ATP- and SWR1-complex-dependent replacement of histone H2A for histone H2A.Z on a preassembled nucleosome array.  We identified a complex containing 13 different polypeptides associated with a soluble pool of H2A.Z in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This complex was designated SWR1-Com in reference to the Swr1p subunit, a Swi2/Snf2-paralog. The SWR1 complex replaces the canonical histone H2A with the variant H2A.Z (Htz1 in yeast) at specific chromatin regions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deposition of histone H2AZ is mediated by the multiprotein SWR1 complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin deposition of histone H2AZ is mediated by the fourteen-subunit SWR1 complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ. This incorporation is mediated by the conserved SWR1 complex, which replaces histone H2A in canonical nucleosomes with H2A.Z in an ATP-dependent manner.  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase, is the catalytic core of a multisubunit chromatin remodeling enzyme, called the SWR1 complex, that efficiently replaces conventional histone H2A in nucleosomes with histone H2A.Z.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin deposition of histone H2AZ is mediated by the fourteen-subunit SWR1 complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deposition of histone H2AZ is mediated by the multiprotein SWR1 complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ.  The Swc4p protein, encoded by an essential gene, is shared by two chromatin-remodeling complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells: NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) and SWR1.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Yaf9 is a subunit of both the essential histone acetyltransferase complex NuA4 and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWR1-C, which deposits histone variant H2A.Z into euchromatin. Here, we identify and characterize SERRATED LEAVES AND EARLY FLOWERING (SEF), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of the yeast SWC6 protein, a conserved subunit of the SWR1/SRCAP complex. The SWR1/SRCAP complex is a chromatin-remodeling complex that has been shown to be involved in substitution of histone H2A by the histone variant H2A.Z in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animals. The Swc4p protein, encoded by an essential gene, is shared by two chromatin-remodeling complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells: NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) and SWR1. The SWR1 complex (SWR1C) in yeast catalyzes the replacement of nucleosomal H2A with the H2AZ variant, which ensures full activation of underlying genes. In addition, H2AZ, a substrate of SWR1C, interacts with both PIE1 and AtSWC2. The incorporation of H2AZ into chromatin is dependent on the SWR1 complex, which catalyses the replacement of conventional histone H2A with H2AZ. H2A histone-fold and DNA elements in nucleosome activate SWR1-mediated H2A.Z replacement in budding yeast. They report that reversal of H2A.Z replacement is mediated by SWR1 and related INO80 on an H2A.Z nucleosome carrying H3K56Q. The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. This incorporation is mediated by the conserved SWR1 complex, which replaces histone H2A in canonical nucleosomes with H2A.Z in an ATP-dependent manner. Here, we show that the JmjC domain protein Msc1 is a novel component of the fission yeast Swr1 complex and is required for Swr1-mediated incorporation of H2A.Z into nucleosomes at gene promoters.

58cd7fed02b8c6095300003f	What is the function of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)?	The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis.  The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) plays a pivotal role in systemic calcium metabolism by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion and urinary calcium excretion. The CaSR is ubiquitously expressed, implying a wide range of functions regulated by this receptor. The CaSR is a key regulator for such diverse processes as hormone secretion, gene expression, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Due to this pleiotropy, the CaSR is able to regulate cell fate and is implicated in the development of many types of benign or malignant tumours of the breast, prostate, parathyroid, and colon. Extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and ovarian cancer gene receptor 1 (OGR1) are two GPCRs that sense extracellular Ca(2+) and H(+), respectively.   The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) plays a key role in maintaining calcium homeostasis	['The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis.']
58cd90c202b8c60953000040	What is the role of IL-18BP?	Interleukin 18--binding protein ameliorates liver ischemia--reperfusion injury.  IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective effects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme activities and cytokine levels.  Because of IL-18's potential pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive effects, its biological activities are tightly controlled in the body by its naturally occurring antagonist called IL-18BP. The antagonist is produced in the body both constitutively and in response to an increased production of IL-18 as a negative feedback mechanism. Under physiological conditions, most of IL-18 in the circulation is bound with IL-18BP and is inactive. However, an imbalance in the production of IL-18 and its antagonist (an increase in the production of IL-18 with a decrease, no increase or an insufficient increase in the production of IL-18BP) has been described in many chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. L-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.  Platelets also contain the IL-18 antagonist, the IL-18-Binding Protein (IL-18BP) The natural inhibitor IL-18BP , whose production is enhanced by IFN-γ and IL-27, further regulates IL-18 activity in the extracellular environment.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-18.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. The balance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important role in the inflammatory setting.	['IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.

58adc1ff9ef3c34033000006	Which protein mediates gene loop formation in the yeast S. cerevisiae?	A transcription-independent role for TFIIB in gene looping. Moreover, looping is dependent upon the general transcription factor TFIIB: the E62K (glutamic acid 62 -->lysine) form of TFIIB adversely affects looping at every gene tested, including BLM10, SAC3, GAL10, SEN1, and HEM3 TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP We present a high-resolution genome-wide map of TFIIB locations that implicates 3' NFRs in gene looping. Instead, activators physically interacted with the general transcription factor TFIIB when the genes were activated and in a looped configuration. TFIIB cross-linked to both the promoter and the terminator regions during the transcriptionally activated state of a gene.   We propose that the activators facilitate gene looping through their interaction with TFIIB during transcriptional activation of genes. Gene looping, defined as the interaction of the promoter and the terminator regions of a gene during transcription, requires transcription factor IIB (TFIIB). We have earlier demonstrated association of TFIIB with the distal ends of a gene in an activator-dependent manner Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation. TFIIB also cross-links to terminator regions and is required for gene loops that juxtapose promoter-terminator elements in a transcription-dependent manner. These results define a novel, functional interaction between TFIIB and Ssl2 that affects start site selection and gene looping. Gene-loop formation is dependent on regulatory proteins localized at the 5' and 3' ends of genes, such as TFIIB.

58bfd0db02b8c60953000017	Which virus type causes Molluscum contagiosum?	Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a poxvirus pathogenic for humans, replicates well in human skin in vivo, but not in vitro in standard monolayer cell cultures. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that causes tumor-like skin lesions.  Molluscum contagiosum poxvirus (MCV) type 1 and type 2 encode two chemokine-like proteins MC148R1 and MC148R2. I Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a common, human poxvirus that causes small papular skin lesions that persist for long periods without signs of inflammation.  All poxviruses studied encode a type 1B topoisomerase that introduces transient nicks into DNA and thereby relaxes DNA supercoils. Here we present a study of the protein domains of the topoisomerase of the poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (MCV), which allows us to specify DNA contacts made by different domains.  Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) causes molluscum contagiosum (MC) in both children and adults. MC54L, the IL-18 binding protein of the human poxvirus that causes molluscum contagiosum, is unique in having a C-terminal tail of nearly 100 amino acids that is dispensable for IL-18 binding. Molluscum contagiosum is a common superficial skin infection caused by the poxvirus, Molluscum Contagiosum virus. Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin and mucosal disease of viral origin, caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) virus of poxvirus family.

58bde18b02b8c60953000014	What is the function of BAX	pro-apoptotic protein Bax Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells Thus, PP2A may function as a physiological Bax regulatory phosphatase that not only dephosphorylates Bax but also activates its proapoptotic function. The ability of the mutants to protect against Bax-mediated cell death is divided into three groups: (1) group I, retention of anti-Bax function in both the Val129 and Met129 mutants; (2) group II, retention of anti-Bax function only in Val129 mutants; and (3) group III, reduction or no anti-Bax function in Val129 and Met129 mutants. A popular model of BCL-2 and BAX involvement in apoptosis suggests that upon apoptosis induction cytosolic BAX translocates to the mitochondria, where it displays the pro-apoptotic function, which involves its homodimerization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of the gene coding for the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, the proapoptotic molecule Bax, and the apoptosis executor enzyme caspase-3 in preimplantation renal biopsies (PIB) as markers for delayed graft function.In this prospective single-center study, gene expression levels were evaluated using real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction in PIB of kidneys from 72 deceased donors (DDs) and 18 living donors (LDs).CASP3 and BAX expression levels were higher, whereas those of BCL2 were lower, in DD than in LD PIB The function Bax and/or Bak in constituting a gateway for mitochondrial apoptosis in response to apoptotic stimuli has been unequivocally demonstrated Bax is a major proapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family that is required for apoptotic cell death. Bax is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins which localizes to and uses mitochondria as its major site of action. death-promoting Bax protein The suppressors function through heterodimerization with the death promoters, Bax Bax- and Bak-mediated apoptosis severely limits adenoviral replication, Bax a pro-apoptotic member localizes as monomers in the cytosol of healthy cells and accumulates as oligomers in mitochondria of apoptotic cell Bax and Bak (Bax/Bak) are essential pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family that trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) in a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable manner. BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The multi-BCL-2 homology domain pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members BAK and BAX have critical roles in apoptosis. They are essential for mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabili Members of the Bcl-2 family play key roles as proapoptotic (e.g., Bax) and antiapoptotic (e.g., Bcl-x(L)) regulators of programmed cell death The Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), belonging to the Bcl-2 family, plays a pivotal role in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.

58e75d483e8b6dc87c000005	Which gene controls the expression of GATA-1 isoforms?	Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.  This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation. Novel combinatorial interactions of GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms regulate transcription of the gene encoding eosinophil granule major basic protein. Furthermore, we observe that in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver cells, low levels of the IE GATA-1 isoform is expressed, but the variant IB isoform is absent. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27)..

5880e417713cbdfd3d000001	Which disease is treated with ZMapp?	Gene Transfer of ZMapp Antibodies Mediated by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Protects Against Ebola Infections. Vectored delivery of the ZMapp antibody cocktail (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) by using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) could be useful for preventive immunization against Ebola virus infections because rAAVs can generate long-term antibody expression. ZMapp Reinforces the Airway Mucosal Barrier Against Ebola Virus. Addition of ZMapp, a cocktail of Ebola-binding immunoglobulin G antibodies, effectively reduced mobility of Ebola pseudovirus in the same mucus secretions. Topical delivery of ZMapp to the mouse airways also facilitated rapid elimination of Ebola pseudovirus.  Several strategies have been developed in the past to treat EBOV infection, including the antibody cocktail ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in nonhuman primate models of infection 1 and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans 2  Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.  Only recently have vaccine or drug regimens for the Ebola virus been developed, including Zmapp and peptides.  Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir, favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp).  The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. However, during the recent outbreak, monoclonal antibody cocktails such as ZMapp, ZMAb and MB-003 were either tested in a human clinical safety and efficacy trial or provided to some based on compassionate grounds. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. BACKGROUND  Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). For example, several patients of the present Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa were treated with ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies which are expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . Several patients with Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies , TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA , brincidofovir , and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics . BACKGROUND Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of care alone in patients with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an experimental drug named ZMapp was administered on an emergency basis to seven patients of which five were recovered. BACKGROUND: Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. This includes agents belonging to various therapeutic classes, namely direct antiviral agents (favipiravir and BCX4430), a combination of antibodies (ZMapp), type I interferons, RNA interference-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and anticoagulant drugs (rNAPc2).  During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients.  Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics.  The human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail ZMapp, previously shown to be efficacious in EBOV (variant Kikwit) lethally infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administration was initiated up to 5 days, was used in some patients during the outbreak. We show that a two-antibody cocktail, MIL77E, is fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV variant Makona, the virus responsible for the ongoing 2014-2015 outbreak, whereas a similar formulation of ZMapp protected two of three NHPs.  The growing promise of plant-made biologics is highlighted by the success story of ZMapp™ as a potentially life-saving drug during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.  Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp. Background Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Several patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA, brincidofovir, and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics. Also there is no specific vaccine and treatment for Ebola virus; however, many candidate vaccines and antiviral-drugs such as ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are being developed for Ebola virus disease. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus Infection. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola.  Going forward, this work now provides a basis for strategic selection of next-generation antibody cocktails against Ebola and related viruses and a model for predicting the impact of ZMapp on potential escape mutations in ongoing or future Ebola outbreaks. Some potential therapeutic materials including ZMapp were supplied and the treated people got over the EVD. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. This review explores some of the more prominent recent advances in the biofarming of viral vaccines and therapies, including the recent use of ZMapp for Ebolavirus infection, and explores some possible future applications of the technology.

58853667e56acf5176000015	What is the effect of the direct interaction of Ikaros and Foxp1 in B-lymphocytes?	Direct interaction of Ikaros and Foxp1 modulates expression of the G protein-coupled receptor G2A in B-lymphocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We describe a novel physical and functional interaction between the proteins, which requires the central zinc finger domain of Ikaros. The Ikaros-Foxp1 interaction is abolished by deletion of this region, which corresponds to the IK6 isoform that is commonly associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also identify the Gpr132 gene, which encodes the orphan G protein-coupled receptor G2A, as a novel target for Foxp1.  Our results reveal a novel effect of Ikaros haploinsufficiency on Foxp1 functioning, and identify G2A as a potential modulator of the cell cycle in Ikaros-deleted B-ALL.

58d900428acda3452900000c	What is the inheritance of Barth syndrome?	Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked recessive disease primarily affecting males. The results of our study should not only be applicable to BTHS families, but also to families with other X-linked diseases. Barth syndrome, an X-linked disorder that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and growth delay, is caused by mutations in the taffazin gene at Xq28 that result in cardiolipin deficiency and abnormal mitochondria.  Barth syndrome should be considered when boys present with cardiomyopathy, especially when associated with increased left ventricular trabeculations, neutropenia, skeletal muscle weakness, or family history indicating an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the G4.5 gene result in a wide spectrum of severe infantile X-linked cardiomyopathic phenotypes including Barth syndrome with dilated cardiomyopathy and INVM. X-linked mode of inheritance is seen in Menkes disease, Barth syndrome, and in deficiencies of the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.  X-linked mode of inheritance is seen in Menkes disease, Barth syndrome, and in deficiencies of the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. OBJECTIVE: Barth syndrome is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder that affects only boys.

58de18e48acda3452900002a	Which miRNA is targeted by SRY/Sox9?	Does the linear Sry transcript function as a ceRNA for miR-138? Recently, the sex determining region Y ( Sry) and the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 ( CDR1as) RNA transcripts have been described to function as a new class of post-transcriptional regulatory RNAs that behave as circular endogenous RNA sponges for the micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-138 and miR-7, respectively.   it is reasonable to think that the linear Sry sense transcript could additionally act as a miRNA sponge, or as an endogenous competing RNA for miR-138. Results indicated that miR-138 directly targeted SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and overexpression of SOX4 and HIF-1α effectively reversed the miR-138-mediated suppression of cell invasion. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.

58d8e6818acda3452900000a	Which gene mutations cause the Marfan syndrome?	The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome (MFS) highlight the importance of a FBN1 mutation test in diagnosing MFS.  A marked decrease in heart rate variability in Marfan syndrome patients with confirmed FBN1 mutations. The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation.  Heart rates in MS patients with the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test (p<0.001). A marked decrease in HRV, documented in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed FBN1 gene mutations. Evaluating the quality of Marfan genotype-phenotype correlations in existing FBN1 databases. Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Novel FBN1 gene mutation and maternal germinal mosaicism as the cause of neonatal form of Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1).  While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. [Screening of FBN1 gene mutations in a family with Marfan syndrome]. To identify FBN1 gene mutations in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome. Identification of fibrillin-1 gene mutations in Marfan syndrome by high-resolution melting analysis. Three diagnostic classifications comprising first, Marfan genotype with a causative FBN1 gene mutation; second, Marfan phenotype with clinical criteria of the original Ghent nosology (Ghent-1); and third, phenotype with clinical criteria of its current revision (Ghent-2) in 300 consecutive persons referred for confirmation or exclusion of Marfan syndrome (150 men, 150 women aged 35 ± 13 years) were used. Prevalence of dural ectasia in 63 gene-mutation-positive patients with features of Marfan syndrome type 1 and Loeys-Dietz syndrome and report of 22 novel FBN1 mutations. Marfan syndrome type 1 (MFS1) is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. Fibrillin gene (FBN1) mutations in Japanese patients with Marfan syndrome. Mutations in FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2 are known to cause Marfan syndrome (MIM 154700), a pleiotropic disorder. Classic, atypically severe and neonatal Marfan syndrome: twelve mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in FBN1 exons 24-40. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype. Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) are known to cause classical Marfan's syndrome, ectopia lentis and neonatal Marfan's syndrome. Severe Marfan syndrome due to FBN1 exon deletions. BACKGROUND: Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications. It is still difficult to use modern genetic testing for diagnosis because Marfan syndrome can be caused by many different mutations in FBN1, a large gene with 65 coding segments, while mutations in other genes can cause overlapping phenotypes The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations.Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), and related connective tissue disorders Acute mitral regurgitation due to chordal rupture in a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by a deletion in exon 29 of the FBN1 gene. Neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by an exon 25 mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. Functional pulmonary atresia in a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by a c.3602G>A mutation in exon 29 of the FBN1 gene. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system.  It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome. Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes. Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome. By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of Marfan syndrome by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the renal malformation in the patient. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD. Marfan syndrome is a multisystem disorder of connective tissue that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and results from mutation of the FBN1 gene on human chromosome 15. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system. We here report 22 novel and 9 recurrent mutations in the FBN1 gene in 36 patients with clinical features of Marfan syndrome. The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission. FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause Marfan syndrome in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the Marfan syndrome type II gene. Fifteen novel FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome detected by heteroduplex analysis of genomic amplicons. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. Mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin-1, FBN1, are known to cause Marfan syndrome, and have been identified in almost all exons of FBN1. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population. While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, on chromosome 15q21.1, have been found to cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by clinically variable skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterised by pleiotropic manifestations involving primarily the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene causing the Marfan syndrome.

5880c42fc872c95565000008	Which disease is treated with semaglutide?	INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are increasingly being used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but consideration of benefits and potential adverse events is required. This review examines the state of glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, and tolerability, as well as the current debate about the safety of GLP-1 RAs, including risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer.METHODS: A MEDLINE search (2010-2015) identified publications that discussed longer-acting GLP-1 RAs. Search terms included GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, efficacy, safety, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer.  Seven trials have been published that have established CV safety for three DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, and sitagliptin), three GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide), and one sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). Three of those studies also established superiority with liraglutide, empagliflozin, and semaglutide at reducing the composite primary endpoint of major CV events (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke).  RECENT FINDINGS: In response to guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration, thousands of patients have been enrolled in large randomized trials evaluating the cardiovascular effects of the three newest diabetes drug classes: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Two studies of GLP-1 receptor agonists-one of liraglutide and one of semaglutide-have shown cardiovascular benefit relative to placebo, and one study of the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin has shown benefit. New antidiabetic drugs are being developed today that expand the range of pharmacological intervention, in particular for patients with type 2 diabetes (imeglimin, semaglutide, dulaglutide, FGF 21 analogue). The effect of semaglutide, a once-weekly human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog in development for type 2 diabetes (T2D), on the bioavailability of a combined oral contraceptive was investigated.  Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was significantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide than among those receiving placebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide. Postmenopausal women with T2D (n = 43) on diet/exercise ± metformin received ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg)/levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) once daily for 8 days before (semaglutide-free) and during (steady-state 1.0 mg) semaglutide treatment (subcutaneous once weekly; dose escalation: 0.25 mg 4 weeks; 0.5 mg 4 weeks; 1.0 mg 5 weeks).

58c6635f02b8c60953000023	What is the inheritance of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance.  The high manifestation of G6PD deficiency in women may be due to the preferential expression of the G6PD-deficient gene and X-inactivation of the normal gene, and/or to the presence of an 'enhancer' gene that makes the expression of the G6PD deficiency more likely.  Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency.  The investigation of the patient's whole family showed the typical recessive X-linked inheritance of this enzyme-defect.  After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology, X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn. T The genetic pattern is consistent with x-linked recessive inheritance and the defect is associated with drug (primaquine) induced haemolysis.  UNLABELLED: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder in which haemolytic anaemia is the major symptom. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is one of the most common human genetic abnormalities, and it has a significant prevalence in the male population (X chromosome linked). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive hemolytic anemia caused by a mutation in the G6PD gene on Xq28. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of G6PD.	['recessive X-linked inheritance']
58861d413b87a8a738000002	Symptoms of which disorder are evaluated with the Davidson Trauma Scale?	Besides, to study its scores' evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in relation to other resilience questionnaires (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 10-item version, Situated Subjective Resilience Questionnaire for Adults and Resiliency Questionnaire for Adults) and to variables such as emotions (Modified Differential Emotions Scale), coping (Person-situation Coping Questionnaire for Adults), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). METHOD: A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors. After correcting for multiple comparisons, no significant effects were observed on any of the outcomes among the NHW sample; however, within the NHB sample, significant gene × environment (G × E) interactions were observed for lifetime PTSD (P = .0029) and PTSD symptom severity (P = .0009). In each case, the APOE ε4 allele had no effect on the outcomes when combat exposure was low; however, when combat exposure was high, an additive effect was observed such that ε4 homozygotes exposed to high levels of combat reported the highest rates of PTSD (92%) and the worst symptom severity scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale (M = 79.5) Early prognostic screening for posttraumatic stress disorder with the Davidson Trauma Scale and the SPAN. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma. The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Davidson trauma scale (DTS-S) and to determine the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a non-clinical random sample of prison inmates.Probabilistic samples of 1,179 inmates from 26 penal institutions in Puerto Rico were selected using a multistage sampling design Remission in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): effects of sertraline as assessed by the Davidson Trauma Scale, Clinical Global Impressions and the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma.  Symptoms were assessed at sequential time points by the Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP), a clinician interview based assessment, and a self-report scale, the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS).  The present study focused on platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentration and symptoms of comorbid depression in war veterans with or without PTSD.PTSD and depression were evaluated using Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Davidson Trauma Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Although rates of trauma and PTSD are higher in those with bipolar disorder than in the general population, little is known about differences across bipolar subtypes.Using the NIMH STEP-BD dataset (N=3158), this study evaluated whether there were baseline differences in the prevalence of PTSD between participants with bipolar disorder I (BDI) and bipolar disorder II (BDII), using the MINI and the Davidson Trauma Scale. We also investigated the interaction between the genetic variants to determine whether these variables and the interactions between the variables influenced the severity of PTSD symptoms.PTSD symptoms were quantitatively assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in 150 participants from an at-risk South African population. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). The Davidson Trauma Scale was completed at 1 (n = 145), 6 (n = 106), 12 (n = 94), and 24 (n = 66) months postdischarge to assess symptoms of PTSD. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a validated, 17-item, brief global assessment scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) in a sample of 56 patients admitted to an emergency room of a general hospital, and assessment of PTSD symptoms in relatives of the patients.

5880dba9c872c95565000009	Which enzyme is inhibited by ribociclib?	Three CDK 4/6 inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of HR(+) breast cancer, including palbociclib (PD 0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219).  The CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics that target the CDK 4/6 kinases that promote transition through the cell cycle. Currently, palbociclib (PD0332991, Pfizer), abemaciclib (LY2835219, Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011, Novartis) are being investigated in clinical trials.  SUMMARY: Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib have demonstrated very promising clinical activity in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma and melanoma. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for their future clinical development. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). The combination of antiestrogen therapy and ribociclib, an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor, led to improved outcomes in women with metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, according to findings presented at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology.  OBJECTIVES: Cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4/6-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway hyperactivation is associated with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC). This study assessed the biological activity of ribociclib (LEE011; CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus letrozole compared with single-agent letrozole in the presurgical setting Importantly, 2 other CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib (LY2835219; Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011; Novartis), are in the late stage of clinical development.  After noting an inverse correlation with sensitivity to ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), we studied the combinatorial effect of these two agents using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, Ki67 immunostaining, timelapse microscopy and xenograft studies. Methods In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease.  Three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.  Clinical Development of the CDK4/6 Inhibitors Ribociclib and Abemaciclib in Breast Cancer. Targeted inhibition of CDK4/6 pathway by small-molecule inhibitors palbociclib (PD-0332991) and ribociclib (LEE011) resulted in inhibition of cell-cycle progression, amelioration of kidney injury, and improved overall survival.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious, often disabling, movement disorder that is caused by medications that block dopamine receptors (i.e., neuroleptics, anti-emetics).  Antipsychotics may cause tardive dyskinesia in humans and orofacial dyskinesia in rodents. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary facial movements induced by chronic therapy with classical antipsychotic medications. The objective of this report is to draw attention to tardive dyskinesia (TD) caused by aripiprazole, a third generation antipsychotic.

58f0b1d670f9fc6f0f000007	What is a miR?	As novel molecules, microRNAs (miRs) take part in regulating protein-coding gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) regulation in tumorigenesis  MiRs are small (~23 nt) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by specifically interacting with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target gene mRNA to repress translation or enhance mRNA cleavage.  The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) has opened an entire new avenue for drug development. These short (15-22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs, which function in RNA silencing and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, have been shown to critically affect numerous pathways in both development and disease progression.

58eb9542eda5a57672000007	Which protein is the main marker of Cajal bodies?	Coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase, complexes that are crucial to pre-messenger RNA splicing and telomere maintenance, respectively Extensive studies have characterized the interaction between coilin and the various other protein components of CBs and related subnuclear domains; however, only a few have examined interactions between coilin and nucleic acid. coilin is tightly associated with nucleic acid, displays RNase activity in vitro, and is redistributed to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-rich nucleoli in cells treated with the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide Here, we report a specific in vivo association between coilin and rRNA, U small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and human telomerase RNA, which is altered upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence of coilin interaction with specific regions of U snRNA gene loci. Additionally, we provide evidence of coilin involvement in the processing of human telomerase RNA both in vitro and in vivo. Coilin, more than a molecular marker of the cajal (coiled) body The Cajal body has now regained the interest of biologists, due to the isolation of a protein marker, coilin. Here, I would like to discuss what we have learned about coilin and suggest a possible role for coilin in RNA processing and cellular trafficking, especially in relation to Cajal bodies and nucleoli.  Coilin-p80 is a marker protein for nuclear Cajal bodies (coiled bodies; CBs) which are also involved in snRNP maturation, storage or transport. Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs). A limited set of NBs also contained coilin, a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs). We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies. Coilin is a marker protein for subnuclear organelles known as Cajal bodies, which are sites of various RNA metabolic processes including the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. Coilin is a marker protein for the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain acting as a site for assembly and maturation of nuclear RNA-protein complexes. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies Cajal bodies (CB) are subnuclear domains that contain various proteins with diverse functions including the CB marker protein coilin Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs) One of these target proteins is coilin; a basic protein located in nuclear Cajal bodies Coilin is known as the marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs), subnuclear domains important for the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) which function in pre-mRNA splicing. Cajal bodies (coiled bodies, CBs) are nuclear organelles of unknown function and are characterized by a wide variety of components including various basal transcription and cell cycle proteins, the nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and Nopp140, numerous small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, the survival motor neuron protein complex, and the marker protein, p80 coilin. Perturbation of SMN function results in disassembly of Cajal bodies and relocalization of the marker protein, coilin, to nucleoli. Human coilin interacting nuclear ATPase protein (hCINAP) directly interacts with coilin, a marker protein of Cajal Bodies (CBs), nuclear organelles involved in the maturation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins UsnRNPs and snoRNPs. hCINAP has previously been designated as an adenylate kinase (AK6), but is very atypical as it exhibits unusually broad substrate specificity, structural features characteristic of ATPase/GTPase proteins (Walker motifs A and B) and also intrinsic ATPase activity. Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs). Cajal bodies (CB) are subnuclear domains that contain various proteins with diverse functions including the CB marker protein coilin. We have found that coilin, the marker protein for Cajal bodies (coiled bodies, CBs), is a self-interacting protein, and we have mapped the domain responsible for this activity to the amino-terminus. Cajal bodies contain a marker protein of unknown function, p80-coilin, and many components involved in transcription and processing of nuclear RNAs. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies. A defect in this activity caused a significant accumulation of the Cajal body marker protein coilin in nucleoli. Coilin, more than a molecular marker of the cajal (coiled) body. We have constructed a stable HeLa cell line, HeLa(GFP-coilin), that expresses the Cajal body marker protein, p80 coilin, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP-coilin). The Cajal body, originally identified over 100 years ago as a nucleolar accessory body in neurons, has come to be identified with nucleoplasmic structures, often quite tiny, that contain coiled threads of the marker protein, coilin. By immunoprecipitation we find that WRAP53 associates with the Cajal body marker coilin, the splicing regulatory protein SMN, and the nuclear import receptor importinβ, and that WRAP53 is essential for complex formation between SMN-coilin and SMN-importinβ.

58cbd0d502b8c60953000035	Which mutated gene causes the Chédiak–Higashi Syndrome?	We detected a homozygous missense mutation (c.4189T>G, p.F1397V) in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which is described as the causative gene for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS).  A frameshift mutation in the LYST gene is responsible for the Aleutian color and the associated Chédiak-Higashi syndrome in American mink. As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene.  LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients.  Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism.  Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. This phenotype is similar to that reported previously in lvsB mutant cells where the ortholog of the LYST gene, involved in CHS, is mutated Rarely, an association of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, Machado-Joseph disease related to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome caused by mutations in ATP13A2 gene, or in hereditary systemic disorders such as Gaucher disease due to mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and Chediak-Higashi syndrome due to LYST gene mutations. LYST is a large cytosolic protein that influences the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and mutation of the encoding gene, LYST, can cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in Japanese Black cattle, caused by a mutation of the Lyst gene. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding LYST protein, the function of which remains poorly understood. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases.	['lysosomal trafficking regulator gene', 'LYST gene']

58e9e7aa3e8b6dc87c00000d	Which is the major RNA editing enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster?	Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. dADAR also re-codes its own transcript, but the consequences of this auto-regulation in vivo are unclear Novel putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, Dalpha5, Dalpha6 and Dalpha7, in Drosophila melanogaster identify a new and highly conserved target of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-mediated A-to-I pre-mRNA editing The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing Aside from their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is not well understood.Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg. The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from a deletion of the paternal genes in the region of chromosome 15q11-q13. In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15.

However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. This contrasts with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in which a similar deletion of the paternally contributed chromosome 15 is observed.

58ea7248eda5a57672000002	What is the phenotype of people carrying mutations in the gene PRDM12?	The evolutionarily conserved transcription factor PRDM12 controls sensory neuron development and pain perception. Here we show that PRDM12 is a key regulator of sensory neuronal specification in Xenopus. Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception.  New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis.   However, the study of genetic disorders rendering individuals completely unable to feel pain offers hope. All causes of congenital painlessness affect nociceptors, evolutionarily conserved specialist neurons able to sense all type of tissue damage. The discovery of new genes essential for sensing pain (SCN11A, PRDM12, and CLTCL1) has provided unexpected insights into the biological mechanisms that drive distinct stages of nociception.

58eb4ce7eda5a57672000004	Which cellular function is associated with transcription factors forkhead 1 and 2 (Fkh1 and Fkh2)?	Forkhead transcription factors establish origin timing and long-range clustering in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. A key function in this process involves the regulation of the cell cycle and stress responses including free radical scavenging. We report that the deletion of both FKH genes impedes normal lifespan and stress resistance, particularly in stationary phase cells, which are non-responsive to caloric restriction. Conversely, increased expression of the FKHs leads to extended lifespan and improved stress response. This study establishes the FKHs role as evolutionarily conserved regulators of lifespan in yeast and identifies the APC as a novel component of this mechanism under certain conditions, likely through combined regulation of stress response, genomic stability, and cell cycle regulation. The genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has four genes that code for proteins containing fork-head domains (FKH), two of which have been characterised. Here we describe the remaining two genes, fhl1 and fkh2, that code for proteins containing fork-head-associated domains (FHA) besides their FKHs. Here we show that the yeast forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, associate with the coding regions of active genes and influence, in opposing ways, transcriptional elongation and termination. Our results suggest that, in addition to their documented promoter function, Fkh1p and Fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation and pre-mRNA processing. This may reflect a general feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Forkhead Box (FOX) proteins, Fkh1 and Fkh2, regulate diverse cellular processes including transcription, long-range DNA interactions during homologous recombination, and replication origin timing and long-range origin clustering.

Frequency of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment or "chemobrain" is mentioned to be significant in literature, although very little is known about the chemotherapy-caused chemobrain and its connection with metal homeostasis alteration. Cognitive decline or dementia is a debilitating problem of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, including special conditions like chemobrain.  Most cancer patients treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy endure long-lasting side effects including decrease in concentration, forgetfulness and slower thinking, which are globally termed "chemobrain."  The frequent use of chemotherapy to combat a range of malignancies can elicit severe cognitive dysfunction often referred to as "chemobrain," a condition that can persist long after the cessation of treatment in as many as 75% of survivors. The term "chemobrain" is sometimes used to denote deficits in neuropsychological functioning that may occur as a result of cancer treatment.

The locations of DAVFs were the transverse-sigmoid sinus in 11, tentorium in 10, cranial vault in 9, and superior sagittal sinus, jugular bulb, foramen magnum, and middle cranial fossa in 1 each. Borden classification was type I in 7, type II in 3, and type III in 24. Transarterial glue embolization is highly effective for Borden type III DAVF with direct cortical venous drainage, but has limitations for Borden type I and II DAVFs in which the affected sinus is part of the normal venous circulation. The results of subtype (Borden and Cognard classification), venous reflux and fistula sites were also accurately exhibited in 4D-CTA. The commonly used Borden and Cognard classification systems for the prediction of clinical behavior of cranial dural arteriovenous shunts focus on the venous drainage, particularly the presence of leptomeningeal venous drainage, and on the direction of flow, particularly the presence of retrograde flow.  The CS DAVFs and the NCS DAVFs were categorized using the Barrow and Borden classification systems, respectively.  The two most commonly used and clinically accepted DAVF classifications are the Merland-Cognard classification and the Borden classification, both based on the morphology of the venous drainage.

We show loss of NBS1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive stage of T cell development, as well as reduced TCRα recombination, that was unexpectedly neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In contrast, loss of both ATMIN and NBS1 enhanced DNA damage that drove spontaneous peripheral T cell hyperactivation, proliferation as well as excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a highly inflammatory environment.

58ee0dd5eda5a57672000013	From which cell type is leptin secreted?	 Although leptin is produced mainly by white adipose tissue, several laboratories have shown low levels of leptin production by a growing number of tissues including the anterior pituitary gland. Lipolysis (stimulated by beta-adrenergic agents) and leptin secretion by adipocytes are down-regulated by neurons in coculture, effects apparently mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) Leptin is mainly produced and secreted by adipocytes, but other tissues and gastric glands have also recently been shown to produce it in a dual (endocrine and exocrine) mode. Leptin was also detected in some microglobules in whole saliva obtained from four healthy volunteers. Co-localization for leptin, leptin receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the same cell type suggested a functional relationship between glucocorticoid hormone and leptin secretion also at the level of the salivary glands. Leptin, a circulating hormone secreted mainly from adipose tissues, possesses protective effects on many cell types. Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone that regulates weight, is known to link lipid metabolism with inflammation in various cell types Leptin, a 16-kDa protein that is mainly secreted by adipocytes, plays a protective role in many cell types Do the adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin affect the granulosa cell expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and its receptor (AMHR-II)?Leptin suppresses AMH mRNA levels in human luteinized granulosa cells through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, while adiponectin has no such effect.AMH is one of the most reliable markers of ovarian reserve Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone, exerts its main function as regulator of food intake and energy expenditure through central effects at the hypothalamic level. Adipokines are a group of fat-secreted hormones and cytokines, including leptin and adiponectin, with important functions in humans. Leptin, an adipose-secreted hormone, links metabolism and immunity. Since the discovery of leptin secreted from adipocytes, specialized tissues and cells have been found that secrete the several peptides (or cytokines) that are characterized to negatively and positively regulate the metabolic process. Adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) secreted from adipose tissue have come to be recognized for their contribution to the mechanisms by which obesity and related metabolic disorders influence breast cancer risk. These results show that there is a distinct female-type and male-type leptin pulsatility pattern and each is amenable to augmentation by gonadal steroids either involving mechanisms that impart leptin pulsatility patterns directly at the level of adipocytes and/or at hypothalamic target sites.. Leptin is a circulating hormone secreted by adipose and a few other tissues. Cyclin D1 is expressed exclusively in luminal keratin 8 immunoreactive tumor cells and is dependent on the adipose secreted hormone leptin. In gastric cells leptin follows a rapid regulated secretion pathway whereas adipocytes secrete leptin in a constitutive slow fashion.	['adipocytes']
589635dd78275d0c4a000009	Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?	LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations. In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a β-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org).

58dcb47c8acda34529000020	What is the role of TAD protein domain?	 Thus, nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation TAD domain located at its C-terminal tail.  Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain.  Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max.  p300 worked synergistically with MRTF-A to activate the transcription of MYH9, MYL9 and CYR61. As identified by co-IP, p300 interacted with the C-terminal TAD domain of MRTF-A. To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. Physical interaction between the transactivation domain (TAD) of the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) and the KIX domain of the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is necessary for MLL-mediated transcriptional activation. The IE62 possesses several domains essential for trans-activation, including an acidic trans-activation domain (TAD), a serine-rich tract (SRT), and binding domains for USF, TFIIB, and TATA box binding protein (TBP) To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. We have characterized two transcription activation domains (TADs) in Da, called activation domain 1 (AD1) and loop-helix (LH), and have evaluated their roles in promoting peripheral neurogenesis. Particularly, the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and transactivation domains (TAD) play essential roles for their coactivating function.

58eb99f3eda5a57672000009	Do origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire early or late?	Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components.  Finally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins.  We propose that by promoting replication fork integrity under these conditions Rad53 ensures centromere duplication.  Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s). Mutations in two of these LCS (linear chromosome stability) genes had little or no effect on the loss rate of a circular YAC that had the same centromere and origin of replication as present on the linear YA Lack of positional requirements for autonomously replicating sequence elements on artificial yeast chromosomes. We find that terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? Because the activation time of individual origins is not an intrinsic property of S. cerevisiae origins, but is influenced by surrounding sequences, we sought to test the hypothesis that centromeres influence replication time by moving a centromere to a late replication domain. Do centromeres ensure their early replication by promoting early activation of nearby origins, or have they migrated over evolutionary time to reside in early replicating regions? In Candida albicans, a neocentromere contains an early firing origin, supporting the first hypothesis but not addressing whether the new origin is intrinsically early firing or whether the centromere influences replication time. cerevisiae replication are conserved: Centromeres replicate early, whereas telomeres replicate late, we found that replication origins both in L.

During this phase, at least 48 genes, collectively named Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, are important for the long-term survival of bacilli under a non-respiring state, a condition that bacilli encounter inside granulomatous lesions. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence.  DosR/DevR of M. tuberculosis is a two component dormancy survival response regulator which induces the expression of 48 genes.

After undergoing urodynamic assessment, pelvic organ prolapse quantification, urine culture, Q-tip test, and stress test, each subject underwent color Doppler ultrasonography to record clitoral blood flow and EMG of the urethral sphincter with a needle electrode inserted through the mucosa into the muscle tissue before surgery.  Preoperatively, patients underwent POP-Q staging, Q-tip test, challenge stress test and urodynamics, and completed the I-QoL, PISQ-12, and PGI-S questionnaires. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients suffering from clinical and/or urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were randomized into biological material TOT (PELVILACE® TO) or synthetic material TOT (ALIGN®TO Urethral Support System) groups. Preoperative and at 1 year postoperative urogynecological symptom assessment, 1-h pad test, 4-day bladder diary, stress test, Q-tip test, and urodynamics were performed.  Role of the Q-tip test in evaluating stress urinary incontinence. Fifteen women with a clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence had a negative Q-tip test (greater than or equal to 30 degrees Q-tip angle change on straining). Simple clinical tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence. PURPOSE To clarify the association between clinically defined simple stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms and urodynamic SUI, we examined the relationship between Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) as measured by the Q-tip test and Stamey grade in simple female SUI. Role of the Q-tip test in evaluating stress urinary incontinence.	['stress urinary incontinence']

It spans approximately 7 kb on chromosome 10 and consists of seven exons. The Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid protein homologous to the amino-terminal domain of the product of the groucho gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split complex The mouse Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid nuclear protein homologous to the amino-terminal domain of the product of the groucho (gro) gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split complex.  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family members. The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. 	['four', '4']

5a7617b183b0d9ea66000022	What is inhibited by a drug rilotumumab?	The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) was targeted in untreated patients in a phase III trial with MoAb rilotumumab, with or without CT, but the study was stopped because of mortality excess in the rilotumumab arm.  AIMS: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody investigated for the treatment of MET-positive gastric cancer.  The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binding antibody rilotumumab (AMG102) was modified for use as a89Zr-based immuno-PET imaging agent to noninvasively determine the local levels of HGF protein in tumors.  Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.  In this phase 1/2 trial, rilotumumab (an anti-HGF antibody) combined with erlotinib was evaluated in patients with metastatic, previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).  Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human, monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G2 against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that blocks the binding of HGF to its receptor MET and has shown trends toward improved survival in a phase 2 clinical trial in gastric cancer. PURPOSE Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody to hepatocyte growth factor. PURPOSE To evaluate the efficacy, safety, biomarkers, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab, a fully human, monoclonal antibody against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor, combined with mitoxantrone and prednisone (MP) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

5a4df811966455904c00000e	Which RNA polymerase II subunit carries RNA cleavage activity?	In contrast, Pol II is fully protected through association with the cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS, which enables rapid recovery from any depth by RNA cleavage. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage.   This mutant enzyme can respond to SII for transcriptional read-through and carry out SII-activated nascent RNA cleavage.  In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription, readthrough or cleavage. In vitro characterization of mutant yeast RNA polymerase II with reduced binding for elongation factor TFIIS. The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II.  Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. The transcription elongation factor S-II, also designated TFIIS, stimulates the nascent transcript cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II itself may contain a Zn ribbon, in as much as the polymerase's 15-kDa subunit contains a sequence that aligns well with the TFIIS Zn ribbon sequence, including a similarly placed pair of acidic residues. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1991) J. Biol. The RNA cleavage activity of RNA polymerase III is mediated by an essential TFIIS-like subunit and is important for transcription termination. In the resulting model of Pol I, the C-terminal ribbon (C-ribbon) domain of A12.2 reaches the active site via the polymerase pore, like the C-ribbon of the Pol II cleavage factor TFIIS, explaining why the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I is strong, in contrast to the weak cleavage activity of Pol II. The amino and carboxyl regions of C11 are homologous to domains of the pol II subunit Rpb9p, and the pol II elongation and RNA cleavage factor, TFIIS, respectively.	['TFIIS']

5a39453d966455904c000006	Which method for subsampling of NGS reads requires only gene counts?	Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the Illumina SBS coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. Interestingly, after subsampling to the same coverage for GSNAP and TopHat, we find that both mappers have similar performance, implying that the advantage of TopHat is mainly an artifact of the lower coverage.  By subsampling sequence reads, we found that when using four-fold biological replication, 6 million reads per condition achieved 96% power to detect a two-fold change (or more) at a 5% false discovery rate. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth subSeq: determining appropriate sequencing depth through efficient read subsampling. We introduce an R package called samExploreR that allows the subsampling (m out of n bootstraping) of short-reads based on SAM files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth related questions for the experimental design. We applied subsampling to ascertain the effect of training sample size and the number of RNA sequencing reads on classification accuracy of molecular subtype and routine biomarker prediction models (unsupervised and supervised). samExploreR: exploring reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq results based on SAM files. By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing experiment and determining where the saturation of power and accuracy occurs, one can determine what the most useful depth should be for future experiments, and furthermore, confirm whether an existing experiment had sufficient depth to justify its conclusions One complication is that the power and accuracy of such experiments depend substantially on the number of reads sequenced, so it is important and challenging to determine the optimal read depth for an experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an existing experiment	['subSeq']
5a4e50b242878bf97d000001	Which topoisomerase is essential in yeast?	Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function. The type II topoisomerase may have an essential role in the compaction and/or segregation of chromosomes during the nuclear division but also complement the defect of the type I enzyme whose major function is the maintenance of chromatin organization throughout the cell cycle. Since DNA topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) is an essential enzyme in yeast, heterologous topoisomerase II gene expression in yeast cells can provide a system for analyzing the structure and function of topoisomerase II genes from other species. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is essential for cell proliferation.  Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous enzyme that removes knots and tangles from the genetic material by generating transient double-strand DNA breaks. While the enzyme cannot perform its essential cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromosomal integrity. Topoisomerase II (Topo II) performs topological modifications on double-stranded DNA molecules that are essential for chromosome condensation, resolution, and segregation.  Type II topoisomerases are essential for resolving topologically entwined double-stranded DNA. A DNA topoisomerases are specialized nuclear enzymes that perform topological modifications on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and hence are essential for DNA metabolism such as replication, transcription, recombination, condensation and segregation. Eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) is the essential decatenase of newly replicated chromosomes and the main relaxase of nucleosomal DNA.  The decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II is essential for viability as eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants indicate that neither topoisomerase I nor II appears to be essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. The gene encoding topoisomerase II in yeast is unique and essential, required for both mitotic and meiotic proliferation. The decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II is essential for viability as eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function..

58f89eb270f9fc6f0f00001a	What is the genetic basis of Ohdo syndrome?	Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c.3443G>A [p.Arg1148His] or c.3493T>C [p.Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified. Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c.5185C>A [p.His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected. The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome. FG syndrome, Lujan syndrome, and Ohdo syndrome, the Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, have been described as distinct syndromes with overlapping non-specific features and different missense mutations of the MED12 gene have been reported in all of them. Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.  To date, these conditions include Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) syndrome, Lujan syndrome, Ohdo syndrome (Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, or OSMKB), and one large family with profound X-linked intellectual disability due to a novel c.5898insC frameshift mutation that unlike the other three syndromes, resulted in affected female carriers and truncation of the MED12 protein.  This case lends credence to the evolving theory that the subtypes of Ohdo, and perhaps other MED12 disorders, reflect a spectrum of characteristics, rather than distinct syndromes. MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels. Finally, direct sequencing of MED12, the gene mutated in Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome and X-linked Ohdo syndrome identified in the two sibs the missense mutation c.3443G>A (p.Arg1148His) inherited from the mother. Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome. Beyond Ohdo syndrome: A familial missense mutation broadens the MED12 spectrum.	['mutations in MED12']

5a88370c61bb38fb24000014	What is the function of the gene MDA5?	Sensing of viral RNA by the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) leads to innate antiviral response.  The host innate immune response to RNA virus infection primarily involves pathogen-sensing toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3 and TLR7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiates rapid innate antiviral responses. MDA5 forms a filament-like multimer along the dsRNA leading to oligomerization, which in turn activates the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to provide a signal platform for the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. The conformational switch of MDA5 causes antiviral defense, but excessive activation of the MDA5-MAVS pathway may result in autoimmune diseases. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, are crucial for host recognition of non-self RNAs, especially viral RNA.

Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8.1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8.1 carriers than non-carriers. The increase in Bacteroidetes was found to be due to an increase in members of the families Bacteroidaceae or Prevotellaceae.  Fecal communities clustered into previously described enterotypes distinguished primarily by levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella. Although the distinction of enterotypes as either discrete clusters or a continuum will require additional investigation, numerous studies have demonstrated the co-exclusion of the closely related Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides genera in the gut microbiota of healthy human subjects where Prevotella appears to be a discriminatory taxon for residence in more agrarian societies Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the active microbiota Specifically, Firmicutes were dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals but significantly decreased in post-gastric-bypass individuals, who had a proportional increase of Gammaproteobacteria. Numbers of the H(2)-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that these two species are members of the family 'Prevotellaceae' but are phylogenetically distant (<88% sequence similarity) from the known genera belonging to this family, including Prevotella, Hallela and Xylanibacter.

Here we show the full domain architecture of human TMEM132 family proteins solved using in-depth sequence and structural analysis. We reveal them to be five previously unappreciated cell adhesion molecules whose domain architecture has an early holozoan origin prior to the emergence of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals. These findings strongly predict a cellular adhesion function for TMEM132 family, connecting the extracellular medium with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. The molecular functions of TMEM132 genes remain poorly understood and under-investigated despite their mutations associated with non-syndromic hearing loss, panic disorder and cancer.

hplc analysis demonstrated that coproporphyrin iii copro iii levels were clearly elevated although the amounts of protoporphyrin were diminished these results indicate that the fluorescent substance was copro iii this study supports the view that excess copro iii synthesis by c aurimucosum and m oxydans leads to accumulation of porphyrin in cutaneous tissue which emits a coral red fluorescence when exposed to wood s light. interdigital foot infections are mostly caused initially by dermatophytes yeasts and less frequently by bacteria erythrasma caused by corynebacterium minutissimum can be confused with superficial mycoses the aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the etiologic agents of superficial mycoses and the frequency of corynebacterium minutissimum in interdigital foot infections all the samples obtained from the 121 patients with interdigital foot infections were examined directly with the use of 20 potassium hydroxide mounts and gram stain under the microscope and cultured on sabouraud s dextrose agar plates in identification of superficial mycoses the rate was found to be 14 with the cultural method and 14 with direct microscopic examination using a combination of direct microscopic examination and culture a 33 8 ratio was achieved in the culture of these samples the most isolated factor was trichophyton rubrum 33 7 in 24 of the patients 19 8 corynebacterium minutissimum was detected by gram staining in 6 of these patients trichophyton rubrum was found trichophyton mentagrophytes was found in 2 and trichosporon spp was found in 1 the examination of interdigital foot lesions in the laboratory the coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and yeast should be considered. exogenous coproporphyrin iii production by corynebacterium aurimucosum and microbacterium oxydans in erythrasma lesions corynebacterium minutissimum is the bacteria that leads to cutaneous eruptions of erythrasma and is the most common cause of interdigital foot infections it is found mostly in occluded intertriginous areas such as the axillae inframammary areas interspaces of the toes intergluteal and crural folds and is more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus than other clinical patients this organism can be isolated from a cutaneous site along with a concurrent dermatophyte or candida albicans infection the differential diagnosis of erythrasma includes psoriasis dermatophytosis candidiasis and intertrigo and methods for differentiating include wood s light examination and bacterial and mycological cultures erythromycin 250mg four times daily for 14 days is the treatment of choice and other antibacterials include tetracycline and chloramphenicol however the use of chloramphenicol is limited by bone marrow suppression potentially leading to neutropenia agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia further studies are needed but clarithromycin may be an additional drug for use in the future where there is therapeutic failure or intertriginous involvement topical solutions such as clindamycin whitfield s ointment sodium fusidate ointment and antibacterial soaps may be required for both treatment and prophylaxis limited studies on the efficacy of these medications exist however systemic erythromycin demonstrates cure rates as high as 100 compared with tetracyclines systemic erythromycin has greater efficacy in patients with involvement of the axillae and groin and similar efficacy for interdigital infections whitfield s ointment has equal efficacy to systemic erythromycin in the axillae and groin but shows greater efficacy in the interdigital areas and is comparable with 2 sodium fusidate ointment for treatment of all areas adverse drug effects and potential drug interactions need to be considered no cost effectiveness data are available but there are limited data on cost related treatment issues a guideline is proposed for the detection evaluation treatment and prophylaxis of this cutaneous eruption. erythrasma is a superficial skin infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum interdigital erythrasma is the most common form and is easily confused with tinea pedis the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis this study was performed between january 1 2011 and january 31 2012 it included 182 patients who presented with concerns about interdigital lesions all of the patients were examined with a wood s lamp and smears were stained with gram s method direct examination with 20 potassium hydroxide was performed of 182 patients with interdigital lesions 73 40 1 were diagnosed as having erythrasma the mean sd age of the patients with erythrasma was 45 52 10 83 years range 22 70 years most of the patients with erythrasma were women 56 2 the most often clinical finding was desquamation using only wood s lamp examination or gram s staining resulted in 31 42 5 or 14 19 2 positive patients respectively using wood s lamp examination and gram s staining concurrently resulted in 28 positive patients 38 4 interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be difficult to differentiate from tinea pedis simple and rapid diagnosis can be made with wood s lamp examination but gram s staining is also a useful method especially in patients with negative wood s lamp examination findings. erythrasma is an uncommon vulvar infection best diagnosed by its fluorescence under the wood lamp this report shows that despite a negative wood lamp examination the diagnosis can be made histologically a 42 year old woman was referred to our clinic with a persistent candidal infection evaluation included a wood lamp examination wet mount and potassium hydroxide test of the affected skin all of which were negative a biopsy of the area demonstrated rods and filamentous organisms in the keratotic layer consistent with a corynebacterium minutissimum infection the patient was diagnosed as having erythrasma and she responded to oral erythromycin persistent vulvar diseases may be caused by erythrasma despite a negative wood lamp examination the diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the lesion. erythrasma is a skin infection which is caused by corynebacterium minutissimum interdigital erythrasma is the most common form the aim of this study was to detect the frequency and risk factors of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis this study was conducted between june and december 2010 and included 122 patients who had interdigital foot lesions all patients were examined using a wood s lamp the smears were stained using gram s method direct examination was performed using 20 potassium hydroxide sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar were used for cultures moreover the demographical characteristics of patients concomitant diseases and clinical findings were also recorded cases that were found to be positive on wood s lamp examination and or gram staining culture were considered as erythrasma the rate of erythrasma was found to be 46 7 the mean age was 43 6 years and the disease was more prevalent in men the most common clinical finding was desquamation mycological examination was found as positive in 40 35 of the patients no growth was observed in bacteriological cultures it was found that using only wood s lamp examination or gram staining resulted in 11 9 and 19 positive patients 15 6 respectively whereas using both wood s lamp examination and gram staining concurrently resulted in 27 positive patients 22 1 interdigital erythrasma is a commonly seen condition and can clinically mimic tinea pedis a wood s lamp is a good diagnostic tool but gram staining particularly in those with a negative wood s lamp result may be a useful method. erythrasma is a superficial infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum and affects the major skin folds and the interdigital regions of the feet it is characterized by erythematous brown scaly patches and maceration and exhibits coral red fluorescence under wood light the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of erythrasma in patients with interdigital lesions an open prospective longitudinal observational study was performed in a hospital in mexico city between march and december 2006 all patients with interdigital lesions were examined with a wood lamp and direct examination was performed with 20 potassium hydroxide cultures were done in sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar and smears were analyzed general characteristics and concomitant diseases were recorded we examined 73 patients of whom 24 32 8 were diagnosed with erythrasma based on coral red fluorescence under wood light and identification of corynebacteria by gram staining the disease was more common in women 83 33 and the mean age of the patients was 43 5 years the main clinical findings were scaling and maceration and the fourth interdigital web was the most commonly affected corynebacterium could not be isolated in any of the cases mycology was positive in 15 cases 62 5 and the following microorganisms were isolated candida 16 6 dermatophytes 12 5 and trichosporon 4 1 interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be easily confused with interdigital tinea it persists if not treated appropriately rapid diagnosis is easily obtained by examination with a wood lamp while culture is difficult and unnecessary for diagnosis the coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and candida should be considered when the interdigital webs are affected. erythrasma is a superficial cutaneous infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum and is characterized by fluorescence under wood s light uv because of the presence of porphyrins these molecules are photosensitizing and we propose to assess efficacy of red light that activates porphyrins photodynamic reaction in treatment of this pathology assessment of effects of photodynamic action of red light for treatment of erythrasma without exogenous photosensitizing molecules thirteen patients with erythrasma were treated by one illumination 80 j cm2 by red light broad band peak at 635 nm without exogenous photosensitizing molecules disappearance or reduction of extent of lesions were observed 2 weeks later if lesions were still present a second irradiation was conducted with the same method preliminary results are presented as a result of red light irradiation we noticed a complete recovery for three patients and in most other cases reduction of extent of lesions mean 29 after one session the treatment was well tolerated we report first cases of photodynamic treatment of erythrasma there are other reports of clinical applications of antimicrobial action of photodynamic therapy in dermatology acne vulgaris leishmaniasis warts etc but there are few applications without addition of exogenous photosensitizing agent the originality and interest of our study is to use spontaneous presence of porphyrins in the lesions this technique seems to be an interesting alternative inexpensive and easy for the treatment of this localized infection but an optimal method is still to be determined to improve efficacy. bacterial skin infections are important to recognize because we have the means to eradicate almost all of them primary skin infections are mainly caused by staphylococci or streptococci staphylococci infections present as furuncles and carbuncles superficial folliculitis impetigo or rarely the scalded skin syndrome streptococcal infections present as impetigo ecthyma erysipelas or cellulitis corynebacteria causes erythrasma trichomycosis or pitted keratolysis gram negative primary skin infections although uncommon may occur bacterial cultures are generally necessary for diagnosis secondary bacterial infections of pre existing wounds burns dermatitic skin or retention cysts are common events. infective embolic retinopathy as a sequela of bacterial endocarditis is described in a 31 year old woman with mitral valve prolapse the infective organism corynebacterium minutissimum has not been previously found to cause ocular or multisystem diseases it is a common mucocutaneous inhabitant which causes erythrasma in our case report both ocular involvement and septicaemia were present the infection was confirmed by positive serial blood cultures mitral valve prolapse was confirmed by echocardiography on clinical examination the retinopathy consisted of white intraretinal lesions which resolved with antibiotic therapy by fluorescein angiography focal areas of hypofluorescence corresponding to the white fundus lesions were present optic disc oedema was also seen.

5a6e4d22b750ff445500004d	Mutations in which gene cause Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia?	SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and growth dysfunctions. The present report describes, for the first time, a Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia child with SMARCAL1 missense mutation (R561H) and manifestations of intussusception secondary to Epstein-Barr virus-negative non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who expired due to septicemia following chemotherapy. Mutations in SWI/SNF2 related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1 (SMARCAL1) gene are responsible for the disease. Sequence analysis revealed that patient was compound heterozygous for two SMARCAL1 mutations: a novel missense change (p.Arg247Pro) and a well-known nonsense mutation (p. Mutations in SMARCAL1, which encodes a DNA annealing helicase with roles in DNA replication fork restart, DNA repair, and gene expression modulation, cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by skeletal dysplasia, renal disease, T-cell immunodeficiency, and arteriosclerosis. Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant autosomal recessive disorder. A novel SMARCAL1 mutation associated with a mild phenotype of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD). SIOD is caused by mutations in the gene SMARCAL1. Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (OMIM 242900) is an uncommon autosomal-recessive multisystem disease caused by mutations in SMARCAL1 (swi/snf-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1), a gene encoding a putative chromatin remodeling protein. Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by defects in SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1 gene (SMARCAL1). Autosomal-recessive Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), T-cell immunodeficiency and facial dysmorphism is caused by defects in the SMARCAL1 gene. OBJECTIVE Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by SMARCAL1 (MIM:20606622) mutations, while in about half of the patients no any mutation in SMARCAL1 could be found. SIOD is caused by mutations in the gene SMARCAL1. mutant chromatin remodeling protein smarcal1 causes schimke immuno osseous dysplasia a novel smarcal1 mutation associated with a mild phenotype of schimke immuno osseous dysplasia siod schimke immuno osseous dysplasia is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with the main clinical features of disproportionate growth deficiency defective cellular immunity and progressive renal disease it is caused by mutations of smarcal1 a gene encoding a putative chromatin remodeling protein of unknown function because a detailed description of the clinical features is an essential first step in elucidating the function of smarcal1 we present the first detailed anthropometric data for schimke immuno osseous dysplasia patients by comprehensive anthropometric examination 28 parameters of 8 patients 3 females with the typical findings of schimke immuno osseous dysplasia mean age 14 8 years range 4 9 30 5 years and 304 patients 117 females with congenital and hereditary chronic kidney disease mean age 10 7 4 8 years range 3 21 8 years we show that schimke immuno osseous dysplasia patients differ significantly from those with other forms of chronic kidney disease z scores were calculated with reference limits derived from 5155 healthy children 2591 females aged 3 to 18 years the key finding was that in the latter group median leg length was significantly more reduced than sitting height whereas in schimke immuno osseous dysplasia patients the reduction of sitting height was significantly more pronounced than for leg length therefore the ratio of sitting height leg length might be a simple tool for the clinician to distinguish schimke immuno osseous dysplasia from other chronic kidney disease patients schimke immuno osseous dysplasia is very likely if this ratio is 0 83 however other forms of chronic kidney disease have to be discussed in case of a ratio 1 01. schimke immuno osseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by defects in swi snf related matrix associated actin dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily a like 1 gene smarcal1 smarcal1 product is a helicase

2 splicing mutations were novel mutations 2 c 1129g c p glu377gln was a snp but not a disease causing mutation at least in chinese population. mutations in smarcal1 which encodes a dna annealing helicase with roles in dna replication fork restart dna repair and gene expression modulation cause schimke immuno osseous dysplasia siod an autosomal recessive disease characterized by skeletal dysplasia renal disease t cell immunodeficiency and arteriosclerosis the clinical features of siod arise from pathological changes in gene expression however the underlying mechanism for these gene expression alterations remains unclear we hypothesized that changes of the epigenome alter gene expression in siod to test this we performed a genetic screen for interaction between marcal1 the drosophila melanogaster ortholog of smarcal1 and the genes of the trithorax group trxg and polycomb group pcg which encode epigenetic regulators smarcal1 and marcal1 genetically interacted with trxg and pcg members a homozygous null mutation of marcal1 suppressed the wing to haltere transformation ectopic ultrabithorax ubx expression and ectopic ubx minigene expression caused by pcg deficiency the suppression of ectopic ubx expression correlated with reduced chromatin accessibility of the ubx promoter to our knowledge this is the first in vivo evidence for deficiency of a smarcal1 ortholog

5a7234352dc08e987e000007	What is the most common histological diagnosis of "butterfly glioma"?	Corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): butterfly glioma. The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings.  Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the independent prognostic factors were Karnofsky Performance Status score ≤70, splenium involvement, and butterfly glioblastoma. Canine Butterfly Glioblastomas: A Neuroradiological Review. All tumors demonstrated classical histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), including glial cell pseudopalisading, serpentine necrosis, microvascular proliferation as well as invasion of the corpus callosum by neoplastic astrocytes. Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Mimicking Butterfly Glioblastoma: A Rare Presentation in the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum. BACKGROUND: Intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland is rare, and metastatic ACC to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma (GBM) has not been reported previously. Diverse molecular pattern in a bihemispheric glioblastoma (butterfly glioma) in a 16-year-old boy. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor of adults, is relatively rare in children. In a GBM affecting a 16-year-old boy, the tumor spread across the corpus callosum (butterfly glioma).  The original "clearcut" diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme, based on CT scans, was unexpectedly disproved by examination of stereotactically obtained brain biopsy specimens, which revealed a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kufs' disease).  The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings. In addition to a large butterfly glioblastoma originating from the frontal part of the corpus callosum, neuropathologic examination revealed a mycotic encephalitis with formation of numerous fungi-containing inflammatory foci in all parts of the brain and in the glioma. Corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): butterfly glioma. When a tumor with adenoid histological features and a "butterfly" phenotype grows in the corpus callosum in a patient with known parotid ACC, both metastasis and adenoid variant GBM should be considered. In a GBM affecting a 16-year-old boy, the tumor spread across the corpus callosum (butterfly glioma). BACKGROUND Intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the parotid gland is rare, and metastatic ACC to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma (GBM) has not been reported previously. the pathologies implicate the bilateral corpus callosum that builds the butterfly pattern on axial view these tumors have seldom been investigated for both clinical manifestations and outcome the objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the butterfly tumor and to identify the predictive factors associated with survival outcome a retrospective study of 50 butterfly tumor was conducted between 2003 and 2016 the clinical characteristics imaging and outcome were assessed for the purpose of descriptive analysis using the kaplan meier method the median overall survival of the butterfly tumor was determined furthermore the cox proportional hazard regression was the estimated hazard ratio for death diffuse large b cell lymphoma was common of butterfly lesions the mortality rate was 78 and overall median survival time was 16 03 months 95 confidence interval 14 0 19 8 using cox proportional hazards regression the independent prognostic factors were karnofsky performance status score 70 splenium involvement and butterfly glioblastoma the butterfly tumor is a poor prognostic disease compared with each histology subgroup further molecular investigation is preferable to explore genetic variations associated with these tumors. a 45 year old male with a butterfly glioma received stereotactic biopsy for histologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis microscopically the results were controversial since some biopsy specimens showed distinct inflammatory changes while others displayed typical features of a malignant glioma the patient died four days after the stereotactic approach due to therapy resistant intracranial pressure rise in addition to a large butterfly glioblastoma originating from the frontal part of the corpus callosum neuropathologic examination revealed a mycotic encephalitis with formation of numerous fungi containing inflammatory foci in all parts of the brain and in the glioma general autopsy disclosed pulmonary aspergillosis as the source of the inflammatory spread a previous steroid medication over several weeks for treatment of increased intracranial pressure may be considered as an important factor in the origin of the pulmonary aspergillosis complicating the butterfly glioma. clinics in diagnostic imaging 175 corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme gbm butterfly glioma a 54 year old man presented with change in behaviour nocturnal enuresis abnormal limb movement and headache of one week s duration the diagnosis of butterfly glioma glioblastoma multiforme was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings as the corpus callosum is usually resistant to infiltration by tumours a mass that involves and crosses the corpus callosum is suggestive of an aggressive neoplasm other neoplastic and non neoplastic conditions that may involve the corpus callosum and mimic a butterfly glioma as well as associated imaging features are discussed. intracranial spread of an adenoid cystic carcinoma acc of the parotid gland is rare and metastatic acc to the splenium of the corpus callosum mimicking butterfly glioblastoma gbm has not been reported previously we report a rare case of metastasis to the splenium of the corpus callosum from acc of the parotid gland the tumor occupied the splenium and mimicked the presentation of a butterfly glioma the patient had undergone parotidectomy 5 years before presentation with this intracranial lesion on magnetic resonance imaging the lesion was separate from the pineal gland and displaced the internal cerebral veins downward ventricular obstruction and increased cellularity were also suggested and multiple fluid filled cystic spaces were observed the tumor was partially resected because the extreme lateral boundary could not be visualized histological analysis with anti c kit antibody showed strong expression of the epithelial component immunohistochemistry with anti p63 antibody revealed nests of positive tumor cells highlighting the myoepithelial component the tumor also stained positive for anti myb antibody the treatment for this lesion is surgical debulking followed by radiation therapy however the overall prognosis remains grim because of limited chemotherapy options and a propensity for recurrence in both local and distant fashions when a tumor with adenoid histological features and a butterfly phenotype grows in the corpus callosum in a patient with known parotid acc both metastasis and adenoid variant gbm should be considered careful clinical and radiological correlation is required to diagnose and treat this rare lesion. the authors report a case of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis kufs disease confirmed by stereotactically obtained brain biopsy findings and initially diagnosed as a butterfly glioma the presenting symptoms in the 64 year old patient were mental alterations with progressive dementia followed by muscular atrophy and myoclonia with distal preponderance the mild initial disturbances of coordination increased and the patient developed a markedly ataxic gait computerized tomography ct scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed generalized cerebral atrophy and a bifrontal space occupying lesion involving the callosum the original clearcut diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme based on ct scans was unexpectedly disproved by examination of stereotactically obtained brain biopsy specimens which revealed a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis kufs disease to the authors knowledge this is the first report of a case presenting with both diffuse brain atrophy and localized accumulation of neuronal lipofuscin mimicking a mass lesion on radiological studies. diverse molecular pattern in a bihemispheric glioblastoma butterfly glioma in a 16 year old boy canine butterfly glioblastomas a neuroradiological review glioblastoma multiforme gbm the most common malignant brain tumor of adults is relatively rare in children in a gbm affecting a 16 year old boy the tumor spread across the corpus callosum butterfly glioma this type of bilateral hemispheric growth has previously been thought to result from spread along the white matter tracts two samples obtained from opposite sides of the same tumor were analyzed comprehensively for loss of heterozygosity loh and microsatellite instability msi amplification of egfr and mdm2 was studied by means of multiplex polymerase chain reaction exons 5 6 7 and 8 of tp53 were screened for mutations by sequencing in neither specimen were molecular alterations found in the egfr mdm2 or tp53 genes the specimen obtained from the right hemisphere exhibited a high level of msi and loh in chromosome arms 5q 9p and 13q the specimen from the left hemisphere exhibited loh in chromosome arms 3p 5q 9p 9q 10p 10q and 13q here we propose four plausible hypothetical scenarios underlying the tumorigenesis of this gbm. in humans high grade gliomas may infiltrate across the corpus callosum resulting in bihemispheric lesions that may have symmetrical winged like appearances this particular tumor manifestation has been coined a butterfly glioma bg while canine and human gliomas share many neuroradiological and pathological features the bg morphology has not been previously reported in dogs here we describe the magnetic resonance imaging mri characteristics of bg in three dogs and review the potential differential diagnoses based on neuroimaging findings all dogs presented for generalized seizures and interictal neurological deficits referable to multifocal or diffuse forebrain disease mri examinations revealed asymmetrical 2 3 or symmetrical 1 3 bihemispheric intra axial mass lesions that predominantly affected the frontoparietal lobes that were associated with extensive perilesional edema and involvement of the corpus callosum the masses displayed heterogeneous t1 t2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery signal intensities variable contrast enhancement 2 3 and mass effect all tumors demonstrated classical histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme gbm including glial cell pseudopalisading serpentine necrosis microvascular proliferation as well as invasion of the corpus callosum by neoplastic astrocytes although rare gbm should be considered a differential diagnosis in dogs with an mri evidence of asymmetric or symmetric bilateral intra axial cerebral mass lesions with signal characteristics compatible with glioma.

5a895f51fcd1d6a10c000004	What is the preferred orientation of CTCF binding sites for chromatin looping?	Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated Conversely, CTCF binding sites in NPCs are largely preexisting in pluripotent stem cells. Only a small number of CTCF sites arise de novo in NPCs.  Moreover, siRNA knockdown ofYy1specifically disrupts interactions between key NPC enhancers and their target genes. YY1-mediated interactions between NPC regulatory elements are often nested within constitutive loops anchored by CTCF As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another.  As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. ccctc binding factor ctcf is an architectural protein involved in the three dimensional 3d organization of chromatin in this study we assayed the 3d genomic contact profiles of a large number of ctcf binding sites with high resolution 4c seq as recently reported our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between ctcf binding sites oriented in a convergent manner to directly test this we used crispr cas9 genome editing to delete core ctcf binding sites in three loci including the ctcf site in the sox2 super enhancer in all instances ctcf and cohesin recruitment were lost and chromatin loops with distal convergent ctcf sites were disrupted or destabilized re insertion of oppositely oriented ctcf recognition sequences restored ctcf and cohesin recruitment but did not re establish chromatin loops we conclude that ctcf binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. we recently used in situ hi c to create kilobase resolution 3d maps of mammalian genomes here we combine these maps with new hi c microscopy and genome editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers domains and loops we find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer combining hi c data and novel mathematical theorems we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule instead we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding in one intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic tension globule in the other ccctc binding factor ctcf and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops however the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the ctcf binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation finally we perform 13 genome editing experiments examining the effect of altering ctcf binding sites on chromatin folding the convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case moreover the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3d maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of ctcf binding sites in the wt thus we show that it is possible to disrupt restore and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.

Three members of a family who died with renal amyloidosis were found to share a single nucleotide substitution in the fibrinogen alpha-chain gene.  A French kindred with autosomal dominant hereditary renal amyloidosis was found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene. Two families with hereditary renal amyloidosis were found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene. The predominant cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis is a mutation of the fibrinogen Aalpha chain (AFib), the most common being the E526V mutation. Discovery of this new mutation confirms the association between fibrinogen A alpha chain variant and hereditary renal amyloidosis and establishes a new biochemical subtype of amyloidosis. Hereditary renal amyloidosis associated with a mutant fibrinogen alpha-chain. Mutations in the fibrinogen Aα-chain genes are the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis. Mutant fibrinogen A-alpha-chain associated with hereditary renal amyloidosis and peripheral neuropathy.

5a86f074faa1ab7d2e00003a	With which cancers has the loss of SMARCB1 been associated?	We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets Genotyping cancer-associated genes in chordoma identifies mutations in oncogenes and areas of chromosomal loss involving CDKN2A, PTEN, and SMARCB1 When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis. SMARCB1/INI1 Involvement in Pediatric Chordoma All 8 cases were positive for brachyury, whereas there was no nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases, including the poorly differentiated chordoma  In this study, we considered immunohistochemistry and SMARCB1/INI1 mutational status to examine SMARCB1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas (7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated) pathogenic involvement of SMARCB1/INI1 in childhood chordoma The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC) Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs) Poorly differentiated chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in pediatric patients Identification of loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in poorly differentiated (PD) chordoma in pediatric patients suggests that PD chordoma is an entity molecularly distinct from conventional chordoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, which is also characterized by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by inactivating mutation of the SMARCB1/INI gene So far, around 20 cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression have been reported Here, we report two cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, which is very rare among the pediatric chordoma types Based on the clival location and histologic findings along with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and positivity for nuclear brachyury staining, the final pathologic diagnosis for both cases was PD chordoma Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs). The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC). loss of smarcb1 ini1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas ccs although mutation loss of 22q has strongly established the loss of smarcb1 ini1 in cancers the cause in ccs remains elusive recent studies suggest role of mirnas in regulation of smarcb1 ini1 expressions we examined 5 reported target predicted mirnas to smarcb1 ini1 in smarcb1 ini1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases and found upregulation of mir 671 5p and mir 193a 5p in smarcb1 ini1 immunonegative cases notably these two mirnas were significantly predicted to target tgf β signaling suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in ccs overall we suggest mir 671 5p and mir 193a 5p mediated epigenetic mode of smarcb1 ini1 loss and downregulated tgf β pathway in ccs. smarcb1 ini1 involvement in pediatric chordoma a mutational and immunohistochemical analysis chordomas arise in the skull base and spine and usually occur in adults and are rare in the pediatric population cases of chordoma in pediatric age are often poorly differentiated showing cytologic atypia increased cellularity and mitosis and their aggressive behavior is associated with a high incidence of metastatic spread and a short patient survival recent studies have described loss of smarcb1 ini1 protein in poorly differentiated chordomas associated not with point mutations but with smarcb1 ini1 gene deletions instead in this study we considered immunohistochemistry and smarcb1 ini1 mutational status to examine smarcb1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas 7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated we performed immunohistochemical tests for ini1 brachyury s100 and cytokeratins and conducted a genetic analysis on the smarcb1 coding sequence nm 003073 using the sanger method and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to detect abnormal copy numbers of the gene locus all 8 cases were positive for brachyury whereas there was no nuclear smarcb1 ini1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases including the poorly differentiated chordoma genetic analysis identified a missense mutation in 2 cases and a nonsense mutation associated with loss of smarcb1 ini1 protein and features of poorly differentiated tumor in 1 these mutations were novel variants occurring in heterozygosity and they were judged to be pathogenic by 3 different bioinformatic tools in 7 of 8 cases we performed multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification and 3 cases showed deletions at the smarcb1 locus our results confirm the pathogenic involvement of smarcb1 ini1 in childhood chordoma we also describe 3 novel pathogenic mutations.

5a742d620384be9551000002	Which disease risk can be estimated with the Stop-Bang questionnaire?	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of "apple body type" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CONCLUSION: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.  High and low probability of OSA were defined as a STOP-Bang score of ≥5 (h-OSA) and of<5 (l-OSA), respectively. The STOP-BANG questionnaire improves the detection of epilepsy patients at risk for obstructive sleep apnea. We performed a quality improvement project, evaluating for improvements in the screening of OSA in epilepsy patients using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  Diagnostic accuracy of the Berlin questionnaire, STOP-BANG, STOP, and Epworth sleepiness scale in detecting obstructive sleep apnea: A bivariate meta-analysis. Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial.  Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable. Modified Mallampati Score Improves Specificity of STOP-BANG Questionnaire for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. BACKGROUND: An accurate, clinical screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that identifies patients for further diagnostic testing would assist in the diagnosis of this comorbidity. One example, the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), has been validated as a screening tool with high sensitivity. The validated Berlin, STOP-BANG, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires were administered to all eligible subjects to assess SA risk and daytime somnolence, and their demographic and clinical information, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of depression were collected using the questionnaires. Ninety-nine (49.5%) subjects were identified as high risk for SA using the Berlin questionnaire, whereas 26 (13%), 137 (68.5%), and 37 (18.5%) subjects were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk for SA, respectively, using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  CONCLUSIONS: The SACS and the STOP-Bang questionnaires (BMI threshold of 25 kg/m2) were found to provide the best positive and negative LRs, respectively, for the prediction of OSA. The aims of this study were to (1) explore the incidence of right-sided heart dysfunction (RHD) and STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and (2) assess the relationship between patients with STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with OSA and echocardiographic findings suggestive of RHD. This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. Validation of the STOP-Bang Questionnaire as a Screening Tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Different Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Validation of a Portuguese version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea: Analysis in a sleep clinic. This meta-analysis confirms the high performance of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in the sleep clinic and surgical population for screening of OSA. <b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</b>: The present review aims to provide an update on the various practical applications of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in anesthesia, surgery, and perioperative medicine.<br><b>RECENT FINDINGS</b>: The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0--2 can be classified as low-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Further, patients with a STOP-Bang score at least 3 can be classified as high risk for moderate-to-severe OSA if the serum HCO3 at least 28 mmol/l. STOP-Bang can be used as a novel tool for perioperative risk stratification because it easily identifies patients who are at increased risk of perioperative complications.<br><b>SUMMARY</b>: STOP-Bang at least 3 was recommended previously to identify the suspected or undiagnosed OSA. Because of its practical application, STOP-Bang is a useful screening tool for patients with suspected or undiagnosed OSA.<br> The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3. Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk. Evaluation of the Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea. The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients. Alternative scoring models of STOP-bang questionnaire improve specificity to detect undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic. This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. This study aimed to compare the efficiency of the STOP-BANG and Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaires for evaluating potential respiratory complications during the perioperative period. OBJECTIVE The STOP-Bang questionnaire was developed as a quick and simple screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preoperative clinics. This study aimed to evaluate and validate the Arabic version of Stop-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for patients with OSA symptoms referred to a sleep clinic. RESULTS Eighty-three out of 200 patients had a high risk of OSA based on the STOP-Bang questionnaire. CONCLUSION The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic. RECENT FINDINGS The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We aimed to evaluate the validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire to predict moderate-to-severe and severe OSA in the general population. STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine if a high score (≥ 3) on the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicts whether obese patients are at high risk for OSA and increased risk of difficult airway. CONCLUSION The STOP-Bang questionnaire can be used as a screening tool in the general population in view of its moderate sensitivity and high negative predictive value for subjects with moderate-to-severe and severe OSA. Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of AR and the STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness during daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender), a validated screening method to identify obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3. The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients. PURPOSE This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Over 40% of MS patients were identified as high risk for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The high-risk group patients identified by STOP-BANG had significantly higher respiratory disturbance index and lower minimum oxygen saturation than the low-risk group patients.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Among the four questionnaires studied, STOP-BANG, with only eight questions and the highest sensitivity, is the best questionnaire of the four for OSA screening. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: The present study validates and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of four internationally popular questionnaires, translated into Chinese, for assessing suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, namely, the Berlin questionnaire, the ASA checklist, the STOP questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. We hypothesized that the STOP-Bang questionnaire, a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can predict difficult intubation.<br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b>: In this prospective cohort study, 200 adult surgical patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied to evaluate the usefulness of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for predicting difficult intubation.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene and the spectrum of mutations among Greek-Cypriots with FMF-related symptoms was examined Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic periodic fever syndrome and characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, serositis, arthritis, dermal manifestations, and long-term renal complications. The MEFV gene was described in 1997 as the gene responsible for FMF and is inherited in autosomal recessive manner. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in theMEFVgene  MEditerranean FeVer (MEFV) gene encodes for the pyrin protein and a mutated pyrin is associated with a prolonged or augmented inflammation. The causative mutations for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) are located in the MEFV gene, which encodes pyrin. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), characterized by recurrent fever and inflammation of serous membranes, is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene.   patients affected by familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) whether or not interleukin (IL)-1β secretion (1) is enhanced, (2) correlates with the type of MEFV mutation and (3) is mediated by NLRP3 Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive inherited autoinflammatory syndrome. Patients with FMF have symptoms such as recurrent fever and abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by arthralgia. Biopsy specimens have revealed substantial neutrophil infiltration into synovia. FMF patients have a mutation in the Mediterranean fever gene, encoding pyrin, Atherosclerosis is the main pathogenesis. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease. The gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, encodes a protein called pyrin or marenostrin Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disorder due to MEFV mutations and one of the most frequent Mediterranean genetic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical findings and the most common mutated alleles of MEFV gene in a childhood population and to determine the sensitivity of the 12-mutation-strip assay test in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has been traced to mutations in the MEFV gene.

5a6f960fb750ff445500005c	Centor criteria are used for which disease?	Methods: MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. METHODS: Trained pharmacy staff assessed patients presenting with a sore throat using the Centor scoring system and patients meeting three or all four of the criteria were offered a throat swab test for Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococci.  CONCLUSION: Clinician judgement and Centor score are inadequate tools for clinical decision-making for children presenting with sore throat.  A Study to Determine if Addition of Palatal Petechiae to Centor Criteria Adds More Significance to Clinical Diagnosis of Acute Strep Pharyngitis in Children. Objective. A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children. Hypothesis. In children, Centor Criteria does not cover all the symptoms and signs of acute strep pharyngitis. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children.  Conclusion. Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. Appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria. Objective To ascertain the appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria and to identify factors related to antibiotic dispensing. Main outcome measure The appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis according to the original and modified Centor criteria and determinants of antibiotic dispensing including demographic characteristics of pharmacists, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs on antibiotic dispensing.  Conclusion Pharmacists who are knowledgeable on the Centor criteria are more likely to appropriately diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis and less likely to dispense antibiotics in such case. Adult men and women, youth and children ≥6 years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study.  Previous studies have shown that the Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat.  Spectrum bias was present, inasmuch as RADT sensitivity increased with Centor scores, ie, 47% sensitivity among children with 0 Centor criteria, 65% among those with 1 criterion, 82% among those with 2 criteria, and 90% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The sensitivity of RADT for GABHS pharyngitis is not a fixed value but varies with the severity of disease. The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria. However, even among pediatric patients with > or =3 Centor criteria for GABHS pharyngitis, the sensitivity of RADT is still too low to support the use of RADT without culture confirmation of negative results.<br> A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children. if Addition of Palatal Petechiae to Centor Criteria Adds More Significance to Clinical Diagnosis of Acute Strep Pharyngitis in Children. Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. INTRODUCTION Centor criteria (fever >38.5°C, swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate and absence of cough) are an algorithm to assess the probability of group A β haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) as the origin of sore throat, developed for adults. appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among thai community pharmacists according to the centor criteria Diagnosing GABHS (Group A-beta Hemolytic Streptococcus) tonsillopharyngitis by clinical scoring is a recommended approach in developed countries, but there is still much controversy for low resource settings.We aimed to assess the impact of Centor criteria with the support of practical laboratory tests.We prospectively included patients complaining sore throat (N = 282). We evaluated them in terms of Centor scoring and performed white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), rapid antigen detecting test, and throat culture.In GABHS cases (N = 32, 11·3%), two of the criteria were observed to be positive in more than half of the cases (N = 19, 59·3%), while 13 (40·7%) cases met three/four criteria. The specificity of having two criteria was found to be 65·5% and increased to 91·5% after including CRP and WBC.Centor criteria could be safely used to reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage for tonsillopharyngitis in developing countries. Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is often performed for diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis among children. Among adults, the sensitivity of this test varies on the basis of disease severity (spectrum bias). A similar phenomenon may occur when this test is used in a pediatric population, which may affect the need for culture confirmation of all negative RADT results.To assess the performance of a clinical scoring system and to determine whether RADT spectrum bias is present among children who are evaluated for GABHS pharyngitis.Laboratory and clinical records for a consecutive series of pediatric patients who underwent RADT at the Marshfield Clinic between January 2002 and March 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified according to the number of clinical features present by using modified Centor criteria, ie, history of fever, absence of cough, presence of pharyngeal exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of the RADT was defined as the number of patients with positive RADT results divided by the number of patients with either positive RADT results or negative RADT results but positive throat culture results.RADT results were positive for 117 of 561 children (21%), and culture results were positive for 35 of 444 children (8%) with negative RADT results. The overall prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 27% (95% confidence interval: 23-31%). The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria. Spectrum bias was present, inasmuch as RADT sensitivity increased with Centor scores, ie, 47% sensitivity among children with 0 Centor criteria, 65% among those with 1 criterion, 82% among those with 2 criteria, and 90% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.The sensitivity of RADT for GABHS pharyngitis is not a fixed value but varies with the severity of disease. However, even among pediatric patients with > or =3 Centor criteria for GABHS pharyngitis, the sensitivity of RADT is still too low to support the use of RADT without culture confirmation of negative results. Centor criteria (fever >38.5°C, swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate and absence of cough) are an algorithm to assess the probability of group A β haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) as the origin of sore throat, developed for adults. We wanted to evaluate the correlation between Centor criteria and presence of GABHS in children with sore throat admitted to our paediatric emergency department (PED).Retrospective cohort study.The emergency department of a large tertiary university hospital in Brussels, with over 20 000 yearly visits for children below age 16.All medical records (from 2008 to 2010) of children between ages 2 and 16, who were diagnosed with pharyngitis, tonsillitis or sore throat and having a throat swab culture for GABHS. Children with underlying chronic respiratory, cardiac, haematological or immunological diseases and children who had already received antibiotics (AB) prior to the PED consult were excluded. Only records with a full disease history were selected. Out of a total 2118 visits for sore throats, 441 met our criteria. The children were divided into two age groups, 2-5 and 5-16 years.The prevalence of GABHS was higher in the older children compared to the preschoolers (38.7 vs 27.6; p=0.01), and the overall prevalence was 32%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of GABHS for all different Centor scores within an age group. Likelihood ratios (LR) demonstrate that none of the individual symptoms or a Centor score of ≥3 seems to be effective in ruling in or ruling out GABHS. Pooled LR (CI) for Centor ≥3 was 0.67 (CI 0.50 to 0.90) for the preschoolers and 1.37 (CI 1.04 to 1.79) for the older children.Our results confirm the ineffectiveness of Centor criteria as a predicting factor for finding GABHS in a throat swab culture in children. The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length. A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children.In children, Centor Criteria does not cover all the symptoms and signs of acute strep pharyngitis. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children.One hundred patients with a complaint of sore throat were enrolled in the study. All the patients were examined clinically using the Centor Criteria. They were also examined for other signs and symptoms like petechial lesions over the palate, abdominal pain, and skin rash. All the patients were given rapid strep tests, and throat cultures were sent. No antibiotics were given until culture results were obtained.The sample size was 100 patients. All 100 had fever, sore throat, and erythema of tonsils. Twenty of the 100 patients had tonsillar exudates, 85/100 had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and 86/100 had no cough. In total, 9 out of the 100 patients had positive throat cultures. We observed that petechiae over the palate, a very significant sign, is not included in the Centor Criteria. Palatal petechiae were present in 8 out of the 100 patients. Six out of these 8 with palatal petechiae had positive throat culture for strep (75%). Only 7 out of 20 with exudates had positive strep culture. Sixteen out of the 100 patients had rapid strep test positive. Those 84/100 who had negative rapid strep also had negative throat culture.We used Fisher's exact test, comparing throat culture positive and negative versus presence of exudates and palatal hemorrhages with positive and negative throat cultures and the resultant P value <.0001.Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. we evaluate the test characteristics and test for spectrum bias of a rapid antigen test for group a beta hemolytic streptococcal gabhs pharyngitis among adults medical record and laboratory results of consecutive adult patients receiving a rapid antigen test for gabhs in the emergency department or urgent care clinic of an urban teaching hospital between august 1999 and december 1999 were analyzed patients were stratified according to the number of clinical features present using the following modified centor criteria history of fever absence of cough presence of pharyngeal exudate and cervical lymphadenopathy the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was defined as the number of patients with positive rapid

sore throat is a common presentation in primary care settings we aimed to improve our compliance with national antibiotic guidelines for sore throat symptoms to 90 in 3 months time period the national guidelines are based on centor criteria a retrospective audit of 102 patient records with sore throat symptoms presenting between 1 january to 30 december 2015 showed that over 50 were given antibiotics those who were prescribed antibiotics 27 did not meet nice criteria and 85 of patients were given immediate antibiotic prescription centor criteria was documented in just 2 of cases compliance with correct antibiotic course length was 15 antibiotic choice and dose was correct in 94 and 92 of cases respectively antibiotic frequency was correctly prescribed in 100 of patients we introduced interventions that included oral and poster presentations to multidisciplinary team dissemination of guidelines through internal e mail and systemic changes to gp electronic patient record system emis this involved creating an automated sore throat template and information page on re auditing of 71 patients after two pdsa cycles compliance with nice criteria was 87 with a significant reduction in immediate prescribing 66 centor criteria documentation was 42 correct antibiotic course length was prescribed in over 30 of cases other antibiotic regimen parameters choice dose and frequency were correct in 100 of cases the initial results demonstrated that significant changes were needed in particular reducing the amount of antibiotics prescribed by increasing compliance with nice criteria and ensuring all parameters of antibiotic prescription were correct we showed that significant sustainable improvement is achievable through carefully devised automated systemic changes that provides critical information in readily accessible format and does not solely rely on prescribers knowledge and initiative the outcome of these interventions are a decrease in immediate antibiotic prescription significant increase in centor criteria documentation and an increase in compliance with the correct course length of antibiotics all these measures would contribute to reduction in antimicrobial resistance and improvement in patient care in the community future work must focus on improving compliance with correct antibiotic course length.

5a6d08d5b750ff445500002c	Which stapled peptide has been designed to target Ctf4?	The Ctf4/AND-1 protein hub, which links DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation, represents a novel target for the synthetic lethality approach. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and validation of double-click stapled peptides encoding the Ctf4-interacting peptide (CIP) of the replicative helicase subunit Sld5. By screening stapling positions in the Sld5 CIP, we identified an unorthodox i,i+6 stapled peptide with improved, submicromolar binding to Ctf4. The mode of interaction with Ctf4 was confirmed by a crystal structure of the stapled Sld5 peptide bound to Ctf4. The stapled Sld5 peptide was able to displace the Ctf4 partner DNA polymerase α from the replisome in yeast extracts. Our study provides proof-of-principle evidence for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of the human CTF4 orthologue AND-1.

5a70e4b399e2c3af26000008	Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir are used for tratment of which disease?	Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks for hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection and prior direct-acting antiviral treatment. This phase 2, open-label study (MAGELLAN-1) evaluated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir (GLE) + pibrentasvir (PIB) ± ribavirin (RBV) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients with prior virologic failure to HCV DAA-containing therapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of GLE and PIB was highly efficacious and well tolerated in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and prior failure of DAA-containing therapy; RBV coadministration did not improve efficacy. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir yield high response rates in patients with HCV genotype 1-6 without cirrhosis. The efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatments with glecaprevir (ABT-493; NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530; NS5A inhibitor) were evaluated in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir was well tolerated and achieved high sustained virologic response rates in HCV genotypes 1-6-infected patients without cirrhosis following 8- or 12-week treatment durations.LAY SUMMARY: The combination of direct-acting antivirals glecaprevir and pibrentasvir comprise a once-daily, all-oral, pangenotypic treatment for HCV genotype 1-6 infection.  Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents being developed as combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.  The combination of glecaprevir (formerly ABT-493), a nonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir (formerly ABT-530), an NS5A protein inhibitor, is being developed as treatment for HCV genotype 1 to 6 infection.  <b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE</b>: Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

This article summarizes the milestones in the development of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir leading to its first global approval in the EU and subsequent approval in the USA for chronic HCV infection.<br> We evaluated the safety and efficacy of 8 and 12 weeks' treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with HCV genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis in 3 separate phase 3 trials.<br><b>METHODS</b>: We performed 2 open label, single-arm studies (SURVEYOR-II, Part 4 and ENDURANCE-4) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENDURANCE-2). Among patients receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, rates of SVR12 were 99.5% (95% CI, 98.5-100) in those infected with HCV genotype 2 and 99% (95% CI, 97.6-100) in those infected with HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6. Treatment with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks resulted in a high rate of sustained virologic response in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and HCV infection. Coadministration of glecaprevir 400 mg increased pibrentasvir 120 and 40 mg steady-state C and AUC values to 2.9-6.3-fold, and coadministration of glecaprevir 700 mg increased pibrentasvir 160 mg steady-state C and AUC values to up to sevenfold of the values when pibrentasvir was administered alone. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the combination of the NS3/4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir and the NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir for 12 weeks in adults who had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and also had compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) with severe renal impairment, dependence on dialysis, or both.

In brain homogenates with Aβo, the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is reversed by mGluR5-directed antagonists or antibodies directed against the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153. Silent allosteric modulators of mGluR5 do not alter Glu or basal mGluR5 activity, but they disrupt the Aβo-induced interaction of mGluR5 with PrP(C) The assays described here have the potential to identify and develop new compounds that inhibit the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by transmitting the signal from extracellular Aβo into the cytosol. Silent Allosteric Modulation of mGluR5 Maintains Glutamate Signaling while Rescuing Alzheimer's Mouse Phenotypes. Our data show that mGluR5's role in Aβo-dependent AD phenotypes is separate from its role in glutamate signaling and silent allosteric modulation of mGluR5 has promise as a disease-modifying AD intervention with a broad therapeutic window.

5a8718c861bb38fb24000008	What are check point inhibitors?	 Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways.  These next generation agents with novel mechanisms of action as well as targeted therapies are being used both in the preclinical and clinical settings for patients with myeloma. These agents include monoclonal antibodies, deacetylase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, agents affecting various signaling pathways, immune check point inhibitors, and other targeted therapies Immune check point inhibitors may be of critical importance for the design of future immunotherapy approaches in GBM management. Immune check-point inhibitors should be considered a promising treatment option in GBM. Immune check-point inhibitors are now employed as single-agents in current practice for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while combinations of different inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials. Check point antibody inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, are a novel class of inhibitors that function as a tumor suppressing factor via modulation of immune cell-tumor cell interaction. The recent successes of immune check point targeting therapies in treating cancer patients has driven a resurgence of interest in targeting these pathways in chronically infected patients. These checkpoint blockers are rapidly becoming a highly promising cancer therapeutic approach that yields remarkable antitumor responses with limited side effects. The survival of tumors in several cases is assisted by checkpoint immunomodulation to maintain the imbalance between immune surveillance and cancer cell proliferation. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. The treatment of melanoma is evolving rapidly over the past few years. Patients with BRAFv600 mutations can be treated with a combination of a BRAF-inhibitor and an MEK-inhibitor. Patients with BRAF wild-type tumors and BRAFv600 mutated tumors can be treated with immunotherapy i.e. check point inhibitors. Till now, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer looked dreadful; thus the search for newer better approaches for this lethal disease has been a strategic target for cancer researchers. In recent years, important immunobiological aspects of the tumor have been revealed with the subsequent proposal of immune check point inhibitors to target these pathways. Inhibitory receptors on immune system cells respond to membrane-bound and soluble ligands to abort or mitigate the intensity of immune responses by raising thresholds of activation, halting proliferation, favoring apoptosis or inhibiting/deviating effector function differentiation. Such evolutionarily selected inhibitory mechanisms are termed check-points and therefore check-point inhibitors empower any ongoing anti-cancer immune response that might have been too weak or exhausted.

5a75f6e083b0d9ea66000009	Which data simulator is available for CLIP-SEQ experiments?	CSEQ-SIMULATOR: A DATA SIMULATOR FOR CLIP-SEQ EXPERIMENTS. CLIP-Seq protocols such as PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP or iCLIP allow a genome-wide analysis of protein-RNA interactions. For the processing of the resulting short read data, various tools are utilized. Some of these tools were specifically developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.

The readers assessed the presence of specific air distributions on CT (periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs). RESULTS: All specific air distributions were more frequently present in patients with gastroduodenal perforation than lower GI tract perforation, but only the falciform ligament sign was statistically significant (p<0.05). Regardless of the perforation sites, the falciform ligament sign was present significantly more frequently with an increase in the amount of free air on multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; p<0.001).  To evaluate the usefulness of the PPFA sign, we compared the PPFA sign with the falciform ligament sign and the ligamentum teres sign, both of which are well-known CT signs of pneumoperitoneum.  The falciform ligament sign was seen in 24 of 30 (80%) patients with upper GI tract perforation and in 10 of 23 (43%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p=.020).  Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant).  Forty-two patients with 10 cases of proximal GI perforation and 32 cases of distal GI perforation were evaluated based on the CT findings of extraluminal air (which was subdivided into the CT-falciform ligament sign crossing the midline and scattered pockets of air), bowel wall thickening (>8 mm in gastroduodenal wall,>3 mm in the small bowel wall,>6 mm in the caliber of the appendix and>5 mm in the colonic wall), associated abscess formation, ascites and adjacent fat stranding. Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P<.05).  Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P<.05). The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine what gives rise to the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract perforation, and whether these specific air distributions can play a clinically meaningful role in the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation. The PPFA sign is a useful finding which can help to distinguish upper from lower GI tract perforation. Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant).

5a6fa31ab750ff445500005e	Which method has been developed for assignment of enhancers to target genes?	McEnhancer: predicting gene expression via semi-supervised assignment of enhancers to target genes. While genomic assays can identify putative enhancers en masse, assigning target genes is a complex challenge. We devised a machine learning approach, McEnhancer, which links target genes to putative enhancers via a semi-supervised learning algorithm that predicts gene expression patterns based on enriched sequence features. Predicted expression patterns were 73-98% accurate, predicted assignments showed strong Hi-C interaction enrichment, enhancer-associated histone modifications were evident, and known functional motifs were recovered. Our model provides a general framework to link globally identified enhancers to targets and contributes to deciphering the regulatory genome.

5a871a6861bb38fb24000009	What disease is the ALK tyrosine kinase associated with?	ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a T-cell lymphoma usually occurring in children and young adults. I  A 62-year-old Caucasian non-smoking woman was diagnosed with cT4N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma investigational ALK inhibitor brigatinib is active in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, initially identified through the analysis of a specific translocation associated with a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently it was demonstrated that ALK is frequently mutated in sporadic cases with advanced neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an important molecular target in neuroblastoma. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogating ALK activity are currently in clinical use for the treatment of ALK-positive (ALK(+)) disease, monotherapy with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors may not be an adequate solution for ALK(+) neuroblastoma patients. Insights into ALK-driven cancers revealed through development of novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. The ALK gene is silent in adult tissues except for restricted sites within the nervous system (consequently, patients with ALK-positive lymphoma produce antibodies to the ALK protein) but is expressed in some neuroblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. BACKGROUND The translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene on chromosome 2p have been identified in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) as oncogenic driver mutations. SUMMARY The ALK protein functions as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase; rearrangements of the ALK gene are associated with the development of NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement lung cancer responds to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor, has been initially identified through its involvement in chromosomal translocations associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements can derive significant clinical benefit from ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Two ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib and ceritinib, are currently approved in Europe for use in ALK-positive NSCLC and several others are in development. This review summarises the latest research on the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, and how this information can guide the management of patients with cancer that is ALK-positive. Genetic rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene occur in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomoas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and other cancers. <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: NSCLC with de novo anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements and EGFR or KRAS mutations co-occur very rarely. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to treatment with an ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (-TKI). The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase was initially discovered as a component of the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene originally discovered nearly 20 years ago in the context of anaplastic large cell lymphoma were identified as oncogenic drivers in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in 2007. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement identifies a population of NSCLCs in whom dysregulation of ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, ALK has been identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas.  Rearrangements in ALK gene and EML4 gene were first described in 2007. This genomic aberration is found in about 2%-8% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is a T cell lymphoma defined by the presence of chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene.  Renal Medullary Carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive malignancy that affects young black individuals with sickle cell trait. No effective treatment is available, resulting in an ominous clinical course, with overall survival averaging less than four months. We report rearrangement of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in a pediatric case of RMC harboring a t(2;10)(p23;q22) translocation  Aberrant ALK activity has been implicated in the oncogenesis of human cancers as a fusion protein in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, systemic histiocytosis and NSCLC or through mutations in the full length protein in hereditary familial neuroblastoma.  Chromosomal rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) occur in a variety of human malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. NPM/ALK is an oncogenic fusion protein expressed in approximately 50% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases. It derives from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with the dimerization domain of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) protein. Rearrangements involving the ALK gene were identified in a variety of cancers, genetic alterations are mutations in the kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which have been found in both somatic and familial neuroblastom  The aim of this study is to investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein expression and underlying genetic aberrations in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), with special attention to clinical and prognostic implications Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) fusion is a distinct molecular subclassification of NSCLC that is targeted by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors.  The discovery of translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers has become a paradigm for precision medicine The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in the pathogenesis of different types of human cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB)	['cancer']
5a67ab79b750ff445500000b	CURB65 score is used for stratification of which disease?	Severity assessment tools (e.g. CURB65) that are used to guide early management decisions in CAP have not been widely validated in low-income settings and locally adapted tools are required.  Scores for the pneumonia severity index (PSI); CURB65 (confusion, urea, respiration, blood pressure; age>65 years); Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for severe CAP; Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); and quick SOFA (qSOFA) were calculated. Prognostic performance of MR-pro-adrenomedullin in patients with community acquired pneumonia in the Emergency Department compared to clinical severity scores PSI and CURB. AIM: (i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification.  The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA.  The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. The CURB65 pneumonia severity score outperforms generic sepsis and early warning scores in predicting mortality in community-acquired pneumonia. CURB65 should not be supplanted by SIRS or SEWS for initial prognostic assessment in CAP. The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. We aimed to derive a practical algorithm combining the CURB65 score with ProADM-levels in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-CAP-LRTI. RESULTS CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI. The combined CURB65-A risk score provided better prediction of death and adverse events than the CURB65 score in the entire cohort and in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI patients. CONCLUSION Presepsin is a valuable biomarker in predicting severity and outcome in CAP patients in the ED and Presepsin in combination with CURB65 score significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy. BACKGROUND An intervention trial found a trend for shorter length of stay (LOS) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when the CURB65 score was combined with the prognostic biomarker proadrenomedullin (ProADM) (CURB65-A). A composite score (CURB65-A) was created combining CURB65 classes with ProADM cut-offs to further risk-stratify patients.<br><b>RESULTS</b>: CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI.

5a6d196db750ff4455000032	Which resource has been developed in order to study the transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate?	Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines: a Data and Tool Resource to Study Transcriptional Regulation of GABAergic Cell Fate. Elucidating the transcriptional circuitry controlling forebrain development requires an understanding of enhancer activity and regulation. We generated stable transgenic mouse lines that express CreERT2and GFP from ten different enhancer elements with activity in distinct domains within the embryonic basal ganglia. We used these unique tools to generate a comprehensive regional fate map of the mouse subpallium, including sources for specific subtypes of amygdala neurons. We then focused on deciphering transcriptional mechanisms that control enhancer activity. Using machine-learning computations, in vivo chromosomal occupancy of 13 transcription factors that regulate subpallial patterning and differentiation and analysis of enhancer activity in Dlx1/2 and Lhx6 mutants, we elucidated novel molecular mechanisms that regulate region-specific enhancer activity in the developing brain. Thus, these subpallial enhancer transgenic lines are data and tool resources to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.

5a7877c0faa1ab7d2e00000c	What is the first line treatment for sarcoidosis?	Sarcoidosis represents a non-caseating, granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology whose clinical manifestation is heterogeneous and frequently multisystemic. The portion of patients needing systemic treatment varies: though many patients may undergo spontaneous remission, organ-threatening courses demand systemic therapy. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment option  The prevalence of cardiac sarcoidosis has exponentially increased over the past decade, primarily due to increased awareness and diagnostic modalities for the disease entity. Despite an expanding patient cohort, the optimal management of cardiac sarcoidosis remains yet to be established with a significant lack of prospective trials to support current practice. Corticosteroids remain first-line treatment of this disorder, Prednisone is used as first-line therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids are still the first-line treatment, but alternative therapy with anti-TNF agents, like pentoxifylline, thalidomide and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies become more interesting, especially in refractory sarcoidosis.<br> Corticosteroids are still the first-line treatment, but alternative therapy with anti-TNF agents, like pentoxifylline, thalidomide and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies become more interesting, especially in refractory sarcoidosis. While corticosteroids remain the first line of treatment, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors have been investigated as one potential steroid sparing treatment for sarcoidosis. Systemic corticosteroids are the first line treatment in sarcoidosis. Although glucocorticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment in sarcoidosis, refractory cases require alternatives, such as methotrexate (MTX). Corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for sarcoidosis as many patients never require treatment or only necessitate a short treatment duration. Corticosteroids are still the first-line treatment, but alternative therapy with anti-TNF agents, like pentoxifylline, thalidomide and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies become more interesting, especially in refractory sarcoidosis.. Glucocorticoid treatment is first-line therapy for hepatic sarcoidosis, improving symptoms and abnormal laboratory values but generally having no effect on progression of disease. Steroids remain the first-choice therapeutic in sarcoidosis; however, long-term use is associated with toxicity. Glucocorticoids are the first-line therapy for sarcoidosis.  Oral glucocorticoids are the standard first-line treatment for sarcoidosis.  Corticosteroids are used as first-line treatment in organ-threatening sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids still remain first-line therapy in sarcoidosis.  Generally, oral corticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment for symptomatic patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.

5a68f005b750ff4455000016	Which personality disorder is treated using dialectical behavior therapy?	Neural correlates of distraction in borderline personality disorder before and after dialectical behavior therapy. It is unknown whether neural correlates of emotion regulation change after a psychotherapy which has the goal to improve emotion dysregulation in BPD, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).  In conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after DBT in patients with BPD. ObjectiveInvestigate influence and change of self-directedness (SD) in Dialectical-Behavior Therapy (DBT) for 26 female outpatients with borderline personality disorder (BPS). ConclusionDBT strengthens the SD of patients with BPD. OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment with efficacy in reducing self-harm behaviors in borderline personality disorder (BPD).  CONCLUSION: This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training. Exploring the effectiveness of combined mentalization-based group therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy for inpatients with borderline personality disorder - A pilot study. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation, whereby problems concerning social cognition, which are also characteristic of BPD, may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT). Pain-mediated affect regulation is reduced after dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a longitudinal fMRI study. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an emotion-regulating effect. We investigated whether pain-mediated affect regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation techniques.  Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency. Of evaluated psychological treatments in borderline personality disorder, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the strongest research support, followed by mentalization based therapy (MBT). The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed by Marsha Linehan (1991) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but because of the core deficits in emotion regulation in disruptive behavior disorders, DBT is also increasingly being recommended for the treatment of CD and APD. Treatment of suicidal and deliberate self-harming patients with borderline personality disorder using dialectical behavioral therapy: the patients' and the therapists' perceptions. Dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy also caused a soaring remission rate of diagnostic borderline personality disorder criteria of 57% and 94%, respectively. OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for outpatients with borderline personality disorder. OBJECTIVE The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that dialectical behavior therapy is a promising psychosocial intervention for improving interpersonal functioning among severely dysfunctional patients with borderline personality disorder. A central component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the teaching of specific behavioral skills with the aim of helping individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) replace maladaptive behaviors with skillful behavior. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally designed as a treatment of emotionally dysregulated, impulsive, and dramatic disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder) and populations (e.g., parasuicidal women). Dialectical behavior therapy, an outpatient psychosocial treatment for chronically suicidal women with borderline personality disorder, has been adapted for use in a partial hospital program for women. OBJECTIVE At present, the most frequently investigated psychosocial intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients. Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency. These results suggest that individuals with borderline personality disorder benefited equally from dialectical behavior therapy and a well-specified treatment delivered by psychiatrists with expertise in the treatment of borderline personality disorder..

5a79d0b8faa1ab7d2e00000d	What cellular process are okazaki fragments associated with?	This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases α and δ carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively.  At DNA replication forks, the overall growth of the antiparallel two daughter DNA chains appears to occur 5'-to-3' direction in the leading-strand and 3'-to-5' direction in the lagging-strand using enzyme system only able to elongate 5'-to-3' direction, and I describe in this review how we have analyzed and proved the lagging strand multistep synthesis reactions, called Discontinuous Replication Mechanism, which involve short RNA primer synthesis, primer-dependent short DNA chains (Okazaki fragments) synthesis, primer removal from the Okazaki fragments and gap filling between Okazaki fragments by RNase H and DNA polymerase I, and long lagging strand formation by joining between Okazaki fragments with DNA ligase. Therefore, efficient processing of Okazaki fragments is vital for DNA replication and cell proliferation. RNA primer removal from Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand replication and the excision of damaged DNA bases requires the action of structure-specific nucleases, such as the mammalian flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1). Lagging strand DNA replication requires the concerted actions of DNA polymerase δ, Fen1 and DNA ligase I for the removal of the RNA/DNA primers before ligation of Okazaki fragments. Processing of Okazaki fragments to complete lagging strand DNA synthesis requires coordination among several proteins. During DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, short single-stranded DNA segments known as Okazaki fragments are first synthesized on the lagging strand. During DNA replication, repetitive synthesis of discrete Okazaki fragments requires mechanisms that guarantee DNA polymerase, clamp, and primase proteins are present for every cycle. DNA replication is a primary mechanism for maintaining genome integrity, but it serves this purpose best by cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. Unlike leading strand synthesis, lagging strand synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp FENs (flap endonucleases) play essential roles in DNA replication, pivotally in the resolution of Okazaki fragments.  Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) has been shown to remove 5' overhanging flap intermediates during base excision repair and to process the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA replication in vitro. Frequent priming of the discontinuous strand results in the formation of many small segments, designated Okazaki fragments. These short pieces need to be processed and joined to form an intact DNA strand During DNA replication, synthesis of the lagging strand occurs in stretches termed Okazaki fragments.  Fifty per cent of the genome is discontinuously replicated on the lagging strand as Okazaki fragments.  During replication, Okazaki fragment maturation is a fundamental process that joins discontinuously synthesized DNA fragments into a contiguous lagging strand. Even though synthesis and joining of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing these fragments is about twice that needed for leading strand synthesis.  Okazaki fragments that are intermediates during DNA replication. Deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments generates a comprehensive, genomic map of DNA synthesis, starting from a single asynchronous culture. Essentially all of the Okazaki fragments on replicating Simian virus 40 (SV40)DNA could be grouped into one of three classes Genome-wide Okazaki fragment distribution can differentiate the discontinuous from the semi-discontinuous DNA replication model. We uncover a dual regulatory role for chromatin during DNA replication: promoting origin dependence and determining Okazaki fragment length by restricting Pol δ progression.	['DNA replication']
5a68f965b750ff445500001a	Clue cells are characteristics to which causative bacteria of vaginitis?	Most of these 290 smears contained clue cells (indicating Gardnerella infection) and a lack of lactobacilli.  As part of the routine screening process, all smears were screened for the overgrowth of Gardnerella (i.e. smears with an abundance of clue cells) and for the presence of Trichomonas and Candida. Positive criteria for a Gram stain included greater than 10 white blood cells per high-power field, gram-negative intracellular/extracellular diplococci (suggesting N gonorrhoeae), clue cells (suggesting T vaginalis), or direct visualization of T vaginalis organisms.  he appraised infectious agents were Coccobacilli, Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis, and clue cells (Gardnerella vaginalis). Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis, affecting over 3 million women in the United States annually. Depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. To date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. Differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (Amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) pH greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells.  Although the presence of clue cells and amine-like odor in KOH test have relationship with Gardnerella vaginalis, these tests could also suggest the presence of these mycoplasmas.

5a6900ebb750ff445500001d	Which disease is diagnosed using the Finkelstein's test?	The inclusion criteria were positive Finkelstein's test and no response to non-surgical treatment for 6 weeks. Forty-eight patients with de Quervain's disease who did not respond to conservative treatment were operated with two different incisions. De Quervain's disease has different clinical features. Different tests have been described in the past, the most popular test being the Eichhoff's test, often wrongly named as the Finkelstein's test. Furthermore, we found that Finkelstein's test can give a false positive result. Therefore, ultrasound should not only be considered to improve the treatment outcome, but can also be useful as a diagnostic tool in the management of de Quervain's disease. The Finkelstein's test was positive in all cases.  A successful outcome was achieved in all cases with negative Finkelstein's test. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment.

5a6e1280b750ff4455000037	For which type of cancer can uc.189 be used as a potential prognostic biomarker?	Upregulation of uc.189 in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinicopathologic value. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients. Uc.189 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which provides a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

5a87145861bb38fb24000004	What causes Black Lung?	A prospective case-control study was undertaken to assess respiratory disability in 133 former coal miners who were claimants for "black lung" benefits. Consecutive assignment was made to either case or control group based on their chest radiograph having shown coal workers' pneumoconiosis or no coal workers' pneumoconiosis. It has recently been suggested that the inhalation of coal in the absence of complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) or smoking can lead to disabling airways obstruction Highlights in the history of efforts to prevent occupational lung disease among coal miners in the United States are reviewed. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 is summarized, and the sources and effects of its provisions to prevent coal workers' pneumoconiosis are examined. Descriptions follow of the identification of coal workers' pneumoconiosis as a disease, identification of respirable coal mine dust as its cause, and establishment and enforcement of an exposure limit Coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a preventable occupational disorder of the respiratory system resulting from exposure to and retention of respirable coal dust.

5a6f853ab750ff4455000055	Which disease can be diagnosed with the "probe to bone" test?	Clinical inflammatory signs, probe-to-bone test, and plain X-rays are postulated as the basic tests for clinical diagnosis when DFO is suspected.  In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected.  Diagnostic Accuracy of Probe to Bone to Detect Osteomyelitis in the Diabetic Foot: A Systematic Review. The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is a commonly used clinical test for osteomyelitis (OM), but its utility has been questioned in clinical settings where the prevalence of OM is low. This article aims to systematically review the accuracy of the PTB test to diagnose diabetic foot OM. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the PTB test was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], .75-.93) and 0.83 (95% CI, .65-.93), respectively. We conclude that the PTB test can accurately rule in diabetic foot OM in the high-risk patients and rule out OM in low-risk patients. Inter-observer reproducibility of diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis based on a combination of probe-to-bone test and simple radiography. Probe-to-bone test and simple X-rays are both standard tests for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. This study demonstrates the importance of considering jointly clinical information (probe-to-bone test) and diagnostic tests (simple radiography) to increase agreement among clinicians on diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity and specificity (90% and 79%) than plain radiography (54% and 68%) for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis. MRI performs somewhat better than any of several common tests--probe to bone (PTB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)>70 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP)>14 mg/L, procalcitonin>0.3 ng/mL, and ulcer size>2 cm²--although PTB has the highest specificity of any test and is commonly used together with MRI. AIMS: To investigate the accuracy of the sequential combination of the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the foot of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture. The performance characteristics of both the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays were excellent.  CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive. The tests assessed were probe-to-bone (PTB), clinical signs of infection, radiography signs of osteomyelitis, and ulcer specimen culture.<br><b>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</b>: A prospective study was performed on patients with foot ulcers referred to our diabetic foot clinic.

Diagnostic Accuracy of Probe to Bone to Detect Osteomyelitis in the Diabetic Foot: OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the accuracy of the probe-to-bone (PTB) test in diagnosing foot osteomyelitis in a cohort of diabetic patients with bone culture proven disease. Validating the probe-to-bone test and other tests for diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2, a positive probe-to-bone test result, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h, and an abnormal plain radiograph result are helpful in diagnosing the presence of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is a commonly used clinical test for osteomyelitis (OM), but its utility has been questioned in clinical settings where the prevalence of OM is low.

5a679e8cb750ff4455000006	Milwaukee protocol was tested for treatment of which disease?	Caring for a patient with rabies: implications of the Milwaukee protocol for infection control and public health measures. The Milwaukee protocol, which to date has five reported human rabies survivors associated with its use, has been suggested as a potential management pathway for human rabies.  Critical Appraisal of the Milwaukee Protocol for Rabies: This Failed Approach Should Be Abandoned. Therapies suggested in the Milwaukee protocol include therapeutic coma, ketamine infusion, amantadine, and the screening/prophylaxis/management of cerebral vasospasm. None of these therapies can be substantiated in rabies or other forms of acute viral encephalitis. The Milwaukee protocol has been attributed to survival in rabies encephalitis despite a lack of scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic measures.  Rabies is virtually always fatal after clinical disease develops, and there have only been rare survivors. The Milwaukee protocol, which includes therapeutic coma, has been shown to be ineffective and should no longer be used. The Milwaukee Protocol has proved to be ineffective for rabies and should no longer be used.

5a76179d83b0d9ea66000021	Which algorithm has been proposed for efficient storage of WGS variant calls?	SeqArray-a storage-efficient high-performance data format for WGS variant calls. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are being generated at an unprecedented rate. Analysis of WGS data requires a flexible data format to store the different types of DNA variation. Variant call format (VCF) is a general text-based format developed to store variant genotypes and their annotations. However, VCF files are large and data retrieval is relatively slow. Here we introduce a new WGS variant data format implemented in the R/Bioconductor package 'SeqArray' for storing variant calls in an array-oriented manner which provides the same capabilities as VCF, but with multiple high compression options and data access using high-performance parallel computing.Results: Benchmarks using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data show file sizes are 14.0 Gb (VCF), 12.3 Gb (BCF, binary VCF), 3.5 Gb (BGT) and 2.6 Gb (SeqArray) respectively. Reading genotypes in the SeqArray package are two to three times faster compared with the htslib C library using BCF files. For the allele frequency calculation, the implementation in the SeqArray package is over 5 times faster than PLINK v1.9 with VCF and BCF files, and over 16 times faster than vcftools.

5a774fdcfaa1ab7d2e000008	Which protein is regulated by Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR)?	The p53-binding protein 1-Tudor-interacting repair regulator complex participates in the DNA damage response. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1. TIRR regulates 53BP1 by masking its histone methyl-lysine binding function. P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.

5a804f71faa1ab7d2e00001d	Which algorithm is used for detection of long repeat expansions?	Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.

An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.

5a8056a2faa1ab7d2e00001f	Which web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes has been developed?	iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10 years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.

5a9700adfcd1d6a10c00002c	Sclerostin regulates what process?	 Sclerostin is a soluble antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling secreted primarily by osteocytes. Current evidence indicates that sclerostin likely functions as a local/paracrine regulator of bone metabolism rather than as an endocrine hormone.  After discovering that lack of Sost/sclerostin expression is the cause of the high bone mass human syndromes Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis, extensive animal experimentation and clinical studies demonstrated that sclerostin plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and that its deficiency or pharmacological neutralization increases bone formation Sclerostin is a locally acting regulator of late-osteoblast/preosteocyte differentiation and regulates mineralization through a MEPE-ASARM-dependent mechanism. The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. Sclerostin is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of bone mass. Sclerostin secreted by osteocytes is mechanosensory and important in bone remodeling. Sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt signaling pathway and also has an important role in postmenopausal bone loss. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt pathway signaling. Sclerostin, an osteocyte-expressed negative regulator of bone formation, is one of the inhibitors of Wnt signaling that is a critical pathway in the correct process of osteoblast differentiation. Sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein, regulates osteoblast function. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt signaling pathway and also has an important role in postmenopausal bone loss. Since sclerostin expression is confined to the bone-resorbing osteoclast, it provides a mechanism whereby bone apposition is inhibited in the vicinity of resorption. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Sclerostin regulates release of bone mineral by osteocytes by induction of carbonic anhydrase 2. The secreted glycoprotein, sclerostin alters bone formation. Sclerostin, encoded by the sost gene, and a product of the osteocyte, is a negative regulator of bone formation.  Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity and bone turnover, and it plays a role in cardiovascular calcification processes.   Sclerostin plays a major role in regulating skeletal bone mass, but its effects in articular cartilage are not known. Sclerostin is a key negative regulator of bone formation Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation In humans, the SOST gene encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone growth and remodeling, which also negatively regulates the bone repair process.

5aa50086d6d6b54f7900000c	Which is the function of ubiquilins?	Ubiquilin (UBQLN) proteins are adaptors thought to link ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Ubiquilins are proteins that function as ubiquitin receptors in eukaryotes. Mutations in two ubiquilin-encoding genes have been linked to the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, ubiquilin functions are still poorly understood. Ubiquitination and subsequently ubiquitin (Ub) receptor proteins (e.g., p62 and ubiquilins) are important common factors for targeting misfolded proteins to multiple quality control destinies, including the proteasome, lysosomes, and perhaps aggresomes, as well as for triggering mitophagy to remove defective mitochondria.  We show that Ubiquilin family proteins bind transmembrane domains in the cytosol to prevent aggregation and temporarily allow opportunities for membrane targeting. Over time, Ubiquilins recruit an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate bound clients. The attached ubiquitin engages Ubiquilin's UBA domain, normally bound to an intramolecular UBL domain, and stabilizes the Ubiquilin-client complex. Ubiquilins (Ubqlns) are a family of ubiquitin receptors that promote the delivery of hydrophobic and aggregated ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation.   Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways. Ubiquilins (UBQLN), a family of adaptor proteins with partial homology with ubiquitin, are proposed to facilitate proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated substrates	['Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways.']

Carriage prevalence of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in gallbladders of adult autopsy cases from Mozambique. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of S. Typhi in gallbladders among adult autopsy cases from Mozambique. Salmonella Extracellular Matrix Components Influence Biofilm Formation and Gallbladder Colonization. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever in humans, forms biofilms encapsulated by an extracellular matrix (ECM). Biofilms facilitate colonization and persistent infection in gallbladders of humans and mouse models of chronic carriage. In vitro modeling of gallbladder-associated Salmonella spp. colonization. The host-pathogen interactions occurring in the gallbladder during Salmonella Typhi colonization contribute to typhoid fever pathogenesis during the acute and chronic stages of disease. The gallbladder is the primary reservoir during chronic typhoid carriage. Salmonella chronic carriage: epidemiology, diagnosis, and gallbladder persistence. Gallbladder carriage has been demonstrated to be mediated by biofilm formation on gallstones and by intracellular persistence in the gallbladder epithelium of mice.  Gallbladder epithelium as a niche for chronic Salmonella carriage. This chronic state is highly associated with the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder of infected carriers upon which Salmonella can form robust biofilms. However, we hypothesize that in addition to gallstones, the gallbladder epithelium aids in the establishment/maintenance of chronic carriage.

Oral fexinidazole for late-stage African Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis: a pivotal multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients. AIM: Fexinidazole (FEX) is a nitroimidazole being developed as a new trypanocide treatment for human African trypanosomiasis/sleeping sickness.  We also observed that fexinidazole and fexinidazole sulfone are more effective than benznidazole and nifurtimox as curative treatments, particularly for acute stage infections, most likely as a result of the higher and more prolonged exposure of the sulfone derivative. Specifically, the authors review the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole, which is one of the few drugs which have reached Phase II trials.  New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles.  Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in treating T. cruzi in a mouse model of acute infection, with cure rates superior to those achieved with either fexinidazole itself or benznidazole. Fexinidazole treatment was also shown to reduce myocarditis in all animals infected with VL-10 or Colombian resistant T. cruzi strains, although parasite eradication was not achieved in all treated animals at the tested doses.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Fexinidazole is an effective oral treatment of acute and chronic experimental CD caused by benznidazole-susceptible, partially resistant, and resistant T. cruzi. Fexinidazole is moderately active in vitro against African trypanosomes (IC₅₀ against laboratory strains and recent clinical isolates ranged between 0.16 and 0.93 µg/mL) and oral administration of fexinidazole at doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days or 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days cured mice with acute and chronic infection respectively, the latter being a model for the advanced and fatal stage of the disease when parasites have disseminated into the brain.

Determination of an optimal dosing regimen for fexinidazole, a novel oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis: first-in-human studies. Here, we report that fexinidazole, a drug currently in phase 1 clinical trials for treating African trypanosomiasis, shows promise for treating visceral leishmaniasis. CONCLUSIONS Fexinidazole is an effective oral treatment of acute and chronic experimental CD caused by benznidazole-susceptible, partially resistant, and resistant T. cruzi. Fexinidazole, a 2-subsituted 5-nitroimidazole drug candidate rediscovered following extensive compound mining by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and currently in Phase I clinical study for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis, was evaluated in experimental models of acute and chronic CD caused by different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT. INTERPRETATION Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients. Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole drug currently in clinical development for the treatment of human sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis [HAT]), caused by infection with species of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. In the search for new therapeutics, the repurposing of the broad-spectrum antiprotozoal drug fexinidazole has completed Phase III trials with the anticipation that it will be the first oral treatment for HAT. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole recently included in a clinical efficacy trial as an oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Fexinidazole, a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining of public and pharmaceutical company databases, has the potential to become a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment, curing both acute and chronic HAT.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus houses the central circadian clock and is characterized by the timely regulated expression of clock genes. Clock genes control circadian rhythms both centrally, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain and peripherally, within every organ of the body. The mammalian circadian system consists of a central oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which coordinates peripheral clocks in organs throughout the body. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied,   In mammals, a master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, adjusts timing of other self-sustained oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs. Circadian clocks are endogenous and biological oscillations that occur with a period of<24 h. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is linked to peripheral tissues through neural and hormonal signals.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls circadian rhythms in mammals The environmental light-dark (LD) cycle entrains the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mammals. Although circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior are dependent upon a biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the molecular mechanism of this clock is in fact cell autonomous and conserved in nearly all cells of the body. The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a central pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsidiary oscillators in nearly all body cells. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain is the circadian center, relaying rhythmic environmental and behavioral information to peripheral tissues to control circadian physiology.

A hallmark of heart failure (HF) is adverse extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which is regulated by the collagen cross-linking enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX). Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is an extracellular matrix (ECM)-modifying enzyme that has been involved in cardiovascular remodeling. Lysyl oxidases (LOX) are copper-dependent enzymes that oxidize primary amine substrates to reactive aldehydes. The best-studied role of LOX enzymes is the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in animals by cross-linking collagens and elastin, although intracellular functions have been reported as well.  LOXL2 is proposed to function similarly to LOX in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by promoting crosslinking of collagen and elastin.

5ace17c30340b9f058000009	Which olfactory gene senses androsterone?	any mammals can decipher these scent codes to discern the gender, age, endocrine status, social status, and genotype of conspecifics using dedicated sensory receptors in their olfactory system. A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor OR7D4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene (P = 1.1 × 10(-4)).  These findings suggest that 1) the perceived intensity of some but not all odorants is a heritable trait, 2) use of a current genome-wide marker panel did not detect a known olfactory genotype-phenotype association, and 3) person-to-person differences in androstenone perception are influenced by OR7D4 genotype and perhaps by variants of other genes. The flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene (OR7D4) and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1D). A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor OR7D4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene (P = 1.1 × 10(-4)).	['OR7D4']

5ace19420340b9f05800000a	Which gene is responsible for red hair?	Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response. In humans, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1 receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than skin type.  Red hair in man is due to certain loss of function mutations of one of the peptide products of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R, MIM 155555) This paper reviews the path of discovery of the MC1R in control of animal coat colour, the subsequent role of MC1R in human physiology and possibly wider role of MC1R in human skin carcinogenesis and human development through history. Melanocortin-1 receptor gene variants determine the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer independently of fair skin and red hair. A strong association between MC1R gene variants and fair skin and red hair was established, especially the variants Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp (P<.0001).  Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene variants are associated with fair skin and red hair Sequence polymorphism in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene as an indicator of the red hair phenotype. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype We report the frequencies of MC1R variants in the British red haired population. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R): more than just red hair.  Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour.  The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Altered cell surface expression of human MC1R variant receptor alleles associated with red hair and skin cancer risk. The human melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) encodes a G-protein coupled receptor that is primarily expressed on melanocytes, where it plays a key role in pigmentation regulation. Variant alleles are associated with red hair colour and fair skin, known as the RHC phenotype, as well as skin cancer risk. Red hair is the null phenotype of MC1R. The MC1R gene has many polymorphisms, some of which have been linked to variation in pigmentation phenotypes within human populations.  The association signals at the MC1R gene locus from CDH were uniformly more significant than traditional GWA analyses (the most significant P for CDH = 3.11×10⁻¹⁴² vs. P for rs258322 = 1.33×10⁻⁶⁶). The CDH test will contribute towards finding rare LOF variants in GWAS and sequencing studies. The MC1R gene plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis. Loss-of-function MC1R variants, which impair protein function, are associated with red hair color (RHC) phenotype and increased skin cancer risk. Genetic analysis of melanocortin 1 receptor red hair color variants in a Russian population of Eastern Siberia. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. In humans, loss-of-function MC1R mutations cause fair skin, freckling, red hair, and increased predisposition to melanoma; in mice, Mc1r loss-of-function is responsible for the recessive yellow mutation, associated with pheomelanic hair and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. The Melanocortin-1 Receptor (MC1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor, which is responsible for production of the darker eumelanin pigment and the tanning response. We show that a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which contains Mc1r will efficiently rescue loss of Mc1r in transgenic mice, and that overexpression of the receptor suppresses the effect of the endogenous antagonist, agouti protein. Pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene on human pigmentation. Variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene are common in individuals with red hair and fair skin, but the relative contribution to these pigmentary traits in heterozygotes, homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for variants at this locus from the multiple alleles present in Caucasian populations is unclear. A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. BACKGROUND Red hair color is caused by variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. Red hair individuals are usually compound heterozygotes or homozygous for one of a number of MC1R polymorphisms associated with red hair. Variants of the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) gene have been found to be associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype. The genetic basis for red hair involves specific mutations, red hair color (RHC) alleles, in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. In humans, loss-of-function MC1R mutations cause fair skin, freckling, red hair, and increased predisposition to melanoma; in mice, Mc1r loss-of-function is responsible for the recessive yellow mutation, associated with pheomelanic hair and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. A multiplex PCR and a multiplex single base extension protocol were established for genotyping six exonic MC1R variations highly penetrant for red hair (R), four exonic MC1R variations weakly penetrant for red hair (r), two frameshift variations highly penetrant for red hair (R) and three variations in the promoter region. We have investigated 174 individuals from 11 large kindreds with a preponderance of red hair and an additional 99 unrelated redheads, for MC1R variants and have confirmed that red hair is usually inherited as a recessive characteristic with the R151C, R160W, D294H, R142H, 86insA and 537insC alleles at this locus. Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) are two major genes affecting coat color phenotypes in mammals, and inactivation mutations in the MC1R gene are responsible for red coat color in European pig breeds. No loss-of-function mutation in MC1R responsible for red coat color in European breeds was observed in this breed. The genetic basis for red hair involves specific mutations, red hair color (RHC) alleles, in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. In conclusion, no functional variant responsible for brownish red coloration was found in the coding region of MC1R and ASIP in Tibetan pigs.. Red hair color is caused by variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene.	['Melanocortin 1 receptor', 'MC1R']

5ace37d50340b9f058000011	Which is the main reason for the increase in the incidence of cryptococcal disease?	The incidence of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans has increased four-fold in the last decade. It is an increasing cause of infection in immunosuppressed patients, most notably those with HIV infection. Currently, 4.0% patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom are known to have developed cryptococcosis. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Cryptococcal disease is an opportunistic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in adults with HIV. Primary prophylaxis with antifungal interventions may decrease cryptococcal disease incidence and associated mortality.<br><b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To assess the efficacy of antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV.<br><b>SEARCH STRATEGY</b>: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on the Health Sciences (LILACS), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). When the two studies using fluconazole as the intervention were analyzed together (N=518), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking fluconazole for primary prophylaxis (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07, 0.87) compared to those taking placebo; however, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14, 2.62).<br><b>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS</b>: Antifungal primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease.

AIDS is the main predisposing condition for cryptococcal meningitis, and thus the profile of most patients mirrors that of HIV infection. We reviewed abstracts from the following relevant conferences: International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Antifungal primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease. BACKGROUND Cryptococcal meningitis is a common opportunistic infection in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased in parallel with that of HIV infection. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus spp., is the most common form of meningitis and a leading cause of death among persons with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors observed no differences in the radiographic appearances of pulmonary cryptococcal disease between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and other immunocompromised individuals. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased in parallel with that of HIV infection. Despite advances in the treatment of HIV disease, the incidence and mortality of invasive cryptococcal disease remain significant.	['HIV infection', 'HIV']
5a8980d2fcd1d6a10c00000d	Which is the main protein in brown adipose tissue (BAT) active in thermogenesis?	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria are distinct from their counterparts in other tissues in that ATP production is not their primary physiologic role. BAT mitochondria are equipped with a specialized protein known as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). UCP1 short-circuits the electron transport chain, allowing mitochondrial membrane potential to be transduced to heat, making BAT a tissue capable of altering energy expenditure and fuel metabolism in mammals without increasing physical activity. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is the hallmark protein responsible for cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism essential for survival and normal physiological functions in mammals. Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) (i.e.uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-based) UCP1's central role in non-shivering thermogenesis is acknowledged JAK2 promotes brown adipose tissue function and is required for diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis in mice.

5aafc37afcf4565872000010	What is the function of HDAC  proteins?	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription.  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms Accumulating evidence has implicated histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation in diverse embryonic and adult tissues. The function of eukaryotic histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been extensively studied for its critical role in transcriptional regulation and carcinogenesis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression that require assembly into larger protein complexes for activity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDAC is a family of enzymes involved in deacetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. Gene expression is in part controlled by chromatin remodeling factors and the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. The latter process is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to remove acetyl groups from histone tails. This liberates positive charges on the histone tail and allows for tighter winding of DNA, preventing transcription factor binding and gene activation Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases catalyze the reversible acetylation of histones and nonhistone substrates to control the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of normal and tumor cells Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify core histones and participate in large regulatory complexes that both suppress and enhance transcription Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins. The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones.

5a885add61bb38fb24000017	What is the H4S47C cleavage mapping method used for?	To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase.  To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome.  To map fission yeast centromeres, we applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping and native and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation with paired-end sequencing. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. H3 nucleosomes are nearly absent from the central domain, which is occupied by centromere-specific H3 (cenH3 or CENP-A) nucleosomes with two H4s per particle that are mostly unpositioned and are more widely spaced than nucleosomes elsewhere. To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes.

5ac725250340b9f058000006	Which miRNA is associated with the circular RNA ciRS-7?	In addition, according to recent studies, circular RNA-7 (ciRS-7) acts as a sponge of miR-7 and thus inhibits its activity. Numerous evidences have confirmed expression of miR-7 is dysregulated in cancer tissues, however, whether ciRS-7 invovled in oncogenesis by acting as sponge of miR-7 remains unclear. Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues.  This review summarizes the structure and function of circRNAs and provides evidence for the impact of ciRS-7 in promoting the development of cancer by acting as sponge of miR-7.	['miR-7']

5ace238e0340b9f05800000d	Which human chromosome is the product of fusion?	The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin.  It is known that human chromosome 2 originated from the fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes.  Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion. We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2. Human chromosome 2 is a product of a telomere fusion of two ancestral chromosomes and loss/degeneration of one of the two original centromeres. We investigate the most recent product of a chromosome fusion event fixed in the human lineage, human chromosome 2, whose stability was acquired by the suppression of one centromere, resulting in a unique difference in chromosome number between humans (46 chromosomes) and our most closely related ape relatives (48 chromosomes). Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. By doing so, one is able to provide evidence for the presence of both active and degenerate centromeric satellite profiles on chromosome 2 in these archaic genomes, supporting the hypothesis that the chromosomal fusion event took place prior to our last common ancestor with Denisovan and Neandertal hominins and presenting a genomic reference for predicting karyotype in ancient genomic datasets.<br> Centromere Destiny in Dicentric Chromosomes: New Insights from the Evolution of Human Chromosome 2 Ancestral Centromeric Region. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Our results suggest two possible centromere inactivation models to explain the evolutionarily stabilization of human chromosome 2 over the last 5-6 million years.	['chromosome 2', '2']
5abbe429fcf456587200001c	What is the drug target for Eliquis (Apixaban)?	The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) include dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®), a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Apixaban (Eliquis) and Edoxaban (Lixiana®), which are direct anti-Xa inhibitors The new direct oral anticoagulants directly targeting thrombin (factor IIa) or factor-Xa, are currently used for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (rivaroxaban, Xarelto) or for the prevention of systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (rivaroxaban; dabigatran, Pradaxa; Apixaban, Eliquis). Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical practice. The direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban (Eliquis(®)) has predictable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and does not require routine anticoagulation monitoring. The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) include dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®), a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Apixaban (Eliquis) and Edoxaban (Lixiana®), which are direct anti-Xa inhibitors. BACKGROUND: apixaban (BMS-562247) (Eliquis(®)) is a novel, orally active, selective, direct, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa). They include the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim) and the oral direct FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Bayer HealthCare), apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb), and edoxaban (Lixiana/Savaysa, Daiichi-Sankyo). Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical practice. Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Apixaban (Eliquis™), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer as a therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of thrombotic disorders. These specific substances directly block either thrombin (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) or Factor Xa (e.g., apixaban). Due to the high protein binding the direkt FXa-inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®) can not be hemodialysed. Apixaban (Eliquis®) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).	['factor Xa']

5ab90a79fcf456587200001b	What drug treatment can cause a spinal epidural hematoma?	Spinal epidural hematomas are rare entity in neurosurgery practice. Most of them are spontaneous due to anticoagulant therapy and called spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas (SSEHs). Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare disease that causes cord compression and neurologic deficit. Spontaneous SEH is related to minor trauma, bleeding disorders, and anticoagulant medications. Chronic Spinal Subdural Hematoma Associated with Antiplatelet Therapy. pinal subdural hematoma associated with antiplatelet therapy The authors report a case of acute spinal epidural hematoma occurring in a patient receiving antiplatelet drugs.  Spontaneous epidural hematoma of the spine (SEHS) is an extremely rare entity. Patients known to have thrombophilia or on anticoagulant drugs are the most affected Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail. In up to a third of cases (29.7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding. Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories. Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage. We report the case of a man of 65 who, at 20 and 37 days from surgery of C6 corpectomy, experienced two epidural hematomas at C7-D1. We assume that the pathogenic cause of this rare disease was an overlap between three main factors: the surgical aggression of the internal anterior epidural venous plexus; a possible increase of intra-thoracic pressure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and double antiplatelet drug therapy.

5a86e6fafaa1ab7d2e000036	What is the nucleotide composition of the Lamin Associated Domains (LADs)?	Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence. In metazoans, the nuclear lamina is thought to play an important role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment.

5ad4dd93133db5eb78000008	What is the clathrin triskelia structure?	Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains (CLCs). A principal component in the protein coats of certain post-golgi and endocytic vesicles is clathrin, which appears as a three-legged heteropolymer (known as a triskelion) that assembles into polyhedral cages principally made up of pentagonal and hexagonal faces.  The clathrin triskelion, which is a three-legged pinwheel-shaped heteropolymer, is a major component in the protein coats of certain post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles.

5ace1a590340b9f05800000b	What percentage of Homo sapiens DNA is of Neanderthal origin?	We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Here, we present evidence of Neanderthal introgression within the chromosome 3p21.31 region, occurring with a high frequency in East Asians (ranging from 49.4% to 66.5%) and at a low frequency in Europeans. This introgression was under positive natural selection, reached a frequency of>50%, and introduced a homocysteine level- and pigmentation-associated allele (rs460879-T) into East Asians.  Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans.  This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. 	['2-4%']
5ac0a36f19833b0d7b000002	What is an exosome?	Exosomes are small extracellular membrane-based vesicles with a variety of cargoes that are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system.  Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that have important roles in intercellular communication. They contain and carry bioactive molecules within their membranes which are delivered to target cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and can be found in cell culture supernatants and biofluids. EVs carry proteins, nucleic acids, and other cellular components and can deliver these to nearby or distant cells, making EVs of interest as both disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets Exosomes are released by cells as self-contained vesicles with an intact lipid bilayer that encapsulates a small portion of the parent cell. Exosomes are a type of cell-derived extracellular nanovesicle. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released to the extracellular milieu through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are natural products released from many sources and play a role in antigen presentation, immunoregulation, and signal transduction.  Exosomes, cell-derived vesicles encompassing lipids, DNA, proteins coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are present in diverse body fluids. Exosomes are 60-80 nm vesicles of endocytic origin. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles, secreted by most cell types from multivesicular endosomes, and thought to play important roles in intercellular communications. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles first described as such 30 years ago and since implicated in cell-cell communication and the transmission of disease states, and explored as a means of drug discovery. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released upon fusion of multivesicular bodies(MVBs) with the cellular plasma membrane. Exosomes are small vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm that are produced by many, if not all, cell types. The exosome, a molecular machine for controlled RNA degradation in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Exosomes are part of the endocytic system,which is tightly regulated and able to respond to several stimuli that lead to alterations in the composition of its sub-compartments. Exosomes were shown to contain selectively sorted functional proteins, lipids, and RNAs, mediating cell-to-cell communications and hence playing a role in the physiology of the healthy and diseased organism. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles of endocytic origin released into the extracellular space upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted by a multitude of cell types as a consequence of fusion of multivesicular late endosomes/lysosomes with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by the vast majority of cell types both in vivo and ex vivo, upon the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the cellular plasma membrane. An exosome (30-150 nm size) is a cell-derived vesicle. Exosomes are a subtype of vesicles released by cells of both healthy and neoplastic origin. PURPOSE: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100nm in diameter) secreted by cells into extracellul Exosome is a mechanism of intercellular drug transfer: Application of quantitative pharmacology. Exosomes are the newest family member of 'bioactive vesicles' that function to promote intercellular communication. Exosomes are nanosized membrane vesicles released by fusion of an organelle of the endocytic pathway, the multivesicular body, with the plasma membrane. Exosomes are nano-sized membrane vesicles (50-120 nm), which are released from a wide variety of cells. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by many cell types in both normal and pathogenic circumstances. Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from late endosomal compartments and secreted by most living cells in ex vivo cell culture conditions. Exosomes are nanosized membrane particles that are secreted by cells that transmit information from cell to cell. he exosome is a promising biomarker carrying many kinds of membrane proteins with huge heterogeneity, so the sensitive and multiplex analysis of exosomes is very significant for diseas The RNA exosome is an evolutionarily conserved 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic protein complex involved in processing and degradation of different classes of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs, and, therefore, important for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression.

5ac3699f0340b9f058000001	Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?	 Recent comparative studies have begun to investigate the evolution of the sequence architecture within enhancers. A detailed analysis of the fast-evolving sparkling enhancer in Drosophila now identifies key compensatory mechanisms and 'grammar' elements that are critical for maintaining functional integrity. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located We summarize recent case studies and genome-wide investigations that have uncovered diverse mechanisms though which new enhancers arise We report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes.  Our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences.

5aac543bfcf4565872000004	What biologic process in the body is associated with Mast cells?	Mast cells (MCs) may play an important role in plaque destabilization and atherosclerotic coronary complications. Mast cells are significantly involved in IgE-mediated allergic reactions  Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa Mast cells and basophils are innate immune cells with overlapping functions that contribute to anti-helminth immunity.  Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body, predominantly near blood vessels and nerves, and express effector functions in allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, and host defense. The mast cell is the cellular basis for immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells are important elements of the body response to foreign antigens, being those represented either by small molecules (allergic response) or harbored by foreign microorganisms (response to parasite infection). Mast cells are ubiquitous in the body and multifunctional immune cells; they are known to be primary responders in allergic reactions, orchestrating strong responses to minute amounts of allergens. In IgE-associated biological responses, the crosslinking of Fc&#949;RI-bound IgE with multivalent antigens initiate the activation of mast cells by promoting aggregation of FceRI. Mast cell activation has been shown to be an initiator and a key determinant of foreign body reactions Mast cells are one of the major effector cells in the pathogenesis of the immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction in a number of non-allergic immune disorders as well as in normal physiological processes.  Mast cells act as sensors in innate immunity and as effector cells in adaptive immune reactions.  : Allergic rhinitis is characterized by the epithelial accumulation of cells, particularly mast cells and eosinophils. Mast cells are important effector cells of the immune system and recent studies show that they have immunomodulatory roles in diverse processes in both health and disease. Biological functions of mast cells appear to include a role in innate immunity, involvement in host defense mechanisms against parasitic infestations, immunomodulation of the immune system, and tissue repair and angiogenesis Mast cells have long been known to play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of IgE-associated allergic disorders by their ability to release a wide variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. Mast cells are long-lived resident cells that are of great importance in an allergic reaction. Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased mast cell numbers and upregulation of the TNF receptor family member CD30, but the role of elevated CD30 expression is poorly understood.

5ace12be0340b9f058000007	Which gene is responsible for proper speech development?	The Key Regulator for Language and Speech Development, FOXP2, is a Novel Substrate for SUMOylation. Transcription factor forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) plays an essential role in the development of language and speech. Absence of a paternally inherited FOXP2 gene in developmental verbal dyspraxia. Mutations in FOXP2 cause developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), but only a few cases have been described. Our results indicate that absence of paternal FOXP2 is the cause of DVD in patients with SRS with maternal UPD7. The data also point to a role for differential parent-of-origin expression of FOXP2 in human speech development. Despite similarities in motor planning and execution between speech development and oral feeding competence, there have been no reports to date linking deletions within the FOXP2 gene to oral feeding impairments in the newborn. The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. The FOXP2 gene is important for the development of proper speech motor control in humans. BACKGROUND Mutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development. CNTNAP2 is known to be involved in the cause of language and speech disorders and autism spectrum disorder and is in the same pathway as FOXP2, another important language gene, which makes it a candidate gene for causal studies speech and language disorders such as stuttering. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language.	['FOXP2']

5c34ad63da8336e21a000007	Which genomic positions are preferentially selected for transposon insertion?	These results suggest that in Drosophila preferential insertion sites may be defined with the contribution of host factors, although alternative interpretations are also possible.  These data support the hypothesis that Tn916 has a marked preference for insertion into noncoding DNA for H. influenzae, suggesting that this mobile element has evolved to minimize disruption of host cell function on integration. Preferential integration points in the rye genome exist, because the new insertions seem to be located, in all studied cases, in the same genome positions.  However, a similar approach did not reveal any structural pattern of DNA that could be used to predict favored integration sites for other transposons as well as retroviruses and lentiviruses due to a limitation of available data sets. The FISH analysis of the pepper Tat elements showed a random distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato Tat elements showed heterochromatin-preferential accumulation No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed.

5c2f669e133db5eb78000031	How many genes in S. cerevisiae are the result of an ancient whole genome duplication?	By comparing three species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, and S. castellii) that underwent WGD to a nonduplicated outgroup (Kluyveromyces lactis), and by using a synteny framework to establish orthology and paralogy relationships at each duplicated locus, we show that 56% of ohnolog pairs show significantly asymmetric protein sequence evolution In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes.  The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication.	['2500']

5c59872b86df2b9174000017	Which tool has been developed for coverage calculation for genomes?	Mosdepth: quick coverage calculation for genomes and exomes. Mosdepth is a new command-line tool for rapidly calculating genome-wide sequencing coverage. It measures depth from BAM or CRAM files at either each nucleotide position in a genome or for sets of genomic regions. Genomic regions may be specified as either a BED file to evaluate coverage across capture regions, or as a fixed-size window as required for copy-number calling. Mosdepth uses a simple algorithm that is computationally efficient and enables it to quickly produce coverage summaries.

5c307474133db5eb78000033	Which complex is bound by estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb)?	Knockdown of Mp1 redirected FGF4 signaling from differentiation toward pluripotency and up-regulated the pluripotency-related genes Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, and Sox2. Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. Co-motif discovery identifies an Esrrb-Sox2-DNA ternary complex as a mediator of transcriptional differences between mouse embryonic and epiblast stem cells Through the use of knockdown experiments, we argue that the Esrrb-Sox2 complex is an arbiter of gene expression differences between ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC).  Nanog expression in epiblast is directly regulated by Nodal/Smad2 pathway in a visceral endoderm-dependent manner. Notably, Nanog promoters switch from Oct4/Esrrb in ICM/ESCs to Oct4/Smad2 in epiblasts. 	['The Esrrb-Sox2 complex']

Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4+ T cells compared with healthy controls Altered DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as histone modifications mediate changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in immune cells from SLE patients. DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark. On the other hand, certain miRNAs, RFX1, defective ERK pathway signaling, Gadd45α and DNA hydroxymethylation have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to DNA hypomethylation in lupus. Increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CD4(+) T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus.  Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer.  Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here we investigated whether 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis, was involved in regulating DNA hypomethylation and hyper-hydroxymethylation in lupus CD4<br> DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process.

5c588efb86df2b9174000004	What is the mechanism of action of Brigatinib?	Molecular inhibitory mechanism study on the potent inhibitor brigatinib against four crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations. As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer. In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib.   Together, the detailed explanation of mechanisms of those mutations with brigatinib further provide several guidelines for the development of more effective ALK inhibitors. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents.RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib.  With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n = 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n = 25). Lung toxicity is a rare albeit potentially severe side effect in NSCLC patients receiving ALK-TKIs, apparently more frequent with brigatinib.  Ceritinib and alectinib are approved for metastatic ALK positive NSCLC patients, while brigatinib received granted accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration.  Since the discovery, development and approval of crizotinib in 2011, three second-generation ALK-TKIs, ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib have been approved by the FDA. In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib. These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region. As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer. This report describes the design and synthesis of a series of 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine-based potent and selective ALK inhibitors culminating in identification of the investigational clinical candidate brigatinib. Brigatinib displayed low nanomolar IC50s against native ALK and all tested clinically relevant ALK mutants in both enzyme-based biochemical and cell-based viability assays and demonstrated efficacy in multiple ALK+ xenografts in mice, including Karpas-299 (anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [ALCL]) and H3122 (NSCLC).

The procedure was performed with the NeuroBlate SideFire probe.  The authors perform a systematic analysis of two commercially available MRgLITT systems used in neurosurgery: the Visualase® thermal therapy and NeuroBlate® Systems. We describe the history and rationale of laser neurosurgery as well as the two available SLT systems (Visualase® and NeuroBlate®; CE marks pending).  INTRODUCTION: We describe the feasibility of using minimally invasive robotic laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) for achieving an anterior two-thirds as well as a complete corpus callosotomy.METHODS: Ten probe trajectories were plotted on normal magentic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the Brainlab Stereotactic Planning Software (Brainlab, Munich, Germany). The NeuroBlate® System (Monteris Medical, MN, USA) was used to conform the thermal burn to the corpus callosum along the trajectory of the probe. Here, we briefly describe the history and rationale of laser neurosurgery as well as the technical key features of the two currently available systems for magnetic resonance-guided LiTT (Visualase®, NeuroBlate®; CE marks pending for both). We report our multicenter results of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in DTA-HGGs.

5c580aff07647bbc4b00001a	Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?	An Ultraconserved Element Containing lncRNA Preserves Transcriptional Dynamics and Maintains ESC Self-Renewal. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes. Most of them are transcribed and represent a new family of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the transcribed UCEs (T-UCEs). Despite their involvement in human cancer, the physiological role of T-UCEs is still unknown. Here, we identify a lncRNA containing the uc.170+, named T-UCstem1, and provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that it plays essential roles in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by modulating cytoplasmic miRNA levels and preserving transcriptional dynamics.

5c581e1507647bbc4b00001c	Which algorithm has been developed for trio-based benchmarking of variant calls?	geck: trio-based comparative benchmarking of variant calls. Classical methods of comparing the accuracies of variant calling pipelines are based on truth sets of variants whose genotypes are previously determined with high confidence. An alternative way of performing benchmarking is based on Mendelian constraints between related individuals. Statistical analysis of Mendelian violations can provide truth set-independent benchmarking information, and enable benchmarking less-studied variants and diverse populations.Results: We introduce a statistical mixture model for comparing two variant calling pipelines from genotype data they produce after running on individual members of a trio. We determine the accuracy of our model by comparing the precision and recall of GATK Unified Genotyper and Haplotype Caller on the high-confidence SNPs of the NIST Ashkenazim trio and the two independent Platinum Genome trios. We show that our method is able to estimate differential precision and recall between the two pipelines with 10-3 uncertainty.	['geck']
5c55d9b707647bbc4b000009	Which molecule is targeted by Caplacizumab?	Caplacizumab, a nanobody that blocks the interaction between VWF and platelets, has shown promising results in decreasing the time to recover from the acute events that will hopefully translate into long-term clinical benefit for patients. Ablynx, a Sanofi Company, has developed the anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® caplacizumab (Cablivi™) for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). Promising agents under evaluation include N-acetylcysteine, bortezomib, recombinant ADAMTS13 and caplacizumab, an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-von Willebrand factor axis. The most promising candidates for future treatment of TTP are: rituximab for termination of the autoimmune process, caplacizumab for prevention of platelet-VWF-interaction, and recombinant ADAMTS13 for replacement of the inhibited or missing enzyme. Promising agents under evaluation include caplacizumab (an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-Von-Willebrand factor axis), N-acetylcysteine, recombinant ADAMTS13, and anti-plasmocyte compounds.  In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. It is now anticipated that the first VHH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter.

5c5f264b1a4c55d80b00001e	What is the function of Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1?	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plays a critical role in fibrinolysis.  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene product of SERPINE1, inhibited cell adhesion, suggesting that PAI-1, like THBS1, has anti-angiogenic properties.  Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a crucial regulator of fibrinolysis, is increased in sepsis, but its values in predicting disease severity or mortality outcomes have been controversial	['PAI-1 is important in fibrinolysis.']
5c6aef167c78d69471000023	Which tool has been developed for GPU-accelerated alignment of bisulfite-treated DNA sequences?	Arioc: GPU-accelerated alignment of short bisulfite-treated reads. The alignment of bisulfite-treated DNA sequences (BS-seq reads) to a large genome involves a significant computational burden beyond that required to align non-bisulfite-treated reads. In the analysis of BS-seq data, this can present an important performance bottleneck that can be mitigated by appropriate algorithmic and software-engineering improvements. One strategy is to modify the read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to BS-seq alignment, with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be attainable.Results: We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the BS-seq computational logic into both GPU and CPU code throughout the Arioc implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing BS-seq aligners across a wide range of sensitivity settings. Results We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq read aligners.	['Arioc']

5c61d278e842deac67000005	Which disease can be classified with the Awaji Criteria?	Adoption of the Awaji criteria significantly increased the yield of EMG-positive segments in the cervical (P < 0.0005) and lumbosacral (P < 0.0001) regions, and upgraded 19 patients into the probable category and 1 patient into the definite category. The Awaji criteria increases the diagnostic sensitivity of the revised El Escorial criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis in a Chinese population. However, previous studies that have assessed the diagnostic sensitivities of the Awaji criteria (AC) and the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in patients with ALS have been inconsistent, most of them were consensual regarding the advantage of Awaji over conventional criteria. Our study sought to compare the roles of AC and rEEC in the diagnosis of ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that the AC exhibited greater diagnostic sensitivity than the rEEC in a Chinese ALS population.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the added prognostic value of the aggregated clinical and electrodiagnostic data, which define a given diagnostic category according to the Awaji or revised El Escorial criteria at time of diagnosis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Diagnostic category according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0177) criteria, definite ALS according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0343) and number of regions with LMN involvement (p < 0.0001) were all associated with shorter survival. Methods: This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study including a consecutive series of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to Awaji's criteria.  The importance of fasciculation potentials in the diagnosis of ALS led to changes in electrophysiological criteria at Awaji consensus conference.  Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies. STUDY SELECTION We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS. CONCLUSION The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS. In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Awaji and revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Awaji Commission recently proposed a modification of the electrodiagnostic criteria for ALS. INTRODUCTION Recently, some authors have claimed that the Awaji criteria (AC) are not always more sensitive than the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The updated Awaji criteria enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity in limb-onset ALS. BACKGROUND Recently, new electrophysiological ALS criteria incorporating fasciculation potentials (FPs) as evidence for lower motor neuron signs (Awaji Criteria (AC)) was proposed to provide earlier detection of early-stage ALS than revised El Escorial electrophysiological criteria (REEC). The Awaji criteria, recently introduced to increase diagnosis sensitivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), equate the diagnostic significance of neurogenic electrophysiological changes to clinical signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months. New diagnostic criteria for ALS, the Awaji algorithm, reintroduced fasciculations as evidence of acute denervation equivalent to that of fibrillations and positive sharp waves. Given that cortical hyperexcitability appears to be an early feature in ALS, the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation technique as an aid to the research-based Awaji criteria in establishing an earlier diagnosis of ALS. The specificity of the both criteria were identical, 99.5%, indicating the number needed to test in order to diagnose one extra case of ALS was 1.8 (1.5-2) for Awaji criteria and 2.4 (2-2.6) for rEEC.  We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS.  Our retrospective analysis of patients referred over a 6-month period to the electromyography (EMG) laboratory for suspected motor neuron disease (MND) showed a higher agreement of the Awaji modifications than the Airlie House criteria with the clinical diagnosis of ALS. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months.  Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.  <b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies.<br><b>DATA SOURCES</b>: MEDLINE and Web of Science (until October2011).<br><b>STUDY SELECTION</b>: We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS.<br><b>DATA EXTRACTION</b>: Evaluation and data extraction of identified studies were done independently. Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. Diagnostic accuracy of Awaji criteria was higher in bulbar- than in limb-onset cases.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS.<br> We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS. Using the El Escorial criteria, 51 patients were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS, 14 with probable laboratory-supported ALS, and 28 with possible ALS. Applying the Awaji recommendations, 66 patients were diagnosed with either definite or probable ALS, and 27 with possible ALS. Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.

In this commentary, we review literature on sexual behavior change accompanying PrEP use, discuss risk compensation concerns and the &amp;quot;Truvada whore&amp;quot; stereotype as PrEP barriers, question the appropriateness of restricting PrEP access because of risk compensation, and consider sexual pleasure as a benefit of PrEP, an acceptable motive for seeking PrEP, and a core element of health.  BACKGROUND Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. In January 2011, following publication of evidence of safety and efficacy of daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (TDF)/emtricitabine 200 mg (FTC) (Truvada, Gilead Sciences) as antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk for HIV acquisition among MSM in the iPrEx trial, CDC issued interim guidance to make available information and important initial cautions on the use of PrEP in this population. Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. BACKGROUND Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples. Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety). The pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug Truvada is a new HIV prevention technology that is predominantly promoted as relevant to HIV-negative gay men. INTRODUCTION The FEM-PrEP trial was a pre-exposure prophylaxis clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine) in the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using the antiretroviral drug emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of HIV acquisition for women at higher risk of infection if taken daily. Third, Truvada can be used prophylactically to prevent transmission of HIV infection. Daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (emtricitabine FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate TDF) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to reduce HIV incidence among men who have sex with men. It is the only drug approved to prevent HIV infections, and Truvada is the key pharmaceutical component of pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is aimed at preventing, rather than treating, HIV infection and transmission.

Loss-of-function nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans. The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort.METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. CONCLUSION We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

5c7839edd774d04240000003	When is serum AFP used as marker?	AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients Post-hepatectomy HLs of AFP and DCP are predictors of long-term outcome in patients with HCC. Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs) are uncommon neoplasms that are occasionally associated with an elevated level of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of germ cell neoplasms, particularly yolk sac tumor (YST).  Serum α-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used diagnostic biomarker, but it has limited sensitivity and is not elevated in all HCC cases so, we incorporate a second blood-based biomarker, des'γ carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), that has shown potential as a screening marker for HCC. In addition, AFP, a hepatic stem cell marker, was expressed at the highest level in the control groups.	['in HCC', 'Hepato cellular carcinoma']

5c54d1a207647bbc4b000007	What is nyctinasty in plants?	Leguminous plants open their leaves during the daytime and close them at night as if sleeping, a type of movement that follows circadian rhythms, and is known as nyctinastic movement The chemical aspects of the circadian leaf movement known as "nyctinasty" are discussed in this paper. Periodic leaf-movement of legumes is called nyctinasty and has been known since the age of Alexander the Great.  Foliar nyctinasty is a plant behaviour characterised by a pronounced daily oscillation in leaf orientation. We found that nyctinasty is controlled by a periodic change of the internal concentration of leaf-opening and leaf-closing substances in the plant body. The circadian leaf opening and closing (nyctinasty) of Fabaceae has attracted scientists' attention since the era of Charles Darwin.	['movement of leguminous plants in response to darkness']
5c51fb7a07ef653866000006	Which deep learning algorithm has been developed for variant calling?	Despite rapid advances in sequencing technologies, accurately calling genetic variants present in an individual genome from billions of short, errorful sequence reads remains challenging. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships between images of read pileups around putative variant and true genotype calls. The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling.

5c71d7ca7c78d6947100006b	Erenumab, used to treat migraine headaches, binds to what protein?	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling are being explored as prophylactic treatments for migraine. Erenumab (AMG 334) is the first potent, selective, and competitive human mAb antagonist of the CGRP receptor. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). To date, these monoclonal antibodies have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials, with no major safety concerns. If ongoing long-term studies show that their efficacy can be maintained, this may herald a new era for effective antimigraine therapies. BACKGROUND Migraine prevention with erenumab and migraine induction by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) both carry notable individual variance. Background We evaluated the effect of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, on migraine-related disability, impact, and health-related quality of life among patients with episodic migraine. Erenumab is a novel CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. Results - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erenumab, an anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody, for prevention of migraine May 17, 2018. Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention. BACKGROUND We tested erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, for the prevention of episodic migraine. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018. CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks. Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine. BACKGROUND We tested erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, for the prevention of episodic migraine.

5c72ade07c78d69471000070	Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug Lorlatinib?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents.RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib. IMPORTANCE: The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in 2-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients led to the rapid clinical development of its oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment. RESULTS: ALK T1151Sins mutation was detected when the patient developed resistance to ceritinib, and undetectable when she responded to lorlatinib.  ALK G1202R, the most frequent plasma mutation detected after progression on a second-generation TKI, was consistently suppressed during treatment with lorlatinib. Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011).  Brain Penetration of the ROS1/ALK Inhibitor Lorlatinib Confirmed by PET.F-labeling strategies to synthesize isotopologs of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) which is undergoing phase III clinical trial investigations for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with specific molecular alterations.  In addition, further functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ALK harboring the T1151Sins mutation, while conferring resistance to ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib. Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts brain accumulation and cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits oral availability of the novel ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib. Lorlatinib is a third generation ALK inhibitor that inhibits most ALK mutants resistant to current ALK inhibitors. Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a next-generation small-molecule inhibitor of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which has a kinase domain that is physiologically related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trial investigations for non-small cell lung cancers. BACKGROUND Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations. The next-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib (PF-06463922) has therefore been developed to inhibit resistant ALK mutations, including ALK G1202R, and to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. BACKGROUND Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations.	['anaplastic lymphoma kinase']

5c7813f57c78d694710000b0	How does the Cholera toxin enter a cell?	Cholera toxin (CT), which is secreted by V. cholerae, can enter host cells by binding to GM1, a monosialoganglioside widely distributed on the plasma membrane surface of various animal epithelial cells.  The five B-subunits (CTB5) of the Vibrio cholerae (cholera) toxin can bind to the intestinal cell surface so the entire AB5 toxin can enter the cell. Simultaneous binding can occur on more than one of the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) units present on the cell surface.  we test the role of glycolipid crosslinking as a raft targeting and ordering mechanism using the well-studied raft marker cholera toxin B pentamer (CTxB) that binds up to five GM1 glycosphingolipids to enter host cells.

Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Discovery of AG-120 (Ivosidenib): A First-in-Class Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of IDH1 Mutant Cancers. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo.   Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. A phase I study suggests that ivosidenib can induce remission in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia characterized by IDH1 mutations. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). The FDA approved ivosidenib for patients with IDH1-mutant relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.  Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®) is a small molecule, orally available inhibitor of mutated cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that is being developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer in patients with IDH1 mutations.

5c72f6b17c78d6947100007f	Which enzyme is deficient in Wolman disease?	Wolman's disease, also known as lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) deficiency, is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by complete absence of the LIPA enzyme. The diagnosis of Wolman's disease was made postnatally by biochemical testing, which indicated absence of LIPA enzyme activity and gene sequencing, which confirmed homozygosity for the G66V mutation within the LIPA gene. These include Wolman disease (WD) and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) which both result from mutations in LIPA, the gene that encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). BACKGROUND: Deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) causes Wolman disease and cholesterol ester storage disease.  BACKGROUND: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease with a wide range of severity from Wolman Disease to Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease.   In humans, loss-of-function mutations of LIPA cause rare lysosomal disorders, Wolman disease, and cholesteryl ester storage disease, in which LAL enzyme replacement therapy has shown significant benefits in a phase 3 clinical trial.  Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD, OMIM #278000) and Wolman disease (OMIM #278000) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (cholesteryl ester hydrolase, LAL). Wolman disease, associated with deficient hLAL activity, leads to massive intracellular substrate accumulation and is always fatal in early infancy. We previously reported a rat model of Wolman's disease (Wolman rat) that is deficient for LAL activity. BACKGROUND Wolman disease (WD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by mutations in the LIPA gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). We report successful long-term bone marrow engraftment in a patient with Wolman disease resulting in continued normalization of peripheral leukocyte lysosomal acid lipase enzyme activity. A new mutation in the gene for lysosomal acid lipase leads to Wolman disease in an African kindred. Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease (WD) are both autosomal recessive disorders associated with reduced activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). In Wolman disease, LAL activity is usually absent, whereas CESD usually presents some residual LAL activity. Wolman disease, associated with deficient hLAL activity, leads to massive intracellular substrate accumulation and is always fatal in early infancy.  Acta 1006, 84-88], has been administered to cultured lymphoblastoid cells from normal subjects and from a patient affected with Wolman disease, which is characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase.  A new mutation in the gene for lysosomal acid lipase leads to Wolman disease in an African kindred.Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease (WD) are both autosomal recessive disorders associated with reduced activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL).  Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease.Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD, OMIM #278000) and Wolman disease (OMIM #278000) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (cholesteryl ester hydrolase, LAL).  Restoration of a regulatory response to low density lipoprotein in acid lipase-deficient human fibroblasts.Previous studies have shown that cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase (i. e. the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease) are defective in their ability to hydrolyze the cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL).  Molecular defects underlying Wolman disease appear to be more heterogeneous than those resulting in cholesteryl ester storage disease.Human lysosomal acid lipase/cholesteryl ester hydrolase (hLAL) is essential for the intralysosomal metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles.  In order to elucidate the underlying molecular defects in Wolman disease, we have characterized the hLAL gene in two female Wolman patients of German and Turkish origin by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis.

5c89623bf9c2ba6b28000005	Which cancer is associated with increased levels of Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) ?	In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P < .001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs) are uncommon neoplasms that are occasionally associated with an elevated level of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of germ cell neoplasms, particularly yolk sac tumor (YST).  Serum α-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used diagnostic biomarker, but it has limited sensitivity and is not elevated in all HCC cases so, we incorporate a second blood-based biomarker, des'γ carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), that has shown potential as a screening marker for HCC.  Cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and surveillance with ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended.  The combination of enhancement patterns on CEUS and serum tumor markers (AFP and CA19-9) may be a potentially specific diagnostic method to differentiate CHC from HCC and CC.

5c73acef7c78d69471000088	Which receptor is targeted by Erenumab?	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling are being explored as prophylactic treatments for migraine. Erenumab (AMG 334) is the first potent, selective, and competitive human mAb antagonist of the CGRP receptor.  Erratum: Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor as a novel target for the management of people with episodic migraine: current evidence and safety profile of erenumab [Corrigendum]. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab).  Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab).  Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor as a novel target for the management of people with episodic migraine: current evidence and safety profile of erenumab. Erenumab is the only mAb that targets the CGRP receptor instead of the ligand, with high specificity and affinity of binding. BACKGROUND We tested erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, for the prevention of episodic migraine. We assessed the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the CGRP receptor, in patients with chronic migraine. Erenumab is a novel CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). Erenumab (AMG 334) is the first potent, selective, and competitive human mAb antagonist of the CGRP receptor. OBJECTIVE To assess long-term safety and efficacy of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor erenumab in patients with episodic migraine (EM). CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks. Currently, 4 monoclonal antibodies targeting either the CGRP ligand or receptor are being studied for migraine prevention: ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG 334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab), and TEV-48125 (fremanezumab). Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine. OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of erenumab, a human anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, on total exercise time (TET), time to exercise-induced angina, and ST depression in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with stable angina due to documented coronary artery disease. Background We evaluated the effect of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, on migraine-related disability, impact, and health-related quality of life among patients with episodic migraine. METHODS Thirteen migraine patients, previously enrolled in erenumab anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody trials, received CGRP in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design to investigate their susceptibility to migraine induction. Currently, 4 monoclonal antibodies targeting either the CGRP ligand or receptor are being studied for migraine prevention: ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG 334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab), and TEV-48125 (fremanezumab).  Erenumab did not adversely affect exercise time in a high cardiovascular risk population of patients, supporting that inhibition of the canonical CGRP receptor does not worsen myocardial ischemia.

5c73ad077c78d69471000090	Safinamide is approved for treatment of which disease?	Safinamide has been recently approved as an add-on to levodopa therapy for Parkinson disease.   These data are consistent with the anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian actions of safinamide and provide support for the nondopaminergic mechanism of its action. Safinamide: a new hope for Parkinson's disease? The loss of dopaminergic neurons (DAn) and reduced dopamine (DA) production underlies the reasoning behind the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) using levodopa (L-DOPA). Recently licensed by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), safinamide [a monoamine oxidase B (MOA-B) inhibitor] is an alternative to L-DOPA; as we discuss here, it enhances dopaminergic transmission with decreased secondary effects compared with L-DOPA.  Overall, safinamide can be considered to have potential antidyskinetic and neuroprotective effects and future trials and/or studies should be performed to provide further evidence for its potential as an anti-PD drug. Real life evaluation of safinamide effectiveness in Parkinson's disease. In this retrospective study, we evaluated both efficacy and effectiveness of safinamide 50 and 100 mg in the treatment of motor fluctuations and disabling dyskinesias in a cohort of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).  In conclusion, safinamide is safe and effective in improving motor complications in patients with idiopathic PD and can be considered a useful levodopa sparing strategy. Safinamide: an add-on treatment for managing Parkinson's disease. Safinamide (Xadago - Zambon S.p.A) is a monoamine-oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor licensed as add-on therapy for people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations with levodopa.

Pannexins are a family of integral membrane proteins with distinct post-translational modifications, sub-cellular localization and tissue distribution.  Pannexins (Panx1, 2, 3) are channel-forming glycoproteins expressed in mammalian tissues. Pannexins (Panx) are proteins with a similar membrane topology to connexins, the integral membrane protein of gap junctions. Panx1 channels are generally of major importance in a large number of system and cellular processes and their function has been thoroughly characterized. In contrast, little is known about channel structure and subcellular distribution. Pannexins (Panxs) are a multifaceted family of ion and metabolite channels that play key roles in a number of physiological and pathophysiological settings. These single membrane large-pore channels exhibit a variety of tissue, cell type, and subcellular distributions.

5c8fef490101eac870000010	Through which protein interaction does MLP regulate F-actin dynamics?	Muscle LIM protein interacts with cofilin 2 and regulates F-actin dynamics in cardiac and skeletal muscle. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease.

5c72f5247c78d6947100007e	Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?	Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene. Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Exome sequencing revealed a novel biallelic deletion in the DCAF17 gene underlying Woodhouse Sakati syndrome. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements.  The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that was first described in 1983.

5cb0856decadf2e73f000058	Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a drug target and is involved in what biosynthetic pathway	The flavoenzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth reaction of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, which exerts vital functions in the cells, especially within DNA and RNA biosynthesis.  Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (HsDHODH) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) mediates the fourth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and is a proven drug target for inducing immunosuppression in therapy of human disease as well as a rapidly emerging drug target for treatment of malaria. This review focuses on recent studies to exploit the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of P. falciparum, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), as a new target for drug discovery. The flavoenzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzes the stereoselective oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate in the fourth of the six conserved enzymatic reactions involved in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. A set of compounds designed to inhibit the Plasmodium falciparum pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) was synthesized. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) is the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and is essential in Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasitic protist causing Chagas' disease. Hence, we evaluated the essentiality of one enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) from the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei through gene knockdown studies. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme catalyzing the only redox reaction of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, is a well-characterized target for chemotherapeutical intervention. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) for P. falciparum potentially represents a new treatment option for malaria, since DHODH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and P. falciparum is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. An important target for antimalarial chemotherapy is the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Plasmodium falciparum (PfDHODH), which is responsible for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway which is an important target for anti-hyperproliferative and anti-inflammatory drug design. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and has been exploited as the target for therapy against proliferative and parasitic diseases. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and represents a potential target for anti-malarial therapy. The enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine-biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, two enzymes of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, were purified from Plasmodium berghei to apparent homogeneity. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), a mitochondrially localized flavoenzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of this pathway and is therefore an attractive antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (HsDHODH) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme catalyzing the only redox reaction of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, is a well-characterized target for chemotherapeutical intervention.  Biochemical and molecular characterization of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Toxoplasma gondii.The pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is essential for parasite growth during infection.  This review focuses on recent studies to exploit the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of P. falciparum, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), as a new target for drug discovery.  The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium (DuP 785, NSC 368390, 6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline- carboxylic acid sodium salt) was shown previously to be an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, is the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis and is used to oxidize dihydroorotate and hence to orotat. The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium [DuP 785, NSC 368390, 6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid sodium salt] inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of UMP.

5c960f21ecadf2e73f000020	What are DMARDs?	To determine the utility of ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  [DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs)]. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have largely contributed to recent paradigm shift of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategy. BACKGROUND Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are increasingly used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Tocilizumab (TCZ) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response (IR) to prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disorder of joints that is associated with high health care costs, yet guidance is lacking on how early to initiate biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a class of medications that is the major cost driver in RA management. BACKGROUND Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is typically characterized by the sequential use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). There are only six DMARDs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) available in the clinical practice, such as gold sodium thiomalate, D-penicillamine, bucillamine, auranofin, salazosulphapyridine, and lobenzarit disodium. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz(®)) is the first approved drug in a new class of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. OBJECTIVE Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard of care for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, studies have found that many patients do not receive them. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pharmacotherapy and should be initiated promptly after RA diagnosis. OBJECTIVES When rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have achieved sustained good clinical responses can their disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) be reduced or discontinued? BACKGROUND Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. BACKGROUND Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve outcomes compared to conventional therapy (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroids). Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of drugs which is used as medication in various arthritic conditions to arrest the progression of disease along with relief from pain. For this purpose, all patients with the diagnosis of RA should be treated by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including biologic DMARDs and non-biologic DMARDs. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Patients and rheumatologists have a number of options to consider for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). To explore what considerations patients have when deciding about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and what information patients need to participate in the decision-making process. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy is now clearly accepted as the primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, with an increasing emphasis on use of combination therapy. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? The efficacy of the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) shown in clinical trials may be jeopardized due to prevalent poor patient adherence. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism.

5c9fb428ecadf2e73f000041	Salivary Cortisol is a biomarker for what disease/syndrome/condition?	Salivary cortisone, as a biomarker for psychosocial stress, is associated with state anxiety and heart rate. ortisol as a stress biomarker The salivary cortisol level reflects psychological stress, and it is a good index to assess chronic stress. SUMMARY Salivary cortisol and cortisone can be used to assess cortisol excess, deficiency and hydrocortisone replacement, with salivary cortisone having the advantage of detection when serum cortisol levels are low and there is no interference from oral hydrocortisone. Salivary cortisone is a superior marker of serum cortisol compared with salivary cortisol, specifically when serum cortisol is low and during hydrocortisone therapy when contamination of saliva may result in misleading salivary cortisol concentrations. Salivary cortisol is frequently used as a biomarker of psychological stress. The present paper addresses several psychological and biological variables, which may account for such dissociations, and aims to help researchers to rate the validity and psychobiological significance of salivary cortisol as an HPAA biomarker of stress in their experiments. However, psychobiological mechanisms, which trigger the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) can only indirectly be assessed by salivary cortisol measures. Salivary cortisol as a biomarker in stress research. As a biomarker for depression, salivary cortisol VAR demonstrated an optimal cutoff point at 77.8% (AUC=0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98), which is associated with a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 96.0%. Salivary cortisol is considered to be a safe and noninvasive measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, and is a commonly measured biomarker of the human stress response in pediatric research. BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), considered a non-invasive biomarker for sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and salivary cortisol as possible pain-induced stress biomarker, in horses with acute abdominal disease. Salivary cortisol is commonly used as a clinical biomarker of endocrine status and also as a marker of psychosocial stress. CONCLUSION Salivary cortisol concentration is positively correlated with occupational stress and increases with the increasing degree of occupational stress, and can be used as an objective biomarker for the identification and evaluation of occupational stress. PURPOSE Cortisol is frequently assayed as a stress-responsive biomarker which changes over the course of minutes to meet the demands of a person's social context. METHODS In 323 children (5-10 years old) participating in the Belgian ChiBS study, salivary cortisol samples, a biomarker for stress, was sampled when waking up, 30 and 60 min after wake up and in the evening on two consecutive weekdays. Cortisol is a classical biomarker for the stress levels of human beings. Finally, salivary cortisol has been used extensively as a biomarker of stress in a research setting, especially in studies examining psychological stress with repeated measurements.

5c8aa082d558e5f23200000c	What is the function of the cGAS pathway?	Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a bacterial signaling nucleotide synthesized by several human pathogens. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been identified as the primary protein that detects cytosolic double stranded DNA to invoke a type I interferon response. The cGAS pathway is vital in the recognition of DNA encoded viruses as well as self-DNA leaked from the nucleus of damaged cells.  These results indicate that activation of the cGAS pathway is important for intrinsic antitumor immunity and that cGAMP may be used directly for cancer immunotherapy.  this work identifies long DNA as the molecular entity stimulating the cGAS pathway upon cytosolic DNA challenge such as viral infections. these data suggest that inactivation of the cGAS pathway plays a critical role in tumour progression, and reveal a direct link between hypoxia-responsive miRNAs and adaptive immune responses to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, thus unveiling potential new therapeutic strategies. dysregulation of the cGAS pathway is linked to autoimmune diseases while targeted stimulation may be of benefit in immunoncology.  The cGAS-STING pathway not only mediates protective immune defense against infection by a large variety of DNA-containing pathogens but also detects tumor-derived DNA and generates intrinsic antitumor immunity.  our data indicate that the cGAS-STING pathway plays a role in the surveillance of HBV infection and may be exploited for development of novel anti-HBV strategies.

5caa06d0ecadf2e73f000056	Where in the body, is ghrelin secreted?	Ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, is secreted from endocrine cells in the gastric mucosa. Ghrelin is a recently described hormone secreted by the stomach. BACKGROUND Ghrelin is secreted mainly in the stomach and plays a role in food intake regulation. BACKGROUND Ghrelin is a body weight-regulating peptide produced and secreted primarily by the gastric mucosa. These results suggest that (1) endogenous centrally released ghrelin participates in the regulation of food intake and body weight, (2) acyl ghrelin is secreted from the stomach, (3) intestinal hormones stimulate ghrelin release from the stomach, and (4) regulation of the diurnal rhythm of ghrelin is complex, since ghrelin secretion is augmented under conditions of both gastric emptying and filling. Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide secreted mainly by the stomach. Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the stomach and has been implicated in the coordination of eating behavior and weight regulation. Most of the ghrelin produced in the body is secreted in the stomach, but it is also expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, intestine, kidney, heart and gonads. OBJECTIVES Ghrelin, a recently discovered hormone mainly secreted by the stomach, has several metabolic functions including regulation of food intake, energy homeostasis and body weight. PURPOSE Ghrelin is mainly secreted from the stomach and plays a role in appetite, weight gain, and the promotion of a positive energy balance.

5d3852d07bc3fee31f000014	Where is the yeast transpozable element Ty3 preferentially inserted?	We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77 %) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. The retrovirus-like element Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates at the transcription initiation region of RNA polymerase III. Ty3 inserts at transcription initiation sites of genomic tRNA genes and plasmid-borne 5S and U6 RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.  Sites of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation and Ty3 integration at the U6 gene are positioned by the TATA box  the U6 TATA box is essential in vivo for correct initiation but not for transcription, (ii) a TATA box does not compensate for a weak box A sequence and so cannot perform equivalently, and (iii) the TATA-binding protein, and probably components of transcription factor IIIB, are present on the target at the time of Ty3 integration. Ty3 integrates within the region of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation Ty3 was shown to insert upstream of tRNA, 5S, and U6 genes, all of which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III Transfer RNA genes are genomic targets for de Novo transposition of the yeast retrotransposon Ty3. Thus, genomic insertions of Ty3 in a particular orientation are apparently specified by the target, while the actual position of the insertion relative to the tRNA-coding sequence can vary slightly.

5e35dc26158f994d3a000006	How many proteins have been queried for protein partners by the Drosophila protein interaction map (DPiM)?	Proteins perform essential cellular functions as part of protein complexes, often in conjunction with RNA, DNA, metabolites and other small molecules. The genome encodes thousands of proteins but not all of them are expressed in every cell type; and expressed proteins are not active at all times. Such diversity of protein expression and function accounts for the level of biological intricacy seen in nature. Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex "map" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization. Here we describe how the map has provided valuable insights into protein function in addition to generating hundreds of testable hypotheses. We also discuss recent technological advancements that will be critical in addressing the next generation of questions arising from the map.	['5,000']

We report acute tetraplegia caused by rat bite fever in a 59-year old man (snake keeper) and transmission of Streptobacillus moniliformis.  BACKGROUND: The Leptotrichiaceae are a family of fairly unnoticed bacteria containing both microbiota on mucous membranes as well as significant pathogens such as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative organism of streptobacillary rat bite fever.  BACKGROUND  The Leptotrichiaceae are a family of fairly unnoticed bacteria containing both microbiota on mucous membranes as well as significant pathogens such as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative organism of streptobacillary rat bite fever. One of the two etiological agents that cause rat bite fever is Streptobacillus moniliformis. Rat bite fever is a rare infection typically caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis. Rat bite fever and Streptobacillus moniliformis. Rat bite fever, caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis, is a systemic illness classically characterized by fever, rigors, and polyarthralgias. Streptobacillus moniliformis is a Gram-negative bacterium found in various laboratory animal species and is the cause of rat bite fever and Haverhill fever in man The bacterium was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis , the agent of rat-bite fever Streptobacillus moniliformis ( Sm) , the causative agent of rat-bite fever and Haverhill fever in man , is also a pathogen in certain laboratory and domestic animals The Leptotrichiaceae are a family of fairly unnoticed bacteria containing both microbiota on mucous membranes as well as significant pathogens such as Streptobacillus moniliformis , the causative organism of streptobacillary rat bite fever Rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis induces typical but not pathognomonic clinical signs , such as local purulent wound infection followed by maculopapular exanthema , myalgia as well as purulent joint infections Streptobacillus moniliformis is a fastidious growing Gram-negative bacillus responsible of rat-bite fever Infections after bite wounds : For example rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis One of the two etiological agents that cause rat bite fever is Streptobacillus moniliformis. Rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis induces typical but not pathognomonic clinical signs, such as local purulent wound infection followed by maculopapular exanthema, myalgia as well as purulent joint infections. Rat-bite fever is an uncommon bacterial illness resulting from infection with Streptobacillus moniliformis that is often transmitted by the bite of a rat. We determined that he had bacteraemia caused by a Streptobacillus moniliformis infection, which led to the development of an illness called rat bite fever.	['Streptobacillus moniliformis']
5e5e502a1af46fc13000000a	What receptor is associated with the protein encoded by the Spätzle gene?	 In Drosophila, apoptotic elimination of the weaker "loser" cells from growing wing discs is induced by a signaling module consisting of the Toll ligand Spätzle (Spz), several Toll-related receptors, and NF-κB factors The Drosophila Toll-1 receptor is involved in embryonic development, innate immunity, and tissue homeostasis. Currently, as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor, only Spätzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The ligand for the Toll receptor is thought to be spätzle (spz), a secreted protein that is activated by proteolytic cleavage. Spätzle protein is an extracellular ligand of Toll receptor in Toll signaling pathway involved in the embryonic dorsoventral patterning and in the innate immunity. spätzle acts immediately upstream of the membrane protein Toll in the genetic pathway, suggesting that spätzle could encode the ventrally localized ligand that activates the receptor activity of Toll. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The canonical Toll receptor (Toll-1) is activated by the cytokine Spätzle (Spz-1), but Drosophila encodes eight other Toll genes and five other Spz genes whose interactions with one another and associated functions are less well-understood.

5e30b870fbd6abf43b000038	Which graph database is used by the Reactome graph database?	Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery.

5e6de3f21af46fc130000022	What is the target of the drug remdesivir?	We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.  Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.  In non-human primates, early initiation of polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and remdesivir improves survival, but whether they could be effective in patients is unknown.	['polymerase']
5e36d5b9b5b409ea53000009	Which algorithm has been developed for detecting expansions of tandem repeats?	Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that , using PCR-free WGS short-read data , can genotype repeats at the locus of interest , even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length	['ExpansionHunter']

5e36a718b5b409ea53000004	Which T-UCR has been implicated in prostate cancer?	Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. Docetaxel is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, nearly all patients ultimately become refractory due to the development of docetaxel resistance. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a corticosteroid-refractory flare of UC who did not respond to calcineurin inhibitors and received continuing salvage therapy with adalimumab were included in this retrospective, observational, single-centre study. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission and response were evaluated based on the Rachmilewitz index.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index.  A prospective open-label, single-center study was performed in 10 patients with active UC (Rachmilewitz Clinical Activity Index [CAI] ≥ 8 points; Rachmilewitz Endoscopic Index ≥ 7 points).  METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate IBD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <220 or Rachmilewitz Index (RI) <11) were randomized 1:1 to either supervised moderate-intensity running thrice a week for 10 weeks or a control group who were not prescribed any exercise.  BACKGROUND: To investigate whether anxiety and depression levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).METHODS: The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Endoscopic disease activities were scored independently according to the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD in patients with CD and to the Rachmilewitz Index in patients with UC. The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index.

We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and geographically matched controls.  In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population. Further population and functional studies will be of particular importance to establish TNFR2 as one of the susceptibility genes to SLE. Thus, among the non-synonymous cSNPs, only nt587 (T-->G) (M196R) was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Japanese. No transmission distortion was observed for TNFR2-196R allele.  Lack of association between the Met196Arg polymorphism in the TNFR2 gene and autoimmune diseases accompanied by vasculitis including SLE in Japanese.	["3' flanking region"]
5e49c2356d0a277941000010	Which database exists that contains regulatory SNPs which affect predicted transcription factor binding site affinity?	SNP2TFBS - a database of regulatory SNPs affecting predicted transcription factor binding site affinity. SNP2TFBS is a computational resource intended to support researchers investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in the human genome. The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor. These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive SNP catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual SNP, to extract SNPs based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of SNPs or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected SNPs.

5e52a4ec6d0a277941000044	Which R package has been developed for MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics?	Phosphonormalizer: an R package for normalization of MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics. Global centering-based normalization is a commonly used normalization approach in mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. It scales the peptide abundances to have the same median intensities, based on an assumption that the majority of abundances remain the same across the samples. However, especially in phosphoproteomics, this assumption can introduce bias, as the samples are enriched during sample preparation which can mask the underlying biological changes. To address this possible bias, phosphopeptides quantified in both enriched and non-enriched samples can be used to calculate factors that mitigate the bias.Results: We present an R package phosphonormalizer for normalizing enriched samples in label-free mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Availability and implementation: The phosphonormalizer package is freely available under GPL ( > =2) license from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/phosphonormalizer).

5e3eba5548dab47f26000009	The virus that causes FIP, Feline Infectious Peritonitis belongs to what family?	Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common and highly lethal coronavirus disease of domestic cats Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an etiological agent that causes a benign enteric illness and the fatal systemic disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).  Feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection is very common in cats, usually causing only mild intestinal signs such as diarrhoea. Up to 10% of FCoV infections, however, result in the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).  Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases of cats worldwide. The causative agent of this deadly disease, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), arises from feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species.

5d38577b7bc3fee31f000017	What is the main difference between nascent and mature chromatin?	Maturation of nucleosomal and nonnucleosomal components of nascent chromatin: differential requirements for concurrent protein synthesis. this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure  Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin).

5e50123e6d0a277941000036	Which programming language has been used for implementing GWAR?	In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there is a variety of statistical techniques in order to conduct the analysis, but, in most cases, the underlying genetic model is usually unknown. Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results: The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls. Overall, this is the first complete effort to implement procedures for analysis and meta-analysis in GWAS using Stata.Availability and Implementation: A Stata program and a web-server are freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/GWAR.

5e52be146d0a27794100004a	Which type of distance is used in the R-package XenofilteR?	XenofilteR: computational deconvolution of mouse and human reads in tumor xenograft sequence data. Mouse xenografts from (patient-derived) tumors (PDX) or tumor cell lines are widely used as models to study various biological and preclinical aspects of cancer. However, analyses of their RNA and DNA profiles are challenging, because they comprise reads not only from the grafted human cancer but also from the murine host. The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary.RESULTS: We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome. To assess the accuracy of XenofilteR, we generated sequence data by in silico mixing of mouse and human DNA sequence data. These analyses revealed that XenofilteR removes > 99.9% of sequence reads of mouse origin while retaining human sequences. This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.CONCLUSIONS: XenofilteR accurately dissects RNA and DNA sequences from mouse and human origin, thereby outperforming currently available tools.

The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects. Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power to detect such signals through meta-analyses. In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing, storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS.

5d387f24a1e1595105000013	How long in bp is the human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2)?	The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes.  The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome.  The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution  The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome.  This map extends 2.3 Mbp from the telomere to sex-chromosome-specific DNA, includes at least seven CpG islands and locates four genetically mapped loci. 	['320kbp']
5e36dc8cb5b409ea5300000d	What is another name for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)?	Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMd, Niemann-Pick disease A/B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B).  Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficient Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene. The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form.  BACKGROUND  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Introduction  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase.

5e31cb85fbd6abf43b00004e	What gene is mutated in Huntington's Disease patients?	Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant neurodegenerative disease caused by a dominantly inherited CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the HD disease protein, huntingtin (HTT). PolyQ expansion promotes misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT (mHTT) within neurons. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Two decades ago, researchers identified that a CAG expansion mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene was involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, since the identification of the HTT gene, there has been no advance in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or reduce the progression of HD Mutations in the HTT gene , consisting of expansion of CAG triplets , cause the Huntington 's disease ( HD) , one of the major neurodegenerative disorders .  Huntington 's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that is caused by the mutation of the gene which produces a protein called huntingtin ( htt) .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system ( CNS ) that is defined by a CAG expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene leading to the production of mutant huntingtin ( mHtt) .  A mutation in the huntingtin ( Htt ) gene produces mutant Htt and Huntington 's disease ( HD) , a neurodegenerative disorder .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in patients with a mutation in the huntingtin or IT15 gene.  Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expanded stretch of consecutive trinucleotides (cytosine-adenosine-guanine, CAG) within the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4 (p16.3). Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by high instability and extension of CAG sequences within the coding region of IT15 gene. Huntington's disorder (HD), caused by mutations of the IT-15 gene, is an autosomal genetic disease that causes the breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. Positional cloning has shown that the Huntington disease (HD) mutation is an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene.	['HTT gene encoding the protein huntingtin']
5e30e689fbd6abf43b00003a	Which disease is treated with ZMapp?	Gene Transfer of ZMapp Antibodies Mediated by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Protects Against Ebola Infections. Vectored delivery of the ZMapp antibody cocktail (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) by using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) could be useful for preventive immunization against Ebola virus infections because rAAVs can generate long-term antibody expression. ZMapp Reinforces the Airway Mucosal Barrier Against Ebola Virus. Addition of ZMapp, a cocktail of Ebola-binding immunoglobulin G antibodies, effectively reduced mobility of Ebola pseudovirus in the same mucus secretions. Topical delivery of ZMapp to the mouse airways also facilitated rapid elimination of Ebola pseudovirus.  Several strategies have been developed in the past to treat EBOV infection, including the antibody cocktail ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in nonhuman primate models of infection 1 and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans 2  Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.  Only recently have vaccine or drug regimens for the Ebola virus been developed, including Zmapp and peptides.  Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir, favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp).  The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. However, during the recent outbreak, monoclonal antibody cocktails such as ZMapp, ZMAb and MB-003 were either tested in a human clinical safety and efficacy trial or provided to some based on compassionate grounds. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. BACKGROUND  Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). For example, several patients of the present Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa were treated with ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies which are expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . Several patients with Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies , TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA , brincidofovir , and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics . BACKGROUND Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of care alone in patients with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an experimental drug named ZMapp was administered on an emergency basis to seven patients of which five were recovered. BACKGROUND: Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD).

By mammalian one- or two-hybrid experiments in HEK293 cells, we compared transcriptional repression activities of 61 human KRAB-ZNFs Here, using a reporter system, we show that TRIM28/KRAB-ZNFs alter DNA methylation patterns in addition to H3K9me3 to cause stable gene repression during reprogramming. Using several expression datasets, we identified KRAB-ZNFs (ZNF114, ZNF483, ZNF589) in the human genome that maintain pluripotency.   High-resolution mapping on human chromosome 19 revealed that CBX1 coats large domains 0.1-4 Mb in size, which coincide with the position of KRAB-ZNF gene clusters Here, we examine the structural and functional diversity of the 70 human KRAB-ZNF genes involved in the most recent primate SD events including genes that arose in the hominid lineag  Here, we discuss the main evolutionary and molecular features that make transcription factors (TFs), especially the family of zinc finger proteins with a Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB-ZNF), strong candidates to play an important role in postzygotic reproductive isolation The KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger) gene family is composed of a large number of highly homologous genes, gene isoforms, and pseudogenes.

5e30e80bfbd6abf43b00003b	Which molecule is targeted by Asciminib?	Asciminib, an allosteric ABL1 inhibitor, could demonstrate a higher capacity in overcoming common TKIs resistant mutations, including T315I, but clinical findings are needed. Moreover, allosteric targeting has been identified to consequentially inhibit Bcr-Abl activity, which led to the recent development of ABL-001 (asciminib) that selectively binds the myristoyl pocket. Asciminib (previously ABL001), which binds the myristate-binding pocket of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, is in phase I clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib for the treatment of patients with refractory CML or Ph+ ALL.

5cebf83ea49efeb44c00000a	Are male or female persons more prone to autoimmunity?	 Estrogens cause a marked acceleration of autoimmunity and a reduction in thymus weight.  we found that a number of problems or variables arise in studying sex hormone effects, including: 1) X-linked genes, 2) metabolism of testosterone to estrogens, 3) dose of hormone, 4) age at which administration is initiated, 5) differential effects of sex hormones on different autoantibodies and various immune responses. Examples of this autoimmune dimorphism include (but are not limited to) lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis with the two former more prevalent in females than males and the latter more severe during pregnancy. Sex hormones have long been implicated in autoimmune diseases because women account for 80% of cases. Sex hormones have definitive roles in lymphocyte maturation, activation, and synthesis of antibodies and cytokines. Sex hormone expression is altered among patients with autoimmune disease, and this variation of expression contributes to immune dysregulation. ex hormones affect the function of the mammalian immune system, and sex hormone expression is different in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus than in healthy subjects. Sex hormones play a role in the genesis of autoimmunity. Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.  The gut microbiome, which impacts the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, not only influences the development of autoimmune disorders but may interact with sex-hormones to modulate disease progression and sex-bias. Recent studies investigating the origins of sex bias in autoimmune disease have revealed an extensive and interconnected network of genetic, hormonal, microbial, and environmental influences. Investigation of sex hormones has moved beyond profiling the effects of hormones on activity and prevalence of immune cell types to defining the specific immunity-related genes driving these changes	['Female']

These lncRNAs have specific characteristics, such as broader expression domains, that set them apart from other lncRNAs. Fourteen lncRNAs have sequence similarity with the loci of the contemporary homologs of the lost protein-coding genes. We propose that selection acting on enhancer sequences is mostly responsible for retention of these regions. As an example of an RNA element from a protein-coding ancestor that was retained in the lncRNA, we describe in detail a short translated ORF in the JPX lncRNA that was derived from an upstream ORF in a protein-coding gene and retains some of its functionality.CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that ~ 55 annotated conserved human lncRNAs are derived from parts of ancestral protein-coding genes, and loss of coding potential is thus a non-negligible source of new lncRNAs.

The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing.   In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug transporters. In the clinic, a lack of relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions by filgotinib and its active metabolite with substrates of CYP3A4, as well as with organic anion transporters involved in methotrexate elimination were found. Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies. Here we review the pharmacology and clinical trial data for efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an investigational selective JAK1 inhibitor. The selectivity of filgotinib for JAK1 may have theoretical advantages in terms of limiting toxicity.

5e2e136bfbd6abf43b000023	Which portal has been developed to explore protein-protein interactions in cancer cell lines?	The OncoPPi Portal: an integrative resource to explore and prioritize protein-protein interactions for cancer target discovery. As cancer genomics initiatives move toward comprehensive identification of genetic alterations in cancer, attention is now turning to understanding how interactions among these genes lead to the acquisition of tumor hallmarks. Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.Results: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.Availability and implementation: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.Contact: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu.

5c74266a7c78d694710000a2	Which biological process takes place in nuclear speckles?	Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles  In a previous study (Melcák et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mRNA takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of RNA into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of RNA into the speckles.  Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.   Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity. Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity. DNAJC17 is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with splicing machinery components. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells.

5e2b1ed9fbd6abf43b000005	PDQ39 questionnaires is design for which disease?	The outcomes assessed were motor symptoms with Unified PD Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII), functional mobility with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), endurance with 6 min walking test (6MWT), freezing of gait with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG_Q), walking velocity with GAITRite and QL with PD Questionnaire (PDQ39).   They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ).  The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was "mobility."  In the 43% of cases in whom oral therapy was changed, total UPDRS improved significantly (effect size = 8) as did the PDQ39 in cases reaching target. NMS Quest and MOCA scores also improved significantly. This study shows that many people in a representative cohort of PD would benefit from objective assessment and treatment of their PD features against a target. Here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach, diffusion MRI connectometry, to investigate the correlation of quality of life, evaluated by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) with the white matter structural connectivity in 27 non-demented PD patients (disease duration of 5.3 ± 2.9 years, H and Y stage = 1.5 ± 0.6, UPDRS-III = 13.7 ± 6.5, indicating unilateral and mild motor involvement).  The present study aimed to assess the beneficial and side effects of STN DBS in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients. Material and Methods: Thirty five patients underwent bilateral STN DBS from 2008 to 2016 in the Rabat University Hospital. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL). The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (K-NMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)]. METHODS: Static posturography (Centre of Pressure -CoP- parameters), gait (the Ten-Meter Walk Test [TMWT]), freezing of gait (the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire [FOG-Q]), the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and patient-perceived quality of life (the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire [PDQ39]), were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and re-test. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is growing worldwide. Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied. Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep. One hundred thirty patients with PD completed a booklet of questionnaires, which included the PDQ39 as a disease-specific measure of QoL, a symptom checklist, a mobility checklist, as well as patient ratings of disease stage and disability. At 70% sensitivity, the specificity for PDQ39 score and PD Symptoms Questionnaire score for the prediction of parkinsonism was 73.1% and 80.1%, respectively. Workers completed a health status questionnaire (PDQ39) and a Parkinson disease (PD) Symptoms Questionnaire. As for specific questionnaires: the Parkinson`s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) have been described. HRQOL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D and the specific questionnaire Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items.

5e355e20fbd6abf43b000065	Which gene is frequently involved in autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD)?	An LMNB1 Duplication Caused Adult-Onset Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy in Chinese Family: Clinical Manifestations, Neuroradiology and Genetic Diagnosis. Duplication or over expression of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene causes ADLD. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive clinical evaluation and genetic detection for a Chinese family with ADLD. The proband is a 52-year old man manifested with autonomic abnormalities, pyramidal tract dysfunction. MRI brain scan identified bilateral symmetric white matter (WM) hyper-intensities in periventricular and semi-oval WM, cerebral peduncles and middle cerebellar peduncles. The proband has a positive autosomal dominant family history with similar clinical manifestations with a trend of genetic anticipation. In order to understand the genetic cause of the disease in this family, target exome capture based next generation sequencing has been done, but no causative variants or possibly pathogenic variants has been identified. However, Multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) showed whole duplication of LMNB1 gene which is co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family. This is the first genetically confirmed LMNB1 associated ADLD pedigree from China. Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. However, as only a few cases have been analyzed in detail, the mechanisms underlying LMNB1 duplications are unclear. We report the detailed molecular analysis of the largest collection of ADLD families studied, to date. We have identified the minimal duplicated region necessary for the disease, defined all the duplication junctions at the nucleotide level and identified the first inverted LMNB1 duplication. Duplication of the LMNB1 gene is the genetic cause of ADLD, yet the pathogenetic mechanism is not defined. In this study, we analysed cells and muscle tissue from three patients affected by ADLD, carrying an extra copy of the LMNB1 gene. Adult-onset autosomal-dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder characterized by early autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, pyramidal tract and cerebellar dysfunction, and white matter loss in the central nervous system. ADLD is caused by duplication of the LMNB1 gene, which results in increased lamin B1 transcripts and protein expression. How duplication of LMNB1 leads to myelin defects is unknown.  Lamin B1 duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy. ADLD is associated with duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene but the mechanism by which the rearrangement conveys the phenotype is not fully defined. We analyzed four unrelated families segregating ADLD with autonomic symptoms for duplications of the LMNB1 gene. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed novel duplications spanning the entire LMNB1 gene in probands from each of the four families. We then analyzed the expression of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes by Western blot analysis in five patients from two available families. The protein levels of lamin B1 were found significantly increased. These results indicate that the ADLD phenotype associated with LMNB1 duplications is mediated by increased levels of the lamin B1 protein. Furthermore, we show that a molecular diagnosis for ADLD with autonomic symptoms can be obtained by a direct analysis of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes. Genomic duplications mediate overexpression of lamin B1 in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) with autonomic symptoms. Objective  To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 ( __i_tag__ LMNB1 __end_i_tag__ ).

To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ). Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene.  Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder , is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein , lamin B1 , and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene.  As a proof-of-concept , we studied autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) due to lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) duplication , a hereditary , progressive and fatal disorder affecting myelin in the CNS.  We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease.

Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. However, we previously reported an ADLD family (ADLD-1-TO) without evidence of duplication or other mutation in LMNB1 despite linkage to the LMNB1 locus and lamin B1 overexpression. Through parallel studies, we investigated both loss of genetic material and chromosomal rearrangement as possible causes of LMNB1 overexpression, and found that ADLD-1-TO plausibly results from an enhancer adoption mechanism. Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder, is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein, lamin B1, and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene. Objective To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 (LMNB1). ABSTRACT Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Duplications of lamin B1 (LMNB1) at 5q23 are implicated in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) having been described in six families with diverse ethnic background but with a homogeneous phenotype. INTRODUCTION: adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare inherited disorder due to a duplication of lamin-B1 (LMNB1) gene. While at least a dozen disorders are associated with LMNA, the focus of this review is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), the only disease associated with the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1).

5ca61f17ecadf2e73f000050	Which is the main epigenetic difference between poised and constitutive enhancers?	Modifications of histones further lead to repressed, activated or poised gene transcription, thus bringing another level of fine tuning regulation of gene transcription. Embryonic Stem cells (ES cells) recapitulate within embryoid bodies (i.e., cell aggregates) or in 2D culture the early steps of cardiac development  These chromatin domains, mostly constitutive, may have been used as genomic niches where novel regulations could evolve due to both the preexistence of a structural backbone poised to integrate novel regulatory inputs, and a highly adaptive transcriptional readout These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.	['H3K27ac']
5e2f0afcfbd6abf43b000028	Which receptor is inhibited by Tivozanib?	The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis. BACKGROUND: Tivozanib is a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinases.  Tivozanib is a selective inhibitor of all three VEGFRs, with limited off-target interaction, which demonstrates efficacy with improved tolerability relative to multikinase VEGFR-TKIs.

5e2902688b3851296d000005	Which receptor is inhibited by Teprotumumab?	A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug.  Results from a very recently published clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab, an inhibitory human anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody, in active, moderate to severe TAO are extremely encouraging. The induction in fibrocytes is a consequence of increased TNF-α gene promoter activity and is independent of ongoing protein synthesis. It could be attenuated by dexamethasone and the IGF-1 receptor inhibiting antibody, teprotumumab. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody targeting IGF-IR in TAO.  Results of randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of the IGF-1 receptor antibody teprotumumab and the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab are expected shortly.

5e2a046caa19d74431000008	How many different miRNAs can be upregulated by LB-100?	PP2A inhibition from LB100 therapy enhances daunorubicin cytotoxicity in secondary acute myeloid leukemia via miR-181b-1 upregulation.  LB100 profoundly upregulates miR-181b-1, which we show directly binds to the 3' untranslated region of Bcl-2 mRNA leading to its translational inhibition. MiR-181b-1 ectopic overexpression further diminishes Bcl-2 expression leading to suppression of sAML cell growth, and enhancement of DNR cytotoxicity. 	['One']
5e2902e48b3851296d000006	Which disease can be treated with Anifrolumab?	OBJECTIVES: In a post-hoc analysis, we aimed to validate the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) definition as an endpoint in an systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Phase IIb randomised controlled trial (RCT) (MUSE [NCT01438489]) and then utilize LLDAS to discriminate between anifrolumab and placebo CONCLUSIONS: LLDAS attainment represents a clinically meaningful SLE outcome measure, and anifrolumab is associated with more patients who met LLDAS criteria versus placebo.  A post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two Phase IIb trials (sifalimumab; NCT01283139, anifrolumab; NCT01438489) assessed the clinical significance of a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index (SRI(4)) response (Week 52) for 736 patients with moderate to severe SLE disease activity (study entry).  Objectives: To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous anifrolumab, an anti-type I interferon receptor monoclonal antibody in development for SLE, in healthy volunteers. Characterisation of anifrolumab, a fully human anti-interferon receptor antagonist antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Objective: We investigated the mechanistic and pharmacological properties of anifrolumab, a fully human, effector-null, anti-type I interferon (IFN) alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) monoclonal antibody in development for SLE. Conclusions: Anifrolumab potently inhibits type I IFN-dependent signalling, including the type I IFN autoamplification loop, and is a promising therapeutic for patients with SLE and other diseases that exhibit chronic dysfunctional type I IFN signalling. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a polymorphic presentation. The variability in the clinical expression and severity of SLE makes new treatments both essential and challenging to develop. Several biotherapies targeting different pathophysiological pathways have been developed over the past 15 years. The results of Phase II trials were encouraging but rarely borne out by Phase III trials. Recent data, which are discussed in detail in this review, allowed belimumab - a monoclonal antibody against BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) - to become the first biotherapy approved for use in SLE. Other molecules targeting B cells include the two anti-BLyS antibodies tabalumab and blisibimod; atacicept, which targets both BLyS and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand); and the monoclonal antibody to CD22 epratuzumab. The rekindling of interest in the B-cell pathway has also driven new clinical research into rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 with evaluations of new strategies. A new and promising approach is the use of inhibitors of the type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway, of which the most promising is anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 IFN receptor. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab, a type I interferon (IFN) receptor antagonist, in a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CONCLUSION: Anifrolumab substantially reduced disease activity compared with placebo across multiple clinical end points in the patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.

5e2e11a1fbd6abf43b000021	Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?	Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000 live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.	['G380R']
5c74285c7c78d694710000a3	In which cellular compartment do stress granules localize?	Stress granules are non-membranous structures that transiently form in the cytoplasm during cellular stress, where they promote translational repression of non-essential RNAs and modulate cell signaling by sequestering key signal transduction proteins. Here, we show that Rbfox2 is a novel constituent of cytoplasmic stress granules, the translational silencing machinery assembled in response to cellular stress. Stress prompted the formation of cytoplasmic granules in all subjects and in sporadic ALS FUS mislocalization to the cytoplasm. In this study, we firstly have examined this punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs) Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that are formed in cells when stress occurs. Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules. We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress . We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS.  Sequestration of highly expressed mRNAs in cytoplasmic granules, P-bodies, and stress granules enhances cell viability.	['cytoplasm']
5c701f4f7c78d69471000060	Which disease is Dasatinib used to treat?	Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia Our results suggest that the characteristics of complete molecular response on dasatinib treatment may be similar to that achieved with imatinib, at least in patients with adverse disease features. Dasatinib as salvage therapy for steroid refractory and imatinib resistant or intolerant sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. Furthermore, two recent studies showed dasatinib to be effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of cells from leukemia patients with c-Cbl RING finger and linker domain mutations Thus we conclude that dasatinib may not be an appropriate therapy for leukemia patients with c-Cbl mutations  With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. Minimal residual disease-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line dasatinib combined with chemotherapy for adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  We assessed the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line incorporation of dasatinib (100 mg once daily) into chemotherapy alternatively for adults with Ph-positive ALL. This dasatinib-based protocol was effective for achieving a good quality molecular response and durable DFS in adults with Ph-positive ALL NKG2D gene polymorphisms are associated with disease control of chronic myeloid leukemia by dasatinib.

5e2e1792fbd6abf43b000024	Mutations in which gene form the genetic basis of the DOORS syndrome?	We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. More information is needed to understand the cellular roles of TBC1D24 and identify the genes responsible for DOORS phenotypes in individuals who do not have a mutation in TBC1D24. INTERPRETATION  Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. Mutations in another BAF complex gene (SMARCA2) and (TBC1D24) were found to cause clinically similar conditions with ID, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome and DOORS syndrome, respectively.

5e29f6e0aa19d74431000002	Which disease category is LB-100 mostly assessed for?	Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition enhances radiation sensitivity and reduces tumor growth in chordoma. LB100 is a small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A designed to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage from irradiation and chemotherapy. A recently completed phase I trial of LB100 in solid tumors demonstrated its safety. Here, we show the therapeutic potential of LB100 in chordoma Animals implanted with chordoma cells and treated with the combination of LB100 and radiation demonstrated tumor growth delay. Combining LB100 and radiation enhanced DNA damage-induced cell death and delayed tumor growth in an animal model of chordoma. PP2A inhibition by LB100 treatment may improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy for chordoma. PP2A inhibition with LB100 enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity and overcomes cisplatin resistance in medulloblastoma cells. The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, LB100, has been shown in pre-clinical studies to be an effective chemo- and radio-sensitizer for treatment of various cancers. We investigated effects associated with LB100 treatment alone and in combination with cisplatin for medulloblastoma (MB) in vitro and in vivo in an intracranial xenograft model. We demonstrated that LB100 had a potent effect on MB cells. By itself, LB100 inhibited proliferation and induced significant apoptosis in a range of pediatric MB cell lines. It also attenuated MB cell migration, a pre-requirement for invasion.  Finally, LB100 exhibited potent in vivo anti-neoplastic activity in combination with cisplatin in an intracranial xenograft model.

5e2deb35fbd6abf43b00001c	Which method has been developed for mapping of Transcription Start Sites (TSS) starting from nanograms of RNA?	SLIC-CAGE: high-resolution transcription start site mapping using nanogram-levels of total RNA. Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a methodology for genome-wide quantitative mapping of mRNA 5' ends to precisely capture transcription start sites at a single nucleotide resolution. In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 µg), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells.

Here we show that PIWI, an ARGONAUTE/PIWI protein family member that binds to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), strongly and specifically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), a central player in heterochromatic gene silencing. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) positively regulates euchromatic gene expression through RNA transcript association and interaction with hnRNPs in Drosophila. Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) is a well-known conserved protein involved in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in different species including humans. HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins, recognized readers of the heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and chromosome structure. heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). HP1a targets the Drosophila KDM4A demethylase to a subset of heterochromatic genes to regulate H3K36me3 levels. Enrichment of HP1a on Drosophila chromosome 4 genes creates an alternate chromatin structure critical for regulation in this heterochromatic domain. HP1a: a structural chromosomal protein regulating transcription. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a in Drosophila) is a conserved eukaryotic chromosomal protein that is prominently associated with pericentric heterochromatin and mediates the concomitant gene silencing.  Heterochromatin-associated interactions of Drosophila HP1a with dADD1, HIPP1, and repetitive RNAs. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) has conserved roles in gene silencing and heterochromatin and is also implicated in transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Maintenance of Heterochromatin by the Large Subunit of the CAF-1 Replication-Coupled Histone Chaperone Requires Its Interaction with HP1a Through a Conserved Motif. The chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is involved in the assembly of H3-H4 histone dimers on newly synthesized DNA and in the maintenance of a higher order structure, the heterochromatin, through an interaction of its large subunit with the heterochromatin protein HP1a As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc domains.  Finally, we find that HP1a also specifies initiation sites of nuclear envelope reassembly on undamaged chromatin. 	['heterochromatic gene silencing']

SAF-A/hnRNP U is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (MAR) and RNA as a component of hnRNPs.  Scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) participates in the regulation of gene expression by organizing chromatin into transcriptionally active domains and by interacting directly with RNA polymerase II. Functional analyses reveal that dual depletion of SAF-A and BRG1 abolishes global transcription by RNA polymerase II, while the nucleolar RNA polymerase I transcription machinery remains unaffected Using this domain as a probe, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and we found that scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B), a nuclear matrix-associated protein, exhibits protein-protein interaction to this region.

5e48a916d14c9f295d00000f	Which receptor is modulated with Siponimod?	RESULTS: Among a battery of molecules tested, siponimod, a dual agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5, was among the most efficient favoring remyelination. We validated several known promyelinating compounds and demonstrated that the strong remyelinating efficacy of siponimod implicates the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P1 ) modulators provide an emerging therapeutic approach for various autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Fingolimod is the first approved orally active, selective and potent drug of this class. Other drugs belonging to this class include siponimod, ponesimod, ceralifimod, amiselimod, CS-0777 and GSK2018682.  S1P receptor antagonists fingolimod and siponimod do not improve the outcome of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis mice after disease onset. Functional sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) antagonists like fingolimod and siponimod (BAF312) are successfully used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and fingolimod was shown to prevent the development of myasthenic symptoms in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), the standard model of MG. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of the functional S1PR1 antagonist, siponimod, in phase III clinical trials for autoimmune disorders and of the competitive sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1) antagonist, TASP0277308, in pre-clinical development in an in vivo model of TBI in mice.  In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. We assessed the effect of siponimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor1,5 modulator, on disability progression in patients with SPMS. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS.  A high incidence of hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was observed in mice treated for 2 years with siponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) functional antagonist, while no such tumors were observed in rats under the same treatment conditions.  Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. BACKGROUND  Siponimod is an oral selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor types 1 and type 5, with an elimination half-life leading to washout in 7 days. The next-generation sphingosine-1 receptor modulator BAF312 (siponimod) improves cortical network functionality in focal autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. Siponimod, a next-generation selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is currently being investigated for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Siponimod is a newer-generation sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that internalizes S1P1 receptors, thereby inhibiting efflux of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and thymus. Discovery of BAF312 (Siponimod), a Potent and Selective S1P Receptor Modulator.

Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. Siponimod (BAF312) is a synthetic molecule belonging to the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulator family, which has putative neuroprotective properties and well-characterized immunomodulating effects mediated by sequestration of B and T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. INTERPRETATION: Siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression with a safety profile similar to that of other S1P modulators and is likely to be a useful treatment for SPMS. Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S1P modulators commercially available for the treatment of relapsing-remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S1P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S1P3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In this study, we directly compared the electropharmacological profiles of fingolimod with those of siponimod, a modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 and 5, using in vivo guinea-pig model and in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay to better understand the onset mechanisms of the clinically observed adverse events. BAF312 (Siponimod) is a dual agonist at the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors, S1PR1 and S1PR5. BAF312 (siponimod) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, with faster organ/tissue distribution and elimination kinetics than its precursor FTY720 (fingolimod). Siponimod, a selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors type 1 and type 5, demonstrated an excellent safety profile in a large study of patients with multiple sclerosis. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients.	['sphingosine-1-phosphate']

Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1 and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. Identification of STAG1 as a key mediator of a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. The STAG1 gene was one of the transcripts showing higher expression levels in cells infected with Ad-p53-121F as opposed to Ad-wtp53.  the expression of STAG1 mRNA was induced in response to various genotoxic stresses in a p53-dependent manner; moreover, enforced expression of STAG1 led to apoptosis in several additional cancer cell lines. Differential regulation of telomere and centromere cohesion by the Scc3 homologues SA1 and SA2, respectively, in human cells. Here, we show that cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) are differentially required for telomere and centromere cohesion, respectively. These results suggest that at telomeres cohesion relies on the molecular interplay between TRF1 and SA1 to promote DNA-DNA pairing, while along chromosomal arms the core cohesin assembly might also depend on SA1 1D diffusion on DNA and sequence-specific DNA binding.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer cells on its paralog STAG1 In all cases, we observed that the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.  cohesin-SA1 preferentially contributes to the stabilization of topologically associating domain boundaries together with CTCF, whereas cohesin-SA2 promotes cell-type-specific contacts between enhancers and promoters independently of CTCF. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association. A striking finding was the identification of members of the cohesin complex (STAG2, RAD21, STAG1, and SMC3) among the top 20 genes from the screen. Upon individual validation of these cohesin genes, we found that their knockdown led to an immediate expansion of cells with an HSC phenotype in vitro.	['meiosis and cell proliferation']
5e4ada686d0a277941000014	Which method is behind HipMCL?	HipMCL: a high-performance parallel implementation of the Markov clustering algorithm for large-scale networks. Biological networks capture structural or functional properties of relevant entities such as molecules, proteins or genes. Characteristic examples are gene expression networks or protein-protein interaction networks, which hold information about functional affinities or structural similarities. Such networks have been expanding in size due to increasing scale and abundance of biological data. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of ∼70 million nodes with ∼68 billion edges in ∼2.4 h. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks. HipMCL is based on MPI and OpenMP and is freely available under a modified BSD license. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks.

NF-κB and tonic interferon signals are involved in the final maturation of thymocytes into naive T cells. The inhibition of dopamine synthesis in fetuses changes the pattern of T-lymphocyte maturation in the thymus of adult rats.

Effects of nicotine exposure on T cell development in fetal thymus organ culture: arrest of T cell maturation. Furthermore, d-tubocurarine alone blocked the development of both immature and mature murine thymocytes, suggesting the presence of an endogenous ligand that may engage nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on developing thymocytes and influence the course of normal thymic ontogeny. However, both DP T cell subsets have an intrathymic origin since they appear in the recent thymic emigrant population after injection of FITC intrathymically. T-cell maturation in the human thymus and tonsil Expression of the HPV16E7 oncoprotein by thymic epithelium is accompanied by disrupted T cell maturation and a failure of the thymus to involute with age.

5e51dc516d0a27794100003e	Which is the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in Europeans?	Loss-of-function nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans. The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort.METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses. We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

5e3a6e70b5b409ea53000018	What is the target of a drug pidilizumab?	We present results from the first study to evaluate the immune modulating antibody MDV9300 (pidilizumab) in pediatric patients with DIPG.  This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C.  Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers. Recent successes in early Phase I/II trials using anti-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab or pidilizumab directed against PD-1 in the setting of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas validate the therapeutic utility of reversing B cell-mediated immune suppression.  RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have evaluated the prevalence and prognostic implications of PD-1, PD-L1/2 expression in various lymphoma subtypes. We present an overview of the clinical trials evaluating pidilizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab in patients with lymphoid malignancies, and highlight some of the more promising agents in this class, currently in development. BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the risk of elevated transaminases associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors use in patients with cancer.METHODS: Studies eligible for our analysis included randomized Phase II and III trials of patients with cancer on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab and pidilizumab, which describe events of elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]. AIM: We performed a meta-analysis of the risk of selected gastrointestinal toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.PATIENTS & METHODS: Eligible studies included randomized trials of patients with solid tumors on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab, pidilizumab and atezolizumab, describing events of diarrhea, vomiting or colitis.

5e4bf9436d0a27794100002d	Which transcription factor controls Drosophila's Hes genes?	Transcriptional dynamics elicited by a short pulse of notch activation involves feed-forward regulation by E(spl)/Hes genes. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Hes genes are responsible for co-ordinating the Notch response of a wide spectrum of other targets, explaining the critical functions these key regulators play in many developmental and disease contexts. Mammalian Hes genes encode transcriptional factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Notch-Hes1 pathway regulates ovarian somatic cell development, which is necessary for oocyte survival and maturation. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell interaction In this study, we identified the Atrophin family protein RERE (also called Atro2) as a positive regulator of Notch target Hes genes in the developing vertebrate spinal cord HES transcriptional repressors are important components of the Notch pathway that regulates neurogenesis from Drosophila to vertebrates. Notch signaling produces an initial burst of hes5 activity, which represses hes6-2  Transient transfection analyses demonstrated that, while Hes1 and Hes5 promoter activities are significantly upregulated by the active form of Notch, a key regulator of cellular differentiation, Hes2 and Hes3 promoter activities are not. These results suggest that Hes genes are functionally classified into two groups: those that are regulated by Notch and those that are not. hairy and Enhancer of split function in both segmentation and in the Notch neurogenic pathway during Drosophila embryo development. Previous expression data suggested a conserved role for the Hes genes in the Notch signalling pathway, but not in segmentation. These data suggest that Notch signaling through activation of HES transcriptional repressors may play a role in murine placental development. In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which interact with the Groucho protein to shut off achaete-scute transcription.  data from these hyperplasias with chromatin occupancy data for Dpn, a Hes transcription factor, to identify genes regulated by Hes factors in this process. We show that the Notch/He Prdm proto-oncogene transcription factor family expression and interaction with the Notch-Hes pathway in mouse neurogenesis. In Drosophila we recently characterized Hamlet, a transcription factor that mediates Notch signalling and neural cell fate. HESR1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors regulated by the Notch signaling pathway in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos, and is related to the HES/Hairy/E (sp1) family. H Hairy-related transcription factor (HRT/Hey) genes encode a novel subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors related to the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split (E(spl)) and the mammalian HES proteins that function as downstream mediators of Notch signaling. Usin t has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that Delta-dependent Notch signaling activates the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, leading to an increased expression of the Enhancer of Split genes.  Here we analyze genome-wide changes in transcript levels, binding of the Notch pathway transcription factor, CSL [Suppressor of Hairless, Su(H), in Drosophila], and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) immediately following a short pulse of Notch stimulation. Other genes had a more delayed response, the timing of which was largely unaffected by more prolonged Notch activation. Hes and Hey genes are the mammalian counterparts of the Hairy and Enhancer-of-split type of genes in Drosophila and they represent the primary targets of the Delta-Notch signaling pathway. We show that the Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes. Furthermore, we observed that Dl-1-induced HES-1 transactivation was dependent both on Kuzbanian and RBP-J activities, consistent with the involvement of these two proteins in Notch signaling in Drosophila.

5e61425e1af46fc13000000d	Roughly how many base pairs are in the human mitochondrial genome or mtDNA?	The 16569 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA  BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are increasingly being recognized in many human cancers, but automated sequencing of 16.5 kb of DNA poses an onerous task. The human mitochondrial genome consists of a multicopy, circular dsDNA molecule of 16,569 base pairs. In addition to the 3 billion base pair nuclear genome, each human cell contains thousands of copies of a small, 16.5 kb circular molecule of double stranded DNA: mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) which generally accounts for only 1% of the total cellular nucleic acid content. The ntrast, human cells contain hundreds to thousands of copies of a ca.16 kB mtDNA genome tightly packed with 13 protein-coding genes along with rRNA and tRNA genes required for their expression. The  Human mitochondria harbor an essential, high copy number, 16,569 base pair, circular DNA genome that encodes 13 gene products required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. M The small (16,569 base pair) human mitochondrial genome plays a significant role in cell metabolism and homeostasis. Human mitochondria harbor an essential, high copy number, 16,569 base pair, circular DNA genome that encodes 13 gene products required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a circular double-stranded DNA genome of ~16.5 kilobase pairs (kb) that encodes 13 catalytic proteins of the ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), and the rRNAs and tRNAs required for the translation of the mtDNA transcripts. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a circular, double-stranded, 16,569-base paired DNA containing 37 genes: 13 proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs; 12S and 16S), and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The mitochondrial genome of humans and most vertebrates is approximately 16.5kbp, double-stranded, circular, with few non-coding bases. In humans, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a 16,569-bp double-stranded circular molecule, encoding 37 genes, and is exclusively transmitted from the mother. They are maternally inherited and in humans contain a 16,569-base-pair circular genome (mtDNA) encoding 37 genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from single base pair changes in the 16.5 kilobase pair genome up to large deletions and rearrangements. In contrast, human cells contain hundreds to thousands of copies of a ca.16 kB mtDNA genome tightly packed with 13 protein-coding genes along with rRNA and tRNA genes required for their expression. For comprehensive mutation scanning of the whole 16.569 bp human mitochondrial genome, we developed a set of 67 primer pairs defining overlapping PCR fragments that are well suited for heteroduplex analysis. Human mitochondrial DNA, the 25th chromosome, is a 16 569 base pair long circular molecule, that encoders a variety of genes for the translational machinery of the mitochondrion, as well as 13 structural proteins, that are all subunits of the respiratory chain (RC). Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from single base changes in the 16.5 kilobase-pair genome up to large deletions and rearrangements.	['16569 bps']

5fe30e06a43ad31278000037	Which histone mark distinguishes active from inactive enhancers?	We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300.  This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an "active enhancer landscape" and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. rthermore, like H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K14ac can also differentiate active enhancers from inactive ones. A  observation suggests that histone acetyl transferases (HATs) prime inactive genes by H3K14ac for stimuli dependent activation.

601d2d001cb411341a00002c	Which syndrome is caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein?	Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability. Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome Our report of variant in ARMC9 Leading to Joubert syndrome phenotype (JS30), elucidates the genetic heterogeneity of Joubert syndrome, and expands the gene list for ciliopathies.

5fd0d880a43ad31278000002	Which type of pluripotency is Otx2 associated with?	Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation.  The transcription factor Otx2 acts as a negative switch in the regulation of transition from naive to primed pluripotency in mouse pluripotent stem cells. These observations indicate that OTX2 and NANOG can form a negative feedback circuitry to regulate the pluripotency of porcine iPS cells. Jδ retained the pluripotency gene-inducing ability of Sδ when used alone and in combination with Sδ; a notable increase in the pluripotency gene expression was observed. Interestingly, Jδ significantly induced the expression of HDAC8-controlled Otx2 and Lhx1. Otx2 is an intrinsic determinant of the embryonic stem cell state and is required for transition to a stable epiblast stem cell condition. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, Otx2 is required for ESC transition into EpiSCs and, subsequently, to stabilize the EpiSC state by suppressing, in pluripotent cells, the mesendoderm-to-neural fate switch in cooperation with BMP4 and Fgf2. We propose that Otx2 is a novel intrinsic determinant controlling the functional integrity of ESCs and EpiSCs. Pig iPSCs, which lacked expression of specific naïve state markers KLF2/4/5 and TBX3, but expressed the primed state markers of Otx2 and Fabp7, share defining features with human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs.  Here we show that OTX2 is highly expressed at the onset of rosette formation, when rosettes comprise no more than 3-5 cells, and that its expression precedes that of established markers of early neuronal differentiation.  Otx2 and Oct4 drive early enhancer activation during embryonic stem cell transition from naive pluripotency. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 directly stimulated the expression of OTX2, RX1 and SIX3 in HDFs and iPSCs.  A key factor in this process is Otx2, which is upregulated during the early stages of this transition and ultimately recruits Oct4 to a different set of enhancers Induction of Otx2 causes the reorganization of acetylated Oct4 and results in the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Regulation of Oct4 by SirT1 may link stem cell development to environmental conditions, and it may provide strategies to manipulate epiblast cell state. In hESCs, ZNF207 partners with master pluripotency TFs to govern self-renewal and pluripotency while simultaneously controlling commitment of cells towards ectoderm through direct regulation of neuronal TFs, including OTX2.   Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts.  We observed that the expression of Lin28 genes is transiently induced soon after the exit of ESCs from the naive ground state and that this induction is due to the Hmga2-dependent engagement of Otx2 with enhancers present at both Lin28 gene loci. Functional Antagonism between OTX2 and NANOG Specifies a Spectrum of Heterogeneous Identities in Embryonic Stem Cells Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Our results illuminate regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency and suggest that the capacity of transcription factors such as Otx2 and Oct4 to pioneer new enhancer sites is highly context dependent. Taken together, our results establish readily efficient and safe protocols to produce iPSCs and iPSC-derived RPE cells, and underline that the reactivation of anterior neural transcription factor OTX2, eye field transcription factor RX1 and SIX3 in iPSCs is a feature of pluripotency acquisition and predetermines the potential of RPE differentiation. In summary, this study demonstrates that there is a regulatory network mediated by miR-1343, in which downregulation of OTX2 by miR-1343 can elevate the expression of pluripotent genes that were then sustain the pluripotency of piPSCs. Molecular network of miR-1343 regulates the pluripotency of porcine pluripotent stem cells via repressing OTX2 expression. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Importantly, the rise of OTX2 expression in these cells coincides with the down-regulation of the pluripotency marker OCT4. cESCs propagated in 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naïve pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). The transcription factor Otx2 acts as a negative switch in the regulation of transition from naive to primed pluripotency in mouse pluripotent stem cells n 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naïve pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). Differential phosphoryla h core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency.

The distinct r present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network. Genome- Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency.

5fe08b50a43ad31278000031	How many DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS) mark the murine beta globin locus region?	Mammalian beta-globin loci are composed of multiple orthologous genes whose expression is erythroid specific and developmentally regulated. The expression of these genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR). The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals. The LCR encompasses 6 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) that bind transcription factors.  Globin gene expression is regulated, in part, by the locus control region, which physically consists of five DNaseI-hypersensitive sites located 6-22 Kb upstream of the epsilon -globin gene. he LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. These HSs are conserved among mammals, bind transcription factors that also bind to other parts of the locus, and compose the functional components of the LCR.  n addition, we have identified DNaseI-hypersensitive sites within the newly sequenced regions in both mouse and human, and these structural features also are conserved. The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) consists of four erythroid-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) at the 5' end of the beta-globin cluster.  The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is contained on a 20 kb DNA fragment and is characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitive sites in erythroid cells, termed 5'HS1-5.  In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The results show that at least three of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number dependent expression.  Targeted deletion of 5'HS1 and 5'HS4 of the beta-globin locus control region reveals additive activity of the DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is contained on a 20 kb DNA fragment and is characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitive sites in erythroid cells, termed 5'HS1-5.

The locus control region of the beta-globin cluster contains five DNase I hypersensitive sites (5'HS1-5) required for locus activation.

Exome sequencing was performed to identify novel genes in a cohort of 99 pediatric and 134 adult-onset group I PAH patients. Novel rare variants in the gene identified were independently identified in a cohort of 680 adult-onset patients. Variants were expressed in COS cells and function assessed by patch-clamp and rubidium flux analysis.RESULTS: We identified a de novo novel heterozygous predicted deleterious missense variant c.G2873A (p.R958H) in ABCC8 in a child with idiopathic PAH. We then evaluated all individuals in the original and a second cohort for rare or novel variants in ABCC8 and identified 11 additional heterozygous predicted damaging ABCC8 variants. ABCC8 encodes SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1)-a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We observed loss of ATP-sensitive potassium channel function for all ABCC8 variants evaluated and pharmacological rescue of all channel currents in vitro by the SUR1 activator, diazoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare missense variants in ABCC8 are associated with PAH. Identified ABCC8 mutations decreased ATP-sensitive potassium channel function, which was pharmacologically recovered.	['c.G2873A', 'p.R958H']

The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined Hereditary hemochromatosis: HFE mutation analysis in Greeks reveals genetic heterogeneity Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians; reported disease frequencies vary from 0.3 to 0.8%. Identification of a candidate HFE gene in 1996 was soon followed by the description of two ancestral mutations The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in South Africa in order to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder.DESIGN: DNA samples of patient and control groups were screened for two common haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. High prevalence of the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation facilitates an improved diagnostic service for hereditary haemochromatosis in South Africa mutations of HFE, which is a candidate gene for hemochromatosis, Our data do not confirm an association of PCT with the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation, strongly associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European countries Haploinsufficiency of HFE may be one possible explanation for hemochromatosis in this patient. Geographic and racial/ethnic differences in HFE mutation frequencies in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Status of HFE mutation in thalassemia syndromes in north India Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive and most commonly inherited single gene disorder among Caucasians, with a prevalence of 5 per 1,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 10. Two point mutations were described and are referred as C282Y and H63D hereditary hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE These results suggest that lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage, and that this capacity is somehow related to the presence of the C282Y HFE mutation. Compared to previous studies, we show that HFE mutation can possess the risk of AD in transferrin-, APOE- and APP-normal patients. Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin-receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin, hepcidin, or ferroportin genes. Genotyping of hemochromatosis-associated mutations in the HFE gene by PCR-RFLP and a novel reverse hybridization method. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common condition caused by HFE gene mutations, can lead to excess iron storage and disease but clinical penetrance of HFE gene mutations is low and many people with elevated iron stores lack HFE mutations. The three main mutations in gene HFE (C282Y, H63D, S65C) are the cause of development of 97% of cases of inherent hemochromatosis. Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. He Genetic iron overload, or hemochromatosis, can be caused by mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin, and hepcidin genes. He Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). W The mechanism of excessive iron storage in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis caused by mutations of the HFE gene seems to be a failure to up-regulate hepcidin in the face of increased body iron ith the common disease hereditary hemochromatosis, which is often caused by an HFE mutation, may have retinal iron overload predisposing to AMD. Preliminary data  oxylase. New speculations have appeared on the possible relation of this role of iron and the occurrence of mutation of the recently discovered gene of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE, which may cause the iron overloading of the  Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least five different genes (HFE, HJV, TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP) involved in the production or activity of the liver hormone hepcidin, a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Neverth Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A.  The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.-20G>A and c.718A>G (p.K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively. There are 2 main causes of iron overload: hereditary hemochromatosis which is a primary cause, is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations of genes that control iron metabolism and secondary hemochromatosis caused by multitransfusions, chronic hemolysis, and intake of iron rich food. Less common non-HFE-related forms of hemochromatosis have been reported and are caused by mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 gene and in a gene localized to chromosome 1q. Most types of genetic hemochromatosis are due to mutations in the HFE gene, although similar iron overload and organ damage can also result from mutations in genes other than HFE in rare types of hemochromatosis. Mutations in HFE are the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Furthermore, these results suggest that natural genetic variation in the human ortholog TMPRSS6 might modify the clinical penetrance of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis, raising the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of TMPRSS6 could attenuate iron loading in this disorder. The hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE promotes the expression of hepcidin, a circulating hormone produced by the liver that inhibits dietary iron absorption and macrophage iron release. Mutations in the Hfe gene are associated with the iron overload disease, hemochromatosis. It is known that about 85% of patients with inherent hemochromatosis are either homo-zygotic agents of mutation C282Y or carry compound-heterozygote C282Y/H63D. Therefore, the molecular genetic study intended for detection of these three mutations in gene HFE takes important place in diagnostic of inherent hemochromatosis. [The comparison of three molecular genetic techniques for identifying major mutations in gene HFE related to development of inherent hemochromatosis.] The most common type of hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by HFE gene mutation. HFE participates in the regulation of iron metabolism, its mutations are primary cause of hereditary hemochromatosis and appear to be more frequent in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetic hemochromatosis now corresponds to six diseases, namely classical hemochromatosis HFE 1; juvenile hemochromatosis HFE 2 due to mutations in an unidentified gene on chromosome 1; hemochromatosis HFE 3 due to mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2); hemochromatosis HFE 4 caused by a mutation in the H subunit of ferritin; and hemochromatosis HFE 6 whose gene is hepcidine (HAMP). Mutations in HFE causing hemochromatosis are associated with primary hypertriglyceridemia. factors. Elevated iron storage is associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity, and all of them are associated with HTG.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze whether HFE mutations causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are associated with primary HTG.DESIGN: Genetic predisposition to HH was analyzed in a case-control study.SETTING: The study was conducted at University Hospital Lipid Clinic.PARTICIPANTS: We studied two groups: 1) the HTG group, composed of 208 patients; and 2) the control group, composed of 215 normolipemic subjects and 161 familial hypercholesterolemia patients.INTERVENTION: Two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We measured HH genetic predisposition difference between groups.RESULTS: HH genetic predisposition was 5.9 and 4.4 times highe	['Hemochromatosis', 'haemochromatosis', 'Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)']
5fdb4392a43ad3127800002a	Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?	TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) In this review we will discuss the role of the X chromosome encoded toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the development of autoimmunity. X-Chromosome complement and estrogen receptor signaling independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α production of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from women. Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α response of pDCs in women. The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7.  Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. By genome scanning, evidence of linkage between chromosome Xp22 and asthma and related atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8 genes. Since the TLR7 gene is localized on the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was analyzed separately in males and females.  TLR7 (located on the X chromosome) Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well as the incidence of lupus nephritis. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. TLR7 escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. Here, we report that B cells containing the Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus are intrinsically biased toward nucleolar antigens because of increased expression of TLR7, a single-stranded RNA-binding innate immune receptor. The TLR7 gene is duplicated in Yaa mice because of a 4-Megabase expansion of the pseudoautosomal region.	['chromosomeX']

601eafcd1cb411341a000056	Which deep learning framework has been developed for cancer molecular subtype classification?	DeepCC: a novel deep learning-based framework for cancer molecular subtype classification. Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity. Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.

601eab7d1cb411341a000053	What class of drugs have been given a black box warning for suicide?	The FDA "Black Box" Warning on Antidepressant Suicide Risk in Young Adults: More Harm Than Benefit The decision made in the year 2004 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require a boxed warning on antidepressants regarding the risk of suicidality in young adults   However, within the past decade, an increasing number of reports have questioned the actual validity of the FDA warning, especially considering a decline in the prescription of the antidepressant drugs associated with an increase in the rate of suicidal events among people with severe depression . In 2004, the European and American authorities released a black-box warning on antidepressants indicating an association with an increased risk of suicidality (suicidal ideation and behavior) in young people In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) controversially issued a black box warning that antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours in people aged under 18 years.  The United States Food and Drug Administration issued a Black Box warning in October 2004 after placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medications found an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among children and adolescents taking antidepressant medications relative to placebo. Subsequently, some researchers have concluded that the Black Box warning caused severe unintended consequences; specifically, they have argued that the warning led to reduced use of antidepressants among youth, which led to more suicides OBJECTIVE: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne, carries a black box warning related to the risk of depression, suicide, and psychosis. There has been a decrease in the use of antidepressant therapy in children and adolescents following the US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for risk of suicide. This study evaluates changes in use of antidepressants in children and adolescents after the US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for increased risk of suicide.Method. Subsequently, some researchers have concluded that the Black Box warning caused severe unintended consequences; specifically, they have argued that the warning led to reduced use of antidepressants among youth, which led to more suicides. The FDA "Black Box" Warning on Antidepressant Suicide Risk in Young Adults: More Harm Than Benefits? On July 10, 2008, a Food and Drug Administration scientific advisory committee voted that, yes, there was a significant positive association between AEDs and suicidality but voted against placing a black box warning on AEDs for suicidality. Duty to Warn: Antidepressant Black Box Suicidality Warning Is Empirically Justified. Food and Drug Administration has recently introduced the so-called "black box" on antidepressants' packages with the aim of gaining attention to the possible risk of suicide among adolescents who are treated with antidepressants, with a warning that the risk of suicide is higher when starting a therapy or while adjusting its dosage. OBJECTIVE: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne, carries a black box warning related to the risk of depression, suicide, and psycho In 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a "black-box" warning for antidepressants in children and adolescents, stating that these drugs may increase suicidality, a term encompassing both suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in the first few weeks of treatment. The US FDA has required that antidepressants carry a black box warning that there may be a risk of suicidal ideations in depressed pediatric patients treated with these medications, and recently extended the warning to include individuals up age 24. OBJECTIVES: To study prescribing trends for antidepressants in Hawai'i following the FDA black box warning regarding the possible risk of suicide in children and adolescents. The FDA recently linked adverse event reports of suicidal ideation among children and adolescents in randomized controlled trials to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and consequently required a change in labeling that included a black box warning regarding SSRI use for all age groups. Another hurdle faced by new drugs is the requirement that all antidepressants carry a black-box warning regarding the increased risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults, which limits their use in this population. The quality of studies regarding the psychopharmacological therapy of depressive disorders in childhood and adolescence has improved since the «black box» warning of the FDA concerning the occurrence of suicidality under treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The decision made in the year 2004 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require a boxed warning on antidepressants regarding the risk of suicidality in young adults still represents a matter of controversy. To study prescribing trends for antidepressants in Hawai'i following the FDA black box warning regarding the possible risk of suicide in children and adolescents. Regulatory agencies of different European countries and the United States have been critically examining the possible link between suicidality and antidepressant use in children and adults, which has resulted in an FDA directive to the manufacturers of all antidepressant medications to add a 'black box' warning.

An ultrasound evaluation of the carpal tunnel can assess for pathologic changes of the median nerve, detect secondary causes of CTS, and aid in surgical planning. Carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which median nerve compression results in paresthesias and pain in the wrist and hand. All patients underwent ultrasound with measurement of the surface of the median nerve at the entrance of the carpal tunnel and electroneuromyographic examination of both wrists. Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction of the hand. BACKGROUND: Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction of the hand. SION: Open carpel tunnel release surgery is an effective procedure for compression neuropathy of the median nerve. It sh Carpel tunnel release surgery (CTRS) was performed and in the stimulation group of patients, stainless steel electrode wires placed alongside the median nerve proximal to the surgical decompression site for immediate 1 h 20 Hz bipolar ES. BACKGROUND: Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction  Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve  Carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which median nerve compression results in paresthesias and pain in the wrist and hand.  nslated these findings to human patients by examining the number of reinnervated motor units in the median nerve-innervated thenar muscles before and after carpel tunnel release surgery in a randomized controlled trial. Moto tunnel release surgery (CTRS) was performed and in the stimulation group of patients, stainless steel electrode wires placed alongside the median nerve proximal to the surgical decompression site for immediate 1 h 20 Hz bipolar ES. Subjects OBJECTIVES: To provide a quantitative analysis of ultrasonographic measurements and possible pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome by comparing cross-sectional areas of the median nerve, carpal tunnel, and nerve/tunnel index and the difference in ultrasonographic findings between affected and nonaffected hands and between sexes. We studied the SSR evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve and recording from the contralateral hands in 30 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) without clinical autonomic signs and compared the results to the SSR in 30 normal controls. This pattern is consistent with compression of both the anterior and posterior aspects of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel because nerve fibers responsible for thenar, lumbrical, and digit 2 functions lie in an anterior-posterior gradient within the distal median nerve. RESULTS: Comparison between normative (n=24) and abnormal hands (n=78) revealed the following: the mean proximal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve, carpal tunnel, and nerve/tunnel index of electrodiagnostically normative hands were 10.941mm(2), 192.43mm(2), and 5.635%, respectively, whereas those of abnormal hands were 13.74mm(2), 208.87mm(2), and 6.693%, respectively, showing statistically significant differences for all (P<.05) Sympathetic vasomotor fibres of the median nerve are affected in carpal tunnel syndrome.

601f105e1cb411341a000071	Herpes viruses have what type of genome?	Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 are nuclear-replicating viruses composed of a double-stranded DNA genome  Vectors derived from herpes simplex virus provide a means of gene delivery to postmitotic neurons. The virus is readily taken up at nerve terminals, passes by rapid retrograde and anterograde transport within neurons, and is selectively transferred across synapses, thus allowing it entry from the periphery into the brain. This virus can enter a state of latency in some neurons, where it exists as an episomal element in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active to a reduced extent. In this state, the virus is apparently benign and can effect stable expression of foreign genes. The large (150 kb) genome of this double-stranded virus has been completely sequenced The Herpesviridae are a family of viruses which have a large genome of linear, double-stranded DNA (> 120 kb) Herpesviruses have large double-stranded linear DNA genomes that are formed by site-specific cleavage from complex concatemeric intermediates.  BACKGROUND: Herpes Simplex virus types 1 and 2 are enveloped viruses with a linear dsDNA genome of approximatel Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus with the largest genome (~235 kb) of the known human herpes viruses. Th quence-independent nuclear innate sensor ALR, recognizes episomal dsDNA genomes of herpes viruses such as KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1 in the infected cell nuclei, forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase1, and relocates into the cytoplasm leading into Caspase-1 and IL-1β generation. IFI16 also indu For many years, the generally accepted model for the replication of the double-stranded DNA genome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) incorporated initial circularization of linear molecules in the cell nucleus. Herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are doublestranded DNA viruses with a genome size of 152 kbp. Herpes simplex virus has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with directly repeated terminal sequences needed for cleavage and packaging of replicated DNA. Like all herpes viruses, the virus has a large double-stranded DNA genome within an icosahedral nucleocapsid. Herpesviruses are large double stranded DNA animal viruses with the distinguishing ability to establish latent, life-long infections.	['double stranded DNA']
6020b2b21cb411341a000086	Which cancer can be treated with Darolutamide?	Lately the development of 3 novel second-generation androgen receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) chanced the treatment landscape of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  CONCLUSION: Our outcomes support equivalent efficacy and similar risk of adverse effects between apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide, supporting the use of these antiandrogen agents in high-risk of progression nmCRPC. Furthermore, the combination of BAY 1895344 with the novel, nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide resulted in significantly improved antitumor efficacy compared with respective single-agent treatments in hormone-dependent prostate cancer, and addition of EBRT resulted in even further enhanced antitumor efficacy.  The antiandrogen therapeutics apalutamide and darolutamide entered the clinic in 2018 and 2019, respectively, for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  This has been further verified by the recent FDA approval of the other two second-generation AR antagonists, apalutamide and darolutamide, for the treatment of prostate cancer.  The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer.  BACKGROUND: Darolutamide is recently approved for the treatment of non-metastatic castrate resistance prostate cancer.  Multiple agents including abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T have been approved for advanced prostate cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: NSAAs improve survival in high-risk nmCRPC. Apalutamide and enzalutamide may result in improved oncologic outcomes. Darolutamide may result in fewer AEs. Phase IV data are needed to validate these findings. Darolutamide for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, a structurally distinct androgen receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), has been shown to increase metastasis-free survival among men with nmCRPC compared with placebo.  Budget impact analysis of darolutamide for treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist with a distinct molecular structure, significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival versus placebo in the phase III ARAMIS study in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). BACKGROUND: Darolutamide is a structurally distinct androgen-receptor inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide in Nonmetastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, an oral androgen receptor inhibitor, has been approved for treating nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), based on significant improvements in metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the ARAMIS clinical t Based on positive results in the phase III ARAMIS trial, darolutamide was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we evaluate the activity of darolutamide in enzalutamide-resistant castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as well as in AR mutants detected in patients after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, a structurally distinct androgen receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), has been shown to increase metastasis-free survival among men with nmCRPC compared with placebo. For non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, recent phase III placebo-controlled trials with enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide all demonstrated benefits in improving metastasis-free survival. Darolutamide For Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. The results of a recent randomised phase 3 clinical trial show that the androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide improves metastasis-free survival in men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, compared with placebo.  Comparative efficacy of apalutamide darolutamide and enzalutamide for treatment of non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Studies using apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide have shown improved metastasis free survival (MFS) rates, leaving clinicians with a dilemma of choosing one over the other, for nonmetastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer (nmCRPC). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Darolutamide is a novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonist approved for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  Apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Apalutamide and enzalutamide appear to be more efficacious agents for therapy of nmCRPC, while darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile.  Darolutamide: A Review in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.  In the pivotal multinational, phase 3 ARAMIS trial in men with nmCRPC, relative to placebo plus ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), darolutamide (+ ADT) significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival (MFS) at the time of the primary analysis and overall survival (OS) at the time of the final OS analysis and was generally well tolerated in extended follow-up.  The phase III ARAMIS study shows that the androgen-receptor antagonist darolutamide delays metastasis in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer by a median of 22 months compared with a placebo. Since 2018, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide have been approved for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC). Apalutamide, enzalutamide, and most recently, darolutamide (novel androgen receptor antagonists) have been approved for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).

6027f8ae1cb411341a0000ed	Which network analysis method can you use for prioritization of metabolic disease genes?	metPropagate: network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes. Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis is imperative. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 11 patients with both CNS and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of UM data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We valida metPropagate: network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization.

6030fe7a1cb411341a000128	Which class of disorders are caused by AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit defects?	AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit defects are a cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits encoded by GRIA1-4 genes. GluA2 has an especially important role because, following post-transcriptional editing at the Q607 site, it renders heteromultimeric AMPARs Ca2+-impermeable, with a linear relationship between current and trans-membrane voltage. Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels. When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification. Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

6057c78994d57fd879000034	Which protein is involved in the organization and regulation of pluripotency-associated three-dimensional enhancer networks?	KLF4 is involved in the organization and regulation of pluripotency-associated three-dimensional enhancer networks. Cell fate transitions are accompanied by global transcriptional, epigenetic and topological changes driven by transcription factors, as is exemplified by reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells through the expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and cMYC. How transcription factors orchestrate the complex molecular changes around their target gene loci remains incompletely understood. Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes.

A Susceptibility Locus on Chromosome 13 Profoundly Impacts the Stability of Genomic Imprinting in Mouse Pluripotent Stem Cells. Cultured pluripotent cells accumulate detrimental chromatin alterations, including DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes known as loss of imprinting (LOI). Although the occurrence of LOI is considered a stochastic phenomenon, here we document a genetic determinant that segregates mouse pluripotent cells into stable and unstable cell lines. Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Our observations identify a strong genetic determinant of locus-specific chromatin abnormalities in pluripotent cells and provide a non-invasive way to suppress them.

Identification of KMT2D and KDM6A variants by targeted sequencing from patients with Kabuki syndrome and other congenital disorders. Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facies, postnatal growth deficiency, cardiac defects and skeletal anomalies. Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes are the major causes of KS. Pathogenic variants in KMT2D, which encodes lysine specific methyltransferase 2D, cause autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome, associated with distinctive dysmorphic features including arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lower lid, large protuberant ears, and fetal finger pads We describe here four patients (including one previously published patient) with de novo KMT2D missense variants and with shared but unusual clinical findings not typically seen in Kabuki syndrome These findings significantly expand the phenotypic spectrum of features associated with variants in KMT2D beyond those seen in Kabuki syndrome and suggest a possible new underlying disease mechanism for these patients. Kabuki syndrome is characterized by a variable degree of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, and complications in various organs. Many variants have been identified in two causative genes, that is, lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A) Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder.  Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1).  Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). BACKGROUND: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is commonly caused by mutations in the histone-modifying enzyme lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D). JECTIVE: We sought to characterize the humoral immune defects found in patients with KS with lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations.ME LTS: We report frequent mutations in the lysine methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D) (also known as MLL2), a key regulator of transcriptional enhancer function.

We  Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7LOF) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2DLOF), respectively. Although these two syndromes are clinically ONS: In patients with KS, autosomal dominant KMT2D mutations are associated with dysregulation of terminal B-cell differentiation, leading to humoral immune deficiency and, in some cases, autoimmunity. All pat MT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT  KS was confirmed by genetic testing, which revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 16 of KMT2D (c.4485C>A, Tyr1495Ter). To the best of our Pathogenic variants in KMT2D, which encodes lysine specific methyltransferase 2D, cause autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome, associated with distinctive dysmorphic features including arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lower lid, large protuberant ears, and fetal finger pads. We describe here four patients (including one previously published patient) with de novo KMT2D missense variants and with shared but unusual clinical findings not typically seen in Kabuki syndrome, including athelia (absent nipples), choanal atresia, hypoparathyroidism, delayed or absent pubertal development, and extreme short stature. KMT2D, which encodes a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, has been implicated in human congenital heart disease in the context of Kabuki syndrome. Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder. Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. e sought to characterize the humoral immune defects found in patients with KS with lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations.ME atients with KS, autosomal dominant KMT2D mutations are associated with dysregulation of terminal B-cell differentiation, leading to humoral immune deficiency and, in some cases, autoimmunity. All Mutations in the KMT2D gene, which encodes a H3K4 histone methyltransferase, are the major cause of Kabuki syndrome. The major cause of Kabuki syndrome are mutations in KMT2D, a gene encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase belonging to the group of chromatin modifiers. Mutations with a loss-of-function in the KMT2D gene on chromosome 12 in humans are responsible for Kabuki syndrome (KS). rt defects.

602967de1cb411341a000113	How many nucleotides long is the HOTAIR CNE?	HOTAIR was proposed to regulate either HoxD cluster genes in trans or HoxC cluster genes in cis, a mechanism that remains unclear. We have identified a 32-nucleotide conserved noncoding element (CNE) as HOTAIR ancient sequence that likely originated at the root of vertebrate. The second round of whole-genome duplication resulted in one copy of the CNE within HOTAIR and another copy embedded in noncoding transcript of HOXD11. Paralogous CNEs underwent compensatory mutations, exhibit sequence complementarity with respect to transcripts directionality, and have high affinity in vitro. The HOTAIR CNE resembled a poised enhancer in stem cells and an active enhancer in HOTAIR-expressing cells. HOTAIR expression is positively correlated with HOXC11 in cis and negatively correlated with HOXD11 in trans. 	['32']

Over the last decade, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has increased significantly xtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an increasingly prevalent treatment for acute respiratory failure (ARF).  Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used in cases of severe respiratory and/or circulatory failure over periods of several days to several weeks INTRODUCTION: Mortality of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains high. BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of long-term cardiopulmonary bypass used to treat infants, children, and adults with respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite maximal medical therapy. PURPOSE: Optimal timing of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains controversial. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a support modality used within the pediatric cardiac ICU population as a bridge to recovery or decision in the setting of acute myocardial decompensation, support for combined cardiopulmonary failure or in the setting of refractory cardiopulmonary arrest. Pati OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a widely used technique for treating postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS); however, no study has compared the long-term outcomes of patients who receive ECMO support for PCS with those of the general population post cardiac su Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a kind of technique that uses extracorporeal circulation system to draw patients' blood into the circuit, and then oxygenate the blood when it passes along the membrane, followed by returning the blood into patients. At pr FINDINGS: Major technological improvements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines and the positive results of the conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR) trial have reignited interest in VV-ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent hypoxemia or hypercarbia on conventional mechanical ventilation. BACKGROUND: The use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the adult patient has increased slowly since the first reported successful treatment in 1972 (Hill et al., 1972) and is seen increasingly as a successful therapy when conventional medical treatment has failed.

OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving system used for critically ill patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in adults is rapidly increasing in its use for both cardiac and respiratory failure. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial.

5fe3131ba43ad31278000047	Which RNA polymerase transcribes enhancer RNAs?	Remarkably, we found that in response to E2 TDG localized to enhancers which also recruit ERα, RNA Pol II and other coregulators and which are marked by histone modifications indicative of active enhancers The enhancer produced an eRNA, termed AS1eRNA, that enhanced DHRS4-AS1 transcription by mediating the spatial interactions of the enhancer and DHRS4-AS1 promoter in cooperation with RNA polymerase II and p300/CBP. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a group of lncRNAs transcribed from enhancers, whose regulatory effects on gene expression are an emerging area of interest. The expression of genes targeted by transcribing enhancer is positively correlated with eRNA expression and significantly higher than expression of genes targeted by non-transcribing enhancers. This result implies eRNA transcription indicates a state of enhancer that further increases gene expression. In the light of these results it was surprising to find that the 5' flanking region of a mouse U6 RNA gene includes a perfect copy of the octamer sequence motif, ATTTGCAT, found in many RNA polymerase II transcription enhancer elements. Since transcription of these aberrant RNAs is stimulated by the addition of a murine sarcoma virus enhancer segment, they are probably transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Recent studies have shown that active enhancers recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and are transcribed, producing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Inspection of X. tropicalis, mouse and human U6 DNA upstream sequences revealed the presence of a TATA box as well as of the proximal and enhancer (octamer motif) elements contained in snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. ancer RNAs (eRNAs) are non-coding RNAs transcribed from enhancers that function to promote the enhancer's functions via multiple mechanisms, such as recruiting transcription factors to specific enhancers, promoting enhancer-promoter looping, directing chromatin accessibility, interacting with RNA polymerase II and facilitating histone acetylation. Understa uch regulatory elements often bypass intervening genes and typically comprise binding sites for multiple transcription factors that can also be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to produce noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). G cent studies have shown that active enhancers recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and are transcribed, producing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). GRO ly, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.

Importantly, their rec Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. Enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) are a group of RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II from the domain of transcription enhancers, a major type of cis-regulatory elements in the genome. Enhancers stimulate transcription of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes in an orientation-independent manner and over long distances. Recent work has shown that RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription at distal cis-regulatory elements serves as a mark of highly active enhancers. Based on some reports on RNA polymerase I transcription, we wanted to test whether RNA polymerase II enters at the enhancer and from there proceeds towards the promoter while synthesizing unstable transcripts ("scanning/readthrough transcription" model). We show here that the SV40 enhancer acts at least in part to increase the number of RNA polymerase II molecules transcribing the linked gene.	['RNA polymerase II', 'RNA polII', 'RNAPII']

5d35ee08b3a6380763000012	Which epigenetic marks are deposited by PRC1?	 In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA.  When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). PRC2 induces histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is subsequently read by PRC1 that further catalyzes H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), creating a transcriptional silent chromatin conformation.  Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. For a long time, the PcG mechanism has been proposed to follow a hierarchical recruitment of PcG repressive complexes (PRCs) to target genes in which the binding of PRC2 and the incorporation of H3 lysine 27 trimethyl marks led to recruitment of PRC1, which in turn mediated H2A monoubiquitination. Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. Ho Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer.

6031287e1cb411341a00012d	Which key gene is involved in interstitial 6q25 microdeletion syndrome?	Interstitial 6q25 microdeletion syndrome: ARID1B is the key gene. Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are rare. Clinically, these deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-CGH revealed a small interstitial 6q deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of DNA and containing only one coding gene, ARID1B. We suggest that ARID1B is the key gene behind 6q microdeletion syndrome, and we discuss its possible role in the phenotypic manifestations.

Further elucidation of the functions and regulation of C/EBPβ in hematopoietic stem cells will facilitate an understanding of stress hematopoiesis. Our findings indicate that FancC expression is increased during Stat3- and C/ebpβ-induced initiation of emergency granulopoiesis by these transcription factors and is maintained through termination by Icsbp.

6030fcb51cb411341a000127	Which database exists that contains regulatory sites for splicing in human basal ganglia?	Regulatory sites for splicing in human basal ganglia are enriched for disease-relevant information. Genome-wide association studies have generated an increasing number of common genetic variants associated with neurological and psychiatric disease risk. An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants. However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) signals. We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease. This resource of regulatory data is accessible through our web server, http://braineacv2.inf.um.es/.	['http://braineacv2.inf.um.es/']
601db8111cb411341a00004b	What is a HapMap	We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed The International Haplotype Map Project (HapMap) has provided an essential database for studies of human population genetics and genome-wide association. Phases I and II of the HapMap project generated genotype data across ∼3 million SNP loci in 270 individuals representing four populations. . A haplotype map (HapMap), aimed at describing these variation patterns across the entire genome, has been recently developed by the International HapMap Consortium. . We discuss in the same context the haplotype map project (HapMap) as a tool to facilitate the study of possible associations of genome changes and common diseases. The "HapMap" project is now underway to characterize patterns of LD in the human genome. One of the goals of the International HapMap Project is the identification of common haplotypes in genes. One of the particular important projects is The International HapMap Project which provides the catalogue of human genetic variation for disease association studies. A key goal of the HapMap Project is to enable identification of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture a substantial portion of common human genetic variability while requiring only a small fraction of SNPs to be genotyped [International HapMap Consortium, 2005: Nature 437:1299-1320]. The International HapMap Consortium undertook an effort to catalog all common variation across the genome (variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5% in one or more ethnic groups). al genome collaborations, such as HapMap and the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping project have identified common genetic variations in diseases of major public health importance. Such genetic s To facilitate evaluation of existing evidence of association and further work, we supplemented the extensive genotype data, available through the International HapMap Project (HapMap), about DTNBP1 by specifically typing all associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms reported in each of the studies of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-derived HapMap sample (CEU). In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use the HapMap resource and the Haploview program to process and analyze genetic data from HapMap, to evaluate LD relations between SNPs, and to select tagging SNPs to be examined in disease association studies. With the availability of the HapMap--a resource which describes common patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in four different human population samples, we now have a powerful tool to help dissect the role of genetic variation in the biology of the genome. Although our SNP selection was based on HapMap data, which is a subset of all common SNPs, these panels effectively capture the majority of all common variation and provide high power to detect risk alleles that are not represented in the HapMap data. Our results demonstrate that the HapMap CEU samples provide an adequate basis for tag SNP selection in Finnish individuals, without the need to create a map specifically for the Finnish population, and suggest that the four-population HapMap data will provide useful information for tag SNP selection beyond the specific populations from which they were sampled. RESULTS: For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e.g. The HapMap project is one of the largest public resources of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterizing over 3 million SNPs genotyped in over 1000 individuals. Then, we study how well the HapMap SNPs capture the untyped SNPs in the region. HapMap provides linkage disequilibrium (LD) information on a sample of 3.7 million SNPs that can be used for tag SNP selection in whole-genome association studies. INTRODUCTIONThe primary goal of the International Haplotype Map Project has been to develop a haplotype map of the human genome that describes the common patterns of genetic variation, in order to accelerate the search for the genetic causes of human disease. BACKGROUND: The HapMap project is a publicly available catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in humans, currently including several million SNPs across 1115 individuals spanning 11 different  The goal of the International HapMap Project is to determine the common patterns of DNA sequence variation in the human genome and to make this information freely available in the public domain.

5fe31301a43ad31278000039	Which yeast genes encode for condensin?	Condensin Smc2-Smc4 Dimers Are Flexible and Dynamic. Here, we probe the topology of Smc2-Smc4 dimers of the S. cerevisiae condensin complex with high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid Interestingly, SAC activation is suppressed by the absence of Top2 and Smc2, an essential component of condensin. Indeed, smc2-8 suppresses catenanes accumulation, mitotic arrest and growth defects induced by histone depletion at semi-permissive temperature To better understand the contributions that the structural maintenance of chromosome proteins (SMCs) make to condensin activity, we have tested a number of biochemical, biophysical, and DNA-associated attributes of the Smc2p-Smc4p pair from budding yeast.  Smc2/4 forms the core of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin, which promotes metaphase chromosome compaction Both SMC2 and SMC4 are essential for chromosome transmission in anaphase. Here we demonstrate that three TTN genes encode chromosome scaffold proteins of the condensin (SMC2) and cohesin (SMC1 and SMC3) classes. we demonstrate that three TTN genes encode chromosome scaffold proteins of the condensin (SMC2) and cohesin (SMC1 and SMC3) classes.

5fe08b77a43ad31278000032	Which gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome?	Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed prenatally. It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene. We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. Mutations of the TWIST gene in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalo-syndactyly type III, ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis with brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly and facial dysmorphism including ptosis, facial asymmetry and prominent ear crura. ACS III has been mapped to chromosome 7p21-22. Of interest, TWIST, the human counterpart of the murine Twist gene, has been localized on chromosome 7p21 as well.  Of the 37 patients with classic features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, the overall detection rate for TWIST mutations was 68%.  Increased risk for developmental delay in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated with TWIST deletions: an improved strategy for TWIST mutation screening. Mutations within or upstream of the basic helix-loop-helix domain of the TWIST gene are specific to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome recently ascribed to mutations in the TWIST gene, a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor regulating head mesenchyme cell development during cranial neural tube formation in mouse.  Finally, since no TWIST mutations were detected in 40 cases of isolated coronal craniosynostosis, the present study suggests that TWIST mutations are specific to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Mutations in the basic domain and the loop-helix II junction of TWIST abolish DNA binding in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal dominant skull disorder resulting from premature fusion of coronal sutures (craniosynostosis). It is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene encoding a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor. Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.  Notably, multiple Twist1 mutations associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome alter protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Twist1, suggesting that misregulation of Twist1 dimerization through either stoichiometric or post-translational mechanisms underlies phenotypes of individuals with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by TWIST 1 gene mutations The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome with uni- or bilateral coronal synostosis and mild limb deformities. It is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST 1 gene.  The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), one of the most common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures), results from haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, caused by deletions of the entire gene or loss-of-function variants within the coding region.  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostotic disorder characterized by coronal synostosis, facial asymmetry, ptosis, and limb abnormalities. Haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is responsible for SCS.  The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TWIST1. The majority of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have mutations in the TWIST gene, which codes for a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7p21. The chromosome rearrangement downstream of TWIST is compatible with the notion that this is a Saethre-Chotzen syndrome gene and implies loss of function of one allele by a positional effect as a possible mechanism of mutation to evoke the syndrome. The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, which is defined by loss-of-function mutations in the TWIST gene, is the second most prevalent craniosynostosis. The TWIST gene codes for a transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) motif and has recently been described as a candidate gene for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, based on the detection of mutations within the coding region. Altered Twist1 and Hand2 dimerization is associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and limb abnormalities. Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.  this region, the TWIST1 gene encoding a transcription factor was considered as a strong candidate gene since its haploinsufficiency is responsible for the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, characterized by skull coronal suture synostosis. Sequencin loinsufficiency of the human TWIST1 gene, which causes the craniosynostosis disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), is related to failure to repress transcription of CDKN1A (which encodes p21/WAF1/CIP1), promoting osteoblast differentiation. We have e  such gene that has been implicated in both syndromic (Saethre-Chotzen syndrome) and nonsyndromic forms of CS in humans is TWIST1. In thi Twist1 is the mouse ortholog of TWIST1, the human gene mutated in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. P rigenesis. Some loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST1 gene have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis, known as the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showe eletion of 500 kb included the TWIST1 gene, a suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with RSTS. A similar issue of d Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), one of the most common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures), results from haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, caused by deletions of the entire gene or loss-of-function variants within the coding region. To det Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated with haploinsufficiency of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST1 and is characterized by premature closure of the cranial sutures, termed craniosynostosis; however, the mechanisms underlying this defect are unclear. Twist Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome recently ascribed to mutations in the TWIST gene, a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor regulating head mesenchyme cell development during cranial neural tube formation in mouse. Contiguous gene deletion neighboring TWIST1 identified in a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome associated with neurodevelopmental delay: Possible contribution of HDAC9.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), associated with TWIST-1 mutations, is characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the Twist gene replicate certain features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, but have not been reported to exhibit craniosynostosis. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome whose gene has been assigned to chromosome 7p (TWIST). Comprehensive studies in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have demonstrated a TWIST gene abnormality in about 80%, up to 37% of which may be large deletions [Johnson et al., 1998]. The authors conclude that when using stringent inclusion criteria for studies of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, patients who have a pathogenic mutation of the TWIST gene should be excluded. This case report describes a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by a mutation in the TWIST gene who exhibits a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene. Additional studies are, however, necessary to reveal the mechanism by which TWIST1 may predispose to early onset breast cancer in Saethre-Chotzen patients. However, recent studies, using a murine breast tumor model, have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers. BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chro Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Of the patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation, three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the entire TWIST gene. Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%) with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or TWIST. The TWIST gene, although not disrupted in Saethre-Chotzen patients with apparently balanced translocations of 7p21, is mutated in familial and sporadic cases. We report a young girl with clinical features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome who has a previously undescribed sequence variant in the TWIST1 gene, corresponding to p.R191M.

5fdb2e74a43ad3127800000d	Which master regulator drives liver development?	The molecular mechanisms by which hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4α regulates fetal liver development have not been fully elucidated. SNAT4 functions downstream of HNF4α and plays significant roles in liver development through mechanisms of amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. Here we use mouse genetics to address the role of UPF2, a core NMD component, in the development, function and regeneration of the liver.  Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF-4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4α) is a well-established master regulator of liver development and function.  Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4α) is a well established master regulator of liver development and function.  l-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) plays a critical role in regulating a large number of key genes essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics, metabolic wastes, and nutrients. The expres PAX6), a master regulator of pancreas development overexpressed in colon cancer, cooperated with HNF1α to induce P2-HNF4α but antagonized HNF4α in HNF4A-AS1 expression. Thus, PAX6 may  As a well-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 As a well-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) plays a critical role in regulating a large number of key genes essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics, metabolic wastes, and nutrients. Herein I provide comprehensive review on the regulation of expression and transcriptional activity of HNF4α, and how HNF4α crosstalks with diverse extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways to regulate genes essential in liver pathophysiology. HNF4α appears to play a central role in orchestrating the transduction of extracellular hormonal signaling and intracellular stress/nutritional signaling onto transcriptional changes in the liver. There have been a few reviews on the regulation of drug metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and inflammation by HNF4α. However, the knowledge on how the expression and transcriptional activity of HNF4α is modulated remains scattered. The expression and activity of HNF4α is regulated by diverse hormonal and signaling pathways such as growth hormone, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, insulin, transforming growth factor-β, estrogen, and cytokines. Using in vivo mouse liver development as a model, we identified thousands of enhancers that are bound by the master regulators HNF4A and FOXA2 in a differentiation-dependent manner, subject to chromatin remodeling, and associated with differentially expressed target genes. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a master regulator of development and function of digestive tissues. The transcriptional regulation by these HNFs, which form a hierarchical and cooperative network, is both essential for hepatocyte differentiation during mammalian liver development and also crucial for metabolic regulation and liver function. Studies on the transcriptional regulatory elements of genes expressed in hepatocytes have identified several liver-enriched transcriptional factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, HNF-6 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein families, which are key components of the differentiation process for the fully functional liver. Among these liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF-4 is likely to act the furthest upstream as a master gene in transcriptional cascade and interacts with other liver-enriched transcriptional factors to stimulate hepatocyte-specific gene transcription.

6028183e1cb411341a0000f1	Which subcortical brain structure is influenced the most by common genetic variants?	The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.	['Putamen']
601c4b231cb411341a000020	Givosiran is used for treatment of which disease?	Cost savings with hemin versus givosiran for the treatment of patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).  In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria CONCLUSIONS: Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for all AIP patients and subpopulations.  New treatment options include givosiran (siRNA) to down-regulate ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1) and the messenger RNA of PBGD (PBGD mRNA) delivered to the liver cells of patients with AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. BACKGROUND: Induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1) gene expression and accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates result in neurovisceral attacks and disease manifestations in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, a rare inherited disease of heme biosynthesis. Givosiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1 synthesis.METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. In part A of the trial, patients without recent porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly injections of givosiran in patients who had recurrent porphyria attacks resulted in mainly low-grade adverse events, reductions in induced ALAS1 mRNA levels, nearly normalized levels of the neurotoxic intermediates delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, and a lower attack rate than that observed with placebo.  In November 2019 givosiran became the second small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based drug to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, it has been developed for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a disorder characterized by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks. The clinical performance of givosiran revealed that suppression of ALAS1 by GalNac-decorated siRNAs represents an additional approach for the treatment of patients with AIP that manifests recurrent acute neurovisceral attacks. Phase 3 Trial of RNAi Therapeutic Givosiran for Acute Intermittent Porphyria. Givosiran is being developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). Givosiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid agent that was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). This technology has led to the approval of givosiran for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, and there are another seven conjugates in registrational review or phase 3 trials and at least another 21 conjugates at earlier stages of clinical development. In November 2019, givosiran was approved in the USA for the treatment of adults with AHP based on the positive results from the multinational, phase III ENVISION trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development. This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of subcutaneously (SC) administered givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common AHP type. Givosiran, another RNAi therapeutic, targeting 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, has been positively tested in acute intermittent porphyria in phase 1/2 and ongoing phase 3 trials.	['porphyria']

5fdb4264a43ad31278000023	What is a likely origin of intronless genes?	These highly conserved intronless genes were found to be involved in essential housekeeping functions. Genes without introns are a characteristic feature of prokaryotes, but there are still a number of intronless genes in eukaryotes. Part of intronless genes is derived from other intronless genes or multiexon genes in each species. Hexamer composition comparison allowed the definition of over- and under-represented motifs in intronless genes; surprisingly, experimental testing revealed that intron-lacking coding sequences are enriched rather than depleted in elements with splicing enhancement ability. ntronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function These results indicate that new SEGs are continuously and independently generated after species divergence over evolutionary time as evidenced by the phylogenetic results of single exon claudins genes. strong support for the idea that retrotransposition followed by tandem duplications is the most probable event that can explain the expansion of SEGs in eukaryotic organisms. More than half of SEGs identified in most of the species have at least one ortholog multiple exon gene in the same genome, which provides insight to their possible origin by retrotransposition  IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. Evolutionary analysis revealed that 2601 intronless genes conserved among the three domains of life and 2323 intronless genes that had no homology with genes of other species. Intronless genes can arise by germline retrotransposition of a cDNA originating as mRNA from an intron-containing source gene. We suggest that the intronless rho may have arisen through an ancient retrotransposition of a mature mRNA originating from errlo.	['retrotransposition']

601c3fc21cb411341a000019	Which receptor is blocked by Finerenone?	Finerenone (FIN), a novel, nonsteroidal, potent, and selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improves endothelial dysfunction through enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreasing superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in vascular and renal superoxide dismutase activity. Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys. Other nonsteroidal MRA such as apararenone, finerenone, AZD9977, and LY2623091 are in different clinical trials in patients with hypertension suffering from renal or hepatic fibrotic diseases. (-)-Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes.  Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists: a Comprehensive Review of Finerenone. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to review the mechanism of action and safety profile of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and discuss the differences between selective and non-selective MRAs. More specifically, finerenone is a new medication that is currently under investigation for its promising cardiovascular and nephrological effects.  A new selective MRA named finerenone (originally BAY 94-8862) has shown promising results in several trials (ARTS-HF and ARTS-DN) and smaller studies. Finerenone may have a dose-dependent benefit over older MRAs, decreasing rates of albuminuria and levels of BNP and NT-ProBNP without causing a significant increase in serum potassium levels. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism by finerenone is sufficient to improve function in preclinical muscular dystrophy. The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone prevents cardiac fibrotic remodeling. A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis induced by short-term isoproterenol injection was used to compare the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone and the steroidal MRA eplerenone in equi-efficient systemic MR blocking dosages. Finerenone is a novel selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Finerenone is a selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Nonsteroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Finerenone Protects Against Acute Kidney Injury-Mediated Chronic Kidney Disease: Role of Oxidative Stress. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored. The Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rat is a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low nitric oxide availability. We hypothesize that the new highly selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, finerenone, reverses both endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Two months after coronary artery ligation causing MI, mice with VSMC-specific MR deletion (MI-MR(SMKO)) and mice treated with the MR antagonist finerenone (MI-fine) had improved left ventricular compliance and elastance when compared with infarcted control mice (MI-CTL), as well as reduced interstitial fibrosis. Importantly, the coronary reserve assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was preserved (difference in myocardial perfusion before and after induction of vasodilatation, mL mg(-1) min(-1): MI-CTL: 1.1 ± 0.5, nonsignificant; MI-MR(SMKO): 4.6 ± 1.6 [P<0.05]; MI-fine: 3.6 ± 0.7 [P<0.01]). AIMS: To investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and at high risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening renal dysfunction. Finerenone : third-generation mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and diabetic kidney disease. Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal MRA, with higher selectivity toward the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared to spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone. Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy.

The OTOF (Locus: DFNB9), encoding otoferlin, is reported to be one of the major causes of non-syndromic hearing loss, and is also reported to be the most common cause of non-syndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Otoferlin (OTOF) gene mutations are the most common cause of hereditary ANSD according to investigations in several countries. Different mutations of the OTOF gene, encoding for otoferlin protein expressed in the cochlear inner hair cells, induces a form of deafness that is the major cause of nonsyndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder in humans. Mutations in OTOF (otoferlin) can be the cause of nonsyndromic deafness DFNB9. The OTOF gene encodes otoferlin, a critical protein at the synapse of auditory sensory cells, the inner hair cells (IHCs). In the absence of otoferlin, signal transmission of IHCs fails due to impaired release of synaptic vesicles at the IHC synapse.

5fe31305a43ad3127800003b	What is the target of adalimumab?	The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local (intra-articular) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA The kinetics of adalimumab permeation to the synovial fluid (0.00422 L/h clearance of permeation) versus the rate of TNFα turnover in the affected joints (1.84 pmol/h synthesis rate and 0.877 h(-1) degradation rate constant) are apparently the major parameters that determine the time course of TNFα concentrations in the synovial fluid and the TNFα-neutralizing effects of adalimumab in RA patients. Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF.  Adalimumab (ADA) is able to induce a comprehensive disease control in RA by achieving clinical, functional and radiographic control Targeted drugs against key pathogenetic molecules such as TNF-alpha have significantly improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They are widely used in clinical practice and drug registries give us information to support their use Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a central cytokine in the immune response in psoriasis that has already been shown to be an effective target for therapy.  Adalimumab is a human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody that has been reported to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety, resulting in reversal of epidermal hyperplasia and cutaneous inflammation. major pathway of TNFα elimination from the synovial fluid (∼77% for subcutaneous administration, and ∼72% for intravenous and intra-articular administration of adalimumab 40 mg) is interaction with adalimumab, which reaches the joints following local or systemic administration.CONC eability of TNFα, which is excessively secreted in the joints, is even higher than that of adalimumab. As  Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF. Most currently available molecules target TNF-alfa with different strategies (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 (tocilizumab), CTLA-4 (abatacept), and B cells (rituximab, belimumab) as they are key mediators in the cascade of inflammation. ces in knowledge of the pathogenesis of psoriasis have enabled the development of new drugs that target cytokines (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab, which target TNF α , and ustekinumab, which targets the p40 subunit of IL23 and IL12). These drugs  There are currently two Food and Drug Administration-approved classes of biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha): anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (adalimumab and infliximab), and soluble TNF receptors (etanercept). This st meric anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab, full human anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, and TNF receptor II (p75) -IgGFc fusion protein, etanercept, are widely used in the inflammatory disorders including RA. This review arti urrently available molecules target TNF-alfa with different strategies (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 (tocilizumab), CTLA-4 (abatacept), and B cells (rituximab, belimumab) as they are key mediators in the cascade of inflammation. Further, small molecu clonal antibodies against VEGF and TNF-alpha such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, infliximab and adalimumab have been used to control neovascularization and inflammation in eye with significant positive results whereas others have been used to target CD20, CD52, CD11a, and IL-2. The growin eview focuses on five biologics which target either T-cells (alefacept) or TNF-alpha (etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab) or interleukin IL-12/IL-23 (ustekinumab)--their efficacy, safety, patient monitoring and recommended dosage. The purpose of Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha approved for moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In clinical practice patients who have not responded to one TNF antagonist may respond to another TNF antagonist. The ADAbs can diminish the therapeutic effects of adalimumab by neutralizing the TNFα binding site or increasing its clearance from circulation.M Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeted toward tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories) is the first fully human, recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets human TNF. Adalimumab blocks the interaction of TNF with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, thereby neutralising the activity of this cytokine.

601c17c21cb411341a00000e	The Shingrix vaccine is used to prevent what disease?	Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a challenging condition for pain management specialists. The prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and subsequent PHN in individuals aged 50 years and older, via the development of new vaccines, is an ongoing research project. The live zoster vaccine (LZV, Zostavax®) was the first proof of concept that vaccination could prevent HZ, but LZV cannot be used in various immunecompromised patients. This led to the development of a new non-live recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix®).   Previously, secondary prevention of herpes zoster required live-attenuated vaccination, which is contraindicated in immunocompromised populations. More recently, a recombinant subunit vaccine (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. SHINGRIX, a non-live recombinant herpes zoster vaccine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017. Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix) to Prevent Herpes Zoster. Two different vaccines have been developed to prevent HZ; one is based on a live attenuated VZV strain (Zostavax), and the other is based on adjuvanted gE recombinant protein (Shingrix).

The PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was well tolerated in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) is a humanised anti-programmed death-1 (anti PD-1) antibody. Decitabine plus camrelizumab may reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Addition of Low-Dose Decitabine to Anti-PD-1 Antibody Camrelizumab in Relapsed/Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. CONCLUSION CR rate in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were clinically naïve to PD-1 blockade was significantly higher with decitabine plus camrelizumab than with camrelizumab alone. As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Recent phase 1-2 trials reported manageable safety profiles and promising antitumor activities of anti-PD-1 drugs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab and JS001) with/without chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC), however head-to-head comparison among these regimens is lacking.

After 15 months, due to tumor progression and brain metastasis, he started with administration of anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab (200 mg q2w) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).  We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients. This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In our present report, we described a newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer patient who suffered from focal vitiligo for approximately ten years and was treated with the anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor antibody camrelizumab (SHR-1210), which accelerated the aggravation of depigmentation of the skin over the whole body in just half a year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, phase II study, the safety and efficacy of combined regimen of chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GVD) plus anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was assessed in rrPMBCL.  Apatinib plus camrelizumab (anti-PD1 therapy, SHR-1210) for advanced osteosarcoma (APFAO) progressing after chemotherapy: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial. We further benchmarked the dissociation kinetics for three clinically approved PD-1 blockade mAbs (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Camrelizumab), intriguingly correlating well with the objective response rates in the hepatocellular carcinoma second-line treatment. Purpose: Camrelizumab inhibits PD-1 in non-clinical models and showed typical non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles for an IgG4 monoclonal antibody.  Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor. sions: Our findings suggest that (I) PD-1 targeted immunotherapy with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab yielded a promising outcome in Chinese HBV patients with HCC and that (II) immunotherapy was well tolerated generally and had manageable side effects.

PURPOSE: We assessed the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) plus apatinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGFR]-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, all three patients responded to low-dose decitabine, an epigenetic drug, in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), with only controllable adverse events, indicating that low-dose decitabine can sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Background: Camrelizumab is a promising anti-programmed cell death-1 agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and induces reactive capillary hemangiomas (RCHs).  Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor; however, current evidence of its efficacy in PSC is lacking. Camrelizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor originally developed in China for the treatment of refractory lymphoma.  Recent phase 1-2 trials reported manageable safety profiles and promising antitumor activities of anti-PD-1 drugs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab and JS001) with/without chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC), however head-to-head comparison among these regimens is lacking.  Camrelizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

6086f0ef4e6a4cf630000011	What is a foam cell?	Foam cell, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, is prominently derived from monocyte-differentiated macrophage, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through unlimitedly phagocytizing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Therefore, the inhibition of monocyte adhesion to endothelium and uptake of oxLDL might be a breakthrough point for retarding atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that contributes to multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and foam cell formation plays important roles in the progression of AS. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and foam cell formation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are considered to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Excessive accumulation of lipid inclusions in the arterial wall cells (foam cell formation) caused by modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the earliest and most noticeable manifestation of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of foam cell formation are not fully understood and can involve altered lipid uptake, impaired lipid metabolism, or both. Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, a key feature of foam cells, constitutes an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis.

601ff4a61cb411341a000076	What class of drugs frequently has muscle pain and other muscle toxicities such as mysositis and rhabdomyolysis as a side effect?	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase reductase inhibitors (statins) are generally well tolerated, with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) the most common side effect (~10%) seen in statin users.  Muscular complaints are known side-effects of statin therapy, ranging from myalgia to clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis.   the statin use and association with the presence and characteristics of muscular complaints. n the studied set of patients muscular symptoms were a rather frequent effect of statin therapy.  yopathy is included among the potential side-effects and toxicities associated with the lipid lowering agents, particularly 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. However, the precise mechanism of statin-induced muscle toxicity remains unclear. Lipid lowering drugs, such as statins, are commonly used to treat approximately 10 million Canadians affected by hypercholesterolemia. The most commonly experienced side-effect of statin medication is muscle pain Statin induced myopathy consists of a spectrum of myopathic disorders ranging from mild myalgia to fatal rhabdomyolysis  The following is a presentation of 2 cases of statin induced myopathy in patients  In addition, discussion will surround the mechanism, predisposing risk factors and frequency of statin induced myopathy Rhabdomyolysis is a known, rare serious side effect of statin monotherapy and of statin-fibrate combination therapy. Statin use is associated with a variety of overtly related muscle symptoms including muscle pain, myalgia, creatine kinase elevations without pain with myolysis and myositis (rhabdomyolysis), a potentially fatal side effect that led to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001. CYP2D6*4 polymorphism is associated with statin-induced muscle effects. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. The drugs which most frequently induce muscular side effects are steroids, statins, fibrates, antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants, colchicine, amiodarone, and anticancer drugs. Muscular side effects of various anesthetics, analgetics, antibiotics, antihistaminic drugs, antiretrovirals, cardiotropics, immunosuppressants, lipid-lowering drugs, psychotropic drugs, anticancer drugs, and other substances are more frequent than assumed and are easily overlooked. Muscle pain is a frequent adverse effect of statins. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with lipid-lowering drugs. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal Myopathy caused by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) alone is rare, but occurs more frequently when a statin is used with gemfibrozil, a medication that likely has a direct toxic effect on muscles. Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs. Rhabdomyolysis from the combination of a statin and gemfibrozil: an uncommon but serious adverse reaction.	['statins']

Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

6081b64d4e6a4cf63000000a	What is the function of the HSJ1 proteins?	HSJ1 (DNAJB2), a member of the DNAJ family of molecular chaperones, is a key player in neuronal proteostasis maintenance. HSJ1 is a neuronal enriched member of the HSP40/DNAJ co-chaperone family. Previous studies have shown that HSP40 proteins play a crucial role in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in several neuronal types, in animal models and human diseases. Homo sapiens J domain protein (HSJ1) is a J-domain containing co-chaperone that is known to stimulate ATPase activity of HSP70 chaperone, while it also harbors two ubiquitin (Ub)-interacting motifs (UIMs) that may bind with ubiquitinated substrates and potentially function in protein degradation.

5fe09c99a43ad31278000033	What percentage of C. elegans genes reside in operons?	Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.  Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Overall, our data demonstrate that >17% of all C. elegans genes are in operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Like more than 15% of C. elegans genes, xrn-2 occurs in an operon, and we identify additional operons under its control, consistent with a broader function of XRN2 in polycistronic gene regulation. provides convincing evidence that at least 15% of Caenorhabditis elegans genes are co-transcribed within over a thousand operons. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the genome contains >1000 operons that compose approximately 15% of the protein-coding genes. Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis.

6020a9f11cb411341a000080	Which animal bite can cause Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection?	INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections are associated with dog bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients, and typically manifest as sepsis and/or bacteremia.  CONCLUSION: C. canimorsus meningitis is a rare but increasingly important clinical entity occurring in patients of all ages, typically after dog exposure. INTRODUCTION: The gram-negative bacteria known as Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus) is found in dog saliva and rarely can cause severe infection in humans following a bite or scratch.  PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we describe the second ever published case of C. canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis. The patient presented with epigastric pain and sepsis three weeks post domestic dog bite.  CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate blood cultures in patients who present with abdominal pain and sepsis, particularly when they have a recent history of animal bite. In cases of cholecystitis secondary to C. canimorsus it may be necessary to monitor the patient's progress more closely and treat with prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy.

601d79e01cb411341a000047	Which R/Bioconductor package has been developed for network-based differential expression analysis?	INDEED: R package for network based differential expression analysis These interactions are typically evaluated by correlation methods that tend to generate over-complicated networks due to many seemingly indirect associations. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package INDEED that allows users to construct a sparse network based on partial correlation, and to identify biomolecules that have significant changes both at individual expression and pairwise interaction levels. We applied INDEED for analysis of two omic datasets acquired in a cancer biomarker discovery study to help rank disease-associated biomolecules.

6060701c94d57fd87900003c	Which R/bioconductor package exists for discovery of intergenic transcripts?	PRAM: a novel pooling approach for discovering intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments. Publicly available RNA-seq data is routinely used for retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology. Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA-seq data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a '2-Step' approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq data sets, we developed a novel '1-Step' approach named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA-seq data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of PRAM to mouse hematopoietic RNA-seq data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene Pik3cg implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human. PRAM is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package.	['PRAM', 'Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models']

Gender identity and role in a pedigree of Arabs with intersex due to 5 alpha reductase-2 deficiency Between 1986 and 1995, a pedigree of six Arabs with male pseudohermaphroditism due to 5 alpha reductase-2 deficiency have been identified. In the 20 yr since it was established that impairment of dihydrotestosterone formation is the cause of a rare form of human intersex, a wealth of information has accumulated about the genetics, endocrinology, and variable phenotypic manifestations, culminating in the cloning of cDNAs encoding two 5 alpha-reductase genes and documentation that mutations in the steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 gene are the cause of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. It is also imperative to establish whether defects in steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2, perhaps in the heterozygous state, are responsible for a portion of cases of sporadic hypospadias, to determine whether 5 alpha-reductase plays a role in progesterone action in women, and to elucidate the relation between androgen action and gender role behavior. Virilization of the external genitalia in the male fetus requires testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is formed from testosterone by the action of the enzyme, 5alpha-reductase type 2 (5alphaR-2). Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical spectrum ranges from a male phenotype with hypospadia to a female phenotype with normal wolffian structures Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is a rare disorder leading to male pseudohermaphroditism, a condition characterized by incomplete differentiation of male genitalia in 46,XY patients. H ch impairs DHT formation (mutation within the 5alphaR-2 gene or 5alphaR-2 inhibitors) or normal function of the AR (mutation in the AR gene, antiandrogens) may result in insufficient androgen action in the male fetus and in subsequent undervirilization in the newborn.

Sequencing of the entire SRY gene, incl In 1974, a lack of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), the most potent androgen across species except for fish, was shown to be the origin of a type of pseudohermaphrodism in which boys have female-like external genitalia. Molecular studies were focused on coding sequences of the SRY gene (case 1) and 2 candidates for monogenic hypospadias, namely MAMLD1 (mastermind-like domain containing 1) and SRD5A2 (steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2). None of the identified polymorphisms cosegregated with the intersexual phenotype, thus, we cannot confirm that hypospadias may be associated with polymorphism in the coding sequence of the studied genes. This animal was classified as a compound sex reversal (78,XX, SRY-negative) with the hypospadias syndrome. Hypospadias in a male (78,XY; SRY-positive) dog and sex reversal female (78,XX; SRY-negative) dogs: clinical, histological and genetic studies. Hence, steroid 5 alpha-reductase deficiency should be considered not only in sex reversed patients with female or ambiguous phenotypes, but also in those with mild symptoms of undermasculinization as encountered in patients with hypospadias and/or micropenis. Phenotypic classification of male pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. A classification based on the severity of the masculinization defect may be used for correlation of phenotypes with enzyme activities and genotypes, and for comparisons of phenotypes between different patients as the basis for clinical decisions to be made in patients with pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. Inactivating mutations of the 5α-steroid reductase type-2 (SRD5A2) gene result in a broad spectrum of masculinization defects, ranging from a male phenotype with hypospadias to a female phenotype with Wolffian structures.

Liebenberg syndrome is caused by a deletion upstream to the PITX1 gene resulting in transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics The deleted region is upstream to the PITX1 gene.  We therefore re-define the phenotype of Liebenberg syndrome as a transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics and speculate that the area of deletion contains a regulatory sequence that suppresses the expression of PITX1 in the upper limb buds.

6068640894d57fd87900004b	What is the function of the Eyeless associated gene in Drosophila?	Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless (ey) is one of the most critical transcription factors for initiating the entire eye development in Drosophila. ax6 transcription factors are essential upstream regulators in the developing anterior brain and peripheral visual system of most bilaterian animals. While a single homolog is in charge of these functions in vertebrates, two Pax6 genes are in Drosophila: eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy)  Eye development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is driven by the highly conserved selector gene network referred to as the "retinal determination gene network," composed of approximately 20 factors, whose core comprises twin of eyeless (toy), eyeless (ey), sine oculis (so), dachshund (dac), and eyes absent (eya). These genes encode transcriptional regulators that are each necessary for normal eye development Mutational analysis of the eyeless gene and phenotypic rescue reveal that an intact Eyeless protein is necessary for normal eye and brain development in Drosophila. Loss of Pax 6 function leads to an eyeless phenotype in both mammals and insects, and ectopic expression of both the Drosophila and the mouse gene leads to the induction of ectopic eyes in Drosophila, which suggested to us that Pax 6 might be a universal master control gene for eye morphogenesis. These data, along with the phenotypes observed in the four newly characterized eyeless alleles, demonstrate the requirement for an intact Eyeless protein for normal Drosophila eye and brain development. The Pax6 genes eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy) are upstream regulators in the retinal determination gene network (RDGN), which instructs the formation of the adult eye primordium in Drosophila. In Drosophila, two Pax6 genes function in a pathway in which twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates eyeless (ey), which is necessary for initiating the eye developmental pathway. this, we present evidence that eyeless (ey), which encodes the Drosophila homolog of Pax-6, directly regulates rhodopsin 1 (rh1) expression in the photoreceptor cells. We detect ey expressi The Drosophila compound eye is specified by the simultaneous and interdependent activity of transcriptional regulatory genes from four families: PAX6 (eyeless, twin of eyeless, eyegone), EYA (eyes absent), SIX (sine oculis, Optix) and DACH (dachshund). Mammals hav We describe here the role of the transcription factors encoding genes tailless (tll), atonal (ato), sine oculis (so), eyeless (ey) and eyes absent (eya), and EGFR signaling in establishing the Drosophila embryonic visual system. The embryon The eyeless, dachshund, and eyes absent genes encode conserved, nuclear proteins that are essential for eye development in Drosophila. The Drosophila homologue of Pax6, eyeless, is also necessary for correct invertebrate eye development, and its misexpression leads to formation of ectopic eyes in Drosophila. Differential expression and function of the Drosophila Pax6 genes eyeless and twin of eyeless in embryonic central nervous system development. The eyeless homeodomain is dispensable for eye development in Drosophila. eyeless (ey) is a key regulator of the eye development pathway in Drosophila. Previous work has demonstrated the existence of a functional network and genetic regulatory hierarchy in Drosophila in which eyeless (ey, the Pax6 orthologue), eyes absent (eya), and dac operate together to regulate Drosophila eye development, and that ey regulates the expression of eya and dac. Drosophila Pax-6/eyeless is essential for normal adult brain structure and function. A combination of bioinformatics, comparative expression profiling and microarray-based epistasis experiments has recently identified new targets of Eyeless, a key transcription factor in Drosophila retinal determination. In 1995, the eyeless (ey) gene was dubbed the "master-regulator" of eye development in Drosophila. eyeless, which encodes a Pax6 transcription factor, is expressed early in progenitors and controls aspects of this cell migration. The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a paired domain and a homeodomain. Eye specification in Drosophila is thought be controlled by a set of seven nuclear factors that includes the Pax6 homolog, Eyeless. A role for the Pax-6 homologue eyeless in adult Drosophila brain development and function is described. We show that several binding sites are required for the eye specific expression, and, therefore, we propose a Pax-6-like molecule to be a positive transactivator for the eye specific ey expression. In Drosophila eyeless and twin of eyeless, play non-redundant roles in the developing retina. Members of one subclass, Pax6, function as selector genes and play key roles in the retinal development of all seeing animals. The identification of both transcriptional activator and repressor activity within the Pax6 protein furthers our understanding of how this gene family regulates tissue determination. eyeless induces much larger ectopic eyes, at higher frequencies, and in a broader range of tissues than twin of eyeless. Pax genes encode DNA binding proteins that play pivotal roles in the determination of complex tissues. The Drosophila Pax-6 gene eyeless (ey) plays a key role in eye development. The two Pax6 gene homologs eyeless and twin of eyeless play decisive early roles in Drosophila eye development.	['transcription factor', 'transcriptional regulator', 'eye development']

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents have revolutionized the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These therapies are, however, expensive and 30% of patients fail to respond.  By contrast, those patients who had failed to respond to 2 or more anti-TNF agents had a 72.5% lower probability of achieving a moderate to good EULAR response A 12-month EULAR non-response was observed in 153/821 (18.6%) associated with a higher baseline HAQ score (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03-2.20, p: 0.033), prior treatment with >3 DMARDs (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.09-2.85; p: 0.021) and corticosteroid >5 mg/day (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06-3.97; p: 0.034) We found that only a minority of patients with long-standing RA treated with anti-TNF agents achieve a good clinical response or remission. Agreement between responses was substantial at the overall/ACR20 level (about 95%, kappa = 0.7 or better) for all criteria. After 6 months, 18% had a good EULAR response, of whom 9% were considered to be in remission and 50% had a moderate response. Anti-TNF treatments are effective and safe, reducing the activity of the disease, disability, and the need for corticosteroids. Patients who displayed good adherence prior to the anti-TNF treatment and were treated with etanercept or with increasing doses of infliximab had the best chance of displaying a response.

5e4e3cee6d0a277941000030	Which component of the Influenza A Virus affects mRNA transcription termination?	Optimized conditions are presented for the T7 and SP6 phage polymerase systems to minimize these early termination events during in vitro transcription of H5 influenza vRNA. Viruses have evolved a number of translational control mechanisms to regulate the levels of expression of viral proteins on polycistronic mRNAs, including programmed ribosomal frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. More recently, another unusual mechanism has been described, that of termination-dependent re-initiation (also known as stop-start). We conclude that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme and that (-)-carbovir most likely inhibits HIV by activity at the triphosphate level by a combination of direct competition for binding of the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the reverse transcriptase and chain termination.  One such mechanism, that of termination-dependent reinitiation, has been described in a number of both negative- and positive-strand RNA viruses.  For example, the segment 7 RNA of influenza B is dicistronic, and the stop codon of the M1 ORF and the start codon of the BM2 ORF overlap in the pentanucleotide UAAUG (the stop codon of M1 is shown in bold and the start codon of BM2 is underlined). The present review summarizes how such interactions regulate reinitiation in an array of RNA viruses, and discusses what is known about reinitiation in viruses that do not rely on apparent mRNA-rRNA interactions. Using cell biological, biochemical, and genetic tools, we reveal that influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces global transcriptional defects at the 3' ends of active host genes and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) run-through into extragenic regions. This phenomenon occurs with multiple strains of IAV, is dependent on influenza NS1 protein, and can be modulated by SUMOylation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of NS1 expressed by the 1918 pandemic IAV strain These studies establish that during influenza virus infections processing of the NS1 mRNA transcript undergoes a mechanism of splicing similar to that occurring with DNA-directed RNA transcription. Influenza virus gene 8 codes for two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) which are translated, respectively, from a colinear and an interrupted mRNA. Defective Pol II termination occurs independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host mRNA processing.	['NS1', 'The IAV NS1 protein']

601ebba41cb411341a00005a	Which R/Bioconductor package has been developed for visualizing differential amino acid group usage in proteomics?	dagLogo: An R/Bioconductor package for identifying and visualizing differential amino acid group usage in proteomics data Sequence logos have been widely used as graphical representations of conserved nucleic acid and protein motifs. Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.

The effects of anifrolumab on type I IFN pathway activation were assessed using signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation, IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase reporter cell assays and type I IFN gene signature induction. Randomization was stratified by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score (<10 or ≥10), oral corticosteroid dosage (<10 or ≥10 mg/day), and type I IFN gene signature test status (high or low) based on a 4-gene expression assay. patients with a high IFN signature at baseline  Patients were stratified by disease activity, interferon gene-signature test (high vs low based on the expression of four genes) and geographical region.  Our group, using microarray analysis, identified the interferon (IFN) gene signature in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has published data that suggest high doses of intravenous corticosteroid treatment may have benefit over strictly oral regimens. In this study, we report the presence of IFN activation in SLE bone marrow (BM), as measured by an IFN gene signature, increased IFN regulated chemokines, and direct production of IFN by BM-resident cells, associated with profound changes in B cell development. Pronounced alterations in B cell development were noted in SLE in the presence of an IFN signature with a reduction in the fraction of pro/pre-B cells, suggesting an inhibition in early B cell development and an expansion of B cells at the transitional stage.  At baseline, patients had moderate-to-severe disease activity (mean SLE Disease Activity Index score 11.0), and most (75.2%) had a high type I interferon (IFN) gene signature.  Inhibition of the type I IFN gene signature was sustained during treatment in patients with a high baseline signature.  Patient baseline body WT, interferon gene signature from 21 genes, steroid use, and sifalimumab dose were identified as significant covariates for CL, whereas only baseline body WT was a significant covariate for V 1 and peripheral volume of distribution (V 2) These include: type I interferon (IFN) gene signature as a pharmacodynamic marker and potential predictive marker for anti-type I IFN therapy; anti-double stranded DNA as a disease marker and potential predictive marker for flares; the complements and neutrophil signatures as disease marker of SLE All SLE B cell populations revealed an interferon (IFN) gene signature previously only reported in unseparated SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements aseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (P < .0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients compared with healthy volunteers.  In addition, platelets with type I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE. During the trial, we also examined whether overexpression of an IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signature in whole blood could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to evaluate IFNalpha neutralization and investigated downstream effects of neutralizing IFNalpha on BAFF and other key signaling pathways, i.e., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and IL-1beta, in SLE IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signatures in whole blood are effective pharmacodynamic biomarkers to evaluate anti-IFNalpha mAb therapy in SLE SLE is characterized by a type-I interferon gene signature. These observations provide a link between dysregulation of apoptosis and phagocytosis and the type-I interferon signature observed in SLE patients. Of interest, the IFN gene 'signature' correlates with more severe disease.  A role for interferon (IFN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis is inferred from the prominent IFN gene signature (IGS), but the major IFN species and its relationship to disease activity are unknown. Interferon (IFN) signature genes have been shown to be expressed highly in peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in the presence of active disease. OBJECTIVE: The interferon (IFN) signature is related to disease activity and vascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and represents a promising therapeutic target. BACKGROUND: There is increased expression of type I interferon (IFN)-regulated proteins in the blood and target tissues of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The  This study investigated serum IL-3 and IFN levels, and a whole blood 'IL-3 gene signature', in human SLE SION: SLE patients demonstrated increased expression of an IFN response gene signature (75% of patients had an elevated IFN response gene signature) at baseline in ILLUMINATE-1 and ILLUMINATE-2. Subs SLE patients exhibit increased IFN signatures in their skin secondary to increased production and a robust, skewed IFN response that is regulated by PITX1.  An earlier study showed that SLE patients carrying an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature in blood have elevated serum levels of IFN-regulated chemokines  The role of type I interferon (IFN) in SLE has been demonstrated from the 2000s, by gene expression analyses showing significant over-expression of genes related to type I IFN signalling pathway (IFN signature) The type I interferon (IFN) gene signature and circulating autoantibodies are hallmarks of SLE. Many SLE patients have increased serum levels of IFN-alpha and display an IFN gene expression "signature" characterized by strong overexpression of IFN-responsive genes in leukocytes and target tissues.  However, several studies questioned the role of measuring the intensity of IFN signature (IFN score) to chase SLE activity A bioinformatic approach employing individual IFN species gene signatures to interrogate SLE microarray datasets demonstrates a putative role for numerous IFN species, with prominent expression of IFNB1 and IFNW signatures. GS test-high patients overexpressed many gene signatures associated with SLE pathogenesis compared with IFNGS test-low patients, reflecting broad immune activation. Th I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (P < .0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients compared with healthy volunteers. An increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes, termed IFN signature, has been reported in patients with SLE. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we now show that active SLE can be distinguished by a remarkably homogeneous gene expression pattern with overexpression of granulopoiesis-related and interferon (IFN)-induced genes. OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) and IFNgamma to the IFN gene expression signature that has been observed in microarray screens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of healthy control PBMCs was used to determine the relative induction of a panel of IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) by IF osus (SLE). Patients with SLE have increased IFN-regulated gene expression pointing towards a possible underlying genetic defect.OBJECTIVES: To determine expression levels of five type I IFN-regulated genes that are highly expressed in SLE in the peripheral blood of patients with CLE and to correlate the expression levels with cutaneous disease activity.METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 healthy controls and 30 patients with CLE, incl Up-regulation of a set of 63 IFN signature genes was seen in 83% of SLE patients and 50% of ILE patients.

Intramuscular hemangiomas of the masseter muscle are uncommon tumors and therefore can be difficult to accurately diagnose preoperatively, due to the unfamiliar presentation and deep location in the lateral face. A case of intramuscular hemangioma of the masseter muscle in a 66-yearold woman is presented. As part of this study, a comparative analysis of the temporal and masseter muscle electrical activity at rest and during mandible excursion positions (protrusion, laterotrusion and maximal occlusion) was performed among patients aged 21 to 68 years.  Masticatory myofascial trigger points (TrP) are one of the major causes of nondental pain in the orofacial region. Intramuscular injections are considered the first-line treatment for myofascial TrPs. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local anesthesia (LA), botulinum toxin (BTX), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for the treatment of myofascial TrPs in the masseter muscle.

We highlight additional evidence consistent with the underwhelming efficacy of Aβ oligomer-lowering agents, such as aducanumab, and of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, versus the so far isolated case report that DNase-I treatment for 2 months resulted in a severe AD patient's Mini-Mental State Exam score increasing from 3 to 18, reversing his diagnosis to moderate AD, according to the Mini-Mental State Exam. On 7 June 2021, aducanumab was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) by the FDA on the basis of amyloid-lowering effects considered reasonably likely to confer clinical benefit. This decision makes aducanumab the first new drug to be approved for the treatment of AD since 2003 and the first drug to ever be approved for modification of the course of AD. While the vast majority of immunotherapies have been developed for Aβ and tested in Alzheimer's disease, the field has progressed to targeting other proteins including αSyn. Despite showing some remarkable results in animal models, immunotherapies have largely failed final stages of clinical trials to date, with the exception of Aducanumab recently licenced in the US by the FDA. The recent approval of aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease has heightened the interest in therapies targeting the amyloid hypothesis. Aducanumab (Aduhelm), the first new drug to treat Alzheimer's disease since 2003, has received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aducanumab is approved in the United States for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment or mild-dementia stage of AD. On the one hand, aducanumab is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of the disease since 2003 and is the first drug to act on the alleged pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. In June 2021, aducanumab received its first approval in the USA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. On June 7, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved aducanumab, a monoclonal amyloid targeting β-amyloid, for the treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to aggregated amyloid-β to reduce the number of amyloid plaques and slow disease progression, was approved to treat AD by the US Food and Drug Administration on June 7, 2021. The regulatory approval of the disease-modifying agent aducanumab has brought more attention to the complexity of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of AD and the difficult decisions payers and policy makers will face over the next few years as innovation continues in this space. Based on the reduction of amyloid β plaques, US FDA has recently approved Aducanumab as a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

APOBEC1 is a member of the AID/APOBECs, a group of deaminases responsible for the editing of C>U in both DNA and RNA. The human genome contains 11 APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases classified into four families. These proteins function mainly in innate antiviral immunity and can also restrict endogenous retrotransposable element multiplication.  Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) catalyses the deamination of deoxycytidines to deoxyuracils within immunoglobulin genes to induce somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination Efficient humoral responses rely on DNA damage, mutagenesis and error-prone DNA repair. Diversification of B cell receptors through somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination are initiated by cytidine deamination in DNA mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)1 and by the subsequent excision of the resulting uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) and by mismatch repair proteins1-3.

62532ffee764a53204000023	Ladybird homeobox (Lbx) transcription factors regulate the development of what body systems/organs?	Ladybird homeobox (Lbx) transcription factors have crucial functions in muscle and nervous system development in many animals. Lbx/ladybird genes originated as part of the metazoan cluster of Nk homeobox genes. In all animals investigated so far, both the protostome genes and the vertebrate Lbx1 genes were found to play crucial roles in neural and muscle development. The Drosophila ladybird homeobox gene (lad) functions in founder cells of the segmental border muscle to promote myoblast fusion and muscle shaping. Our data reveal that ladybird not only contributes to the combinatorial code of transcription factors specifying the identity of muscle and cardiac precursors, but also regulates a large number of genes involved in setting cell shape, adhesion, and motility. A prior genetic analysis showed that during Drosophila muscle and heart development ladybird is required for the specification of a subset of muscular and cardiac precursors. The Hmx gene family is a new class of homeobox-containing genes defined by a conserved homeobox region and a characteristic pattern of expression in the central nervous system that is more rostral than that of the Hox genes. Ladybird (Lbx) homeodomain transcription factors function in neural and muscle development--roles conserved from Drosophila to vertebrates.

601db4ac1cb411341a000048	What is the protein that is truncated to produce progerin?	Mutations in lamin A (LMNA) are responsible for a variety of human dystrophic and metabolic diseases. Here, we created a mouse model in which progerin, the lamin A mutant protein that causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), can be inducibly overexpressed. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare laminopathy that produces a mutant form of prelamin A, known as Progerin Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced "progerin The main cause of HGPS is a sporadic autosomal dominant point mutation in LMNA gene resulting in differently spliced lamin A protein known as progerin. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disorder notably characterized by precocious and deadly atherosclerosis. Almost 90% of HGPS patients carry a LMNA p.G608G splice variant that leads to the expression of a permanently farnesylated abnormal form of prelamin-A, referred to as progerin.  Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a progeroid disease characterized by the early onset of age-related phenotypes including arthritis, loss of body fat and hair, and atherosclerosis. Cells from affected individuals express a mutant version of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A (termed progerin) and have previously been shown to exhibit prominent histone modification changes.M Our approach involves expression of progerin, a truncated form of lamin A associated with premature aging. Progerin, a C-terminal truncated lamin A mutant, causes premature aging termed Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a disorder of premature aging in children caused by de novo mutations in LMNA that lead to the synthesis of an internally truncated form of prelamin A (commonly called progerin). The production of progeri It is caused by a mutation in LMNA leading to expression of truncated prelamin A (progerin) in the nucleus. Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) lead to expression of a protein called progerin with 50 amino acids deleted from the tail of prelamin A. In Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder, caused by mutation in the gene encoding lamin A/C, which produces a truncated protein called progerin. In rly 90% of HGPS sufferers carry a G608G mutation within exon 11 of LMNA, producing a truncated form of prelamin A, referred to as "progerin". Here s mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, and the truncated protein is called progerin. Pr wide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called prog mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, producing a truncated farnesylated protein called progerin. Lami PS is almost always caused by a de novo point mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA) that activates a cryptic splice donor site, producing a truncated mutant protein termed "progerin." WT  We sought to use splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to produce a model of accelerated ageing by enhancing expression of progerin, translated from a mis-spliced lamin A gene (LMNA) transcript in human myogenic cells. HGPS arises from de novo mutations that activate a cryptic splice site in exon 11 of LMNA and result in progerin accumulation in tissues of mesodermal origin. Oligonucleotides that annealed within the 150 base region of exon 11 that is missing in the progerin transcript, as well as those that targeted the normal exon 11 donor site induced the LMNA Δ150 transcript, but most oligonucleotides also generated variable levels of LMNA transcript missing the entire exon 11. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, producing a truncated farnesylated protein called progerin. This devastating incurable accelerated aging disease is caused by a silent mutation in the LMNA gene that generates a truncated lamin A protein "progerin" that exerts profound cellular toxicity and organismal decline. Accumulation of a truncated farnesylated prelamin A form, called progerin, is a hallmark of the severe premature ageing syndrome, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder, caused by mutation in the gene encoding lamin A/C, which produces a truncated protein called progerin. Mutations in the lamin A/C gene that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome lead to expression of a truncated, permanently farnesylated prelamin A variant called progerin. HGPS is almost always caused by a de novo point mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA) that activates a cryptic splice donor site, producing a truncated mutant protein termed "progerin." We have proposed that miR-9-mediated regulation of prelamin A in the brain could explain the absence of primary neurological disease in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a genetic disease caused by the synthesis of an internally truncated form of farnesyl-prelamin A (progerin). In this disease the lamin A, a protein participating (with others lamins) in the formation of the nuclear lamina and implicated in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression, is present in a truncated version called progerin. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder because of a LMNA gene mutation that produces a mutant lamin A protein (progerin).  Progerin is a truncated form of lamin A. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its carboxyl terminus.

6277e52256bf9aee6f000009	What is the incubation period for COVID-19?	We find that the incubation period has a median of 8.50 days (95% confidence interval [CI] [7.22; 9.15]). The pooled mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.0 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-6.5) globally, 6.5 days (95% CI 6.1-6.9) in the mainland of China, and 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1-5.1) outside the mainland of China (P = 0.006). The incubation period varied with age (P = 0.005). Meanwhile, in 11 545 patients, the mean incubation period was 7.1 days (95% CI 7.0-7.2), which was similar to the finding in our meta-analysis. For COVID-19, the mean incubation period was 6.0 days globally but near 7.0 days in the mainland of China, which will help identify the time of infection and make disease control decisions. The mean incubation period ranged from 5.6 (95% CI: 5.2 to 6.0) to 6.7 days (95% CI: 6.0 to 7.4) according to the statistical model. The 95th percentile was 12.5 days when the mean age of patients was 60 years, increasing 1 day for every 10 years. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain. We estimated that the 0.95-th quantile related to people in the age group 23 ∼55 is less than 15 days. Based on the collected data, we found that the conditional quantiles of the incubation period distribution of COVID-19 vary by age. The estimated mean incubation period we obtain is 6.74 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 6.35 to 7.13), and the 90th percentile is 11.64 days (95% CI: 11.22 to 12.17), corresponding to a good agreement with statistical supported studies. The mean and median incubation period were of maximum 8 days and 12 days respectively. In various parametric models, the 95th percentiles were in the range 10.3-16 days. The highest 99th percentile would be as long as 20.4 days. The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2). This work provides additional evidence of incubation period for COVID-19 and showed that it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic. For COVID-19, average incubation period times commonly span 5-7 days which are generally longer than for most typical other respiratory viruses. Our estimated median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.4 days (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8-6.0), and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles are 1 and 15 days, respectively; while the estimated serial interval of COVID-19 falls within the range of -4 to 13 days with 95% confidence and has a median of 4.6 days (95% CI 3.7-5.5). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on published estimates of the incubation period distribution of COVID-19, and showed that the pooled median of the point estimates of the mean, median and 95 th percentile for incubation period are 6.3 days (range: 1.8 to 11.9 days), 5.4 days (range: 2.0 to 17.9 days) and 13.1 days (range: 3.2 to 17.8 days) respectively. The incubation period in COVID-19 (6.4 days estimated) was longer than influenza type A (3.4 days). Children (aged below 18 years) are susceptible to COVID-19, with an average incubation period of about 6.5 days. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. The median COVID-19 incubation period was 8.3 (90% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-9.2) days for all patients, 7.6 (90% CI, 6.7-8.6) days for younger adults, and 11.2 (90% CI, 9.0-13.5) days for older adults. This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days.	['5-7 days', '5 days', '6 days', '7 days']

These inhibitors include four Syk inhibitors, Bay 61-3606, R406 (fostamatinib), entospletinib, TAK-659; four irreversible BTK inhibitors, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, ONO-4059 (tirabrutinib), AVL-292 (spebrutinib); and four reversible BTK inhibitors, CG-806, BMS-935177, BMS-986195, and fenebrutinib.  However, an increasing number of trials instead addresses autoimmunity and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus with the use of either irreversibly binding inhibitors, e.g., evobrutinib and tolebrutinib, or reversibly binding inhibitors, like fenebrutinib.  OBJECTIVE: Fenebrutinib (GDC-0853) is a noncovalent, oral, and highly selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). In contrast, no bleeding has been reported in clinical trials of other BTKi. These include the brain-penetrant irreversible tolebrutinib and evobrutinib (against multiple sclerosis), the irreversible branebrutinib, the reversible BMS-986142 and fenebrutinib (targeting rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematodes), and the reversible covalent rilzabrutinib (against pemphigus and immune thrombocytopenia). Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is crucial for FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and essential for autoantibody production by B cells in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Fenebrutinib, an orally administered, potent, highly selective, reversible BTK inhibitor, may be effective in CSU.  New therapeutics under investigation include IgG1 anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies (ligelizumab), chemoattractant rector-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells antagonists (AZD1981), Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (fenebrutinib), anti-siglec-8 monoclonal antibody (AK002), and topical spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors (GSK2646264).

Report the outcomes of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for high myopia correction after long-term follow-up laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)  Currently laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is indicated to correct myopia of up to - 8 D, hyperopia up to + 3 D and astigmatism up to 5 D. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) are primarily recommended for myopia up to - 6 D and for greater refractive errors, phakic intraocular lenses (IOL) are the first choice (myopia greater than - 6 D and hyperopia greater than + 3 D). PURPOSE: Ectasia after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a rare but serious complication. BACKGROUND: Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is a new keratorefractive procedure for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism, which may combine advantages and eliminate disadvantages of photorefractive keratectomy (e.g. pain, corneal haze) and laser in situ keratomileusis (e.g. flap and interface complications, dry eye, keratecta Laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is a relatively new refractive surgical technique that purportedly combines the advantages of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

BACKGROUND: LASIK (Laser in situ keratomileusis) is used in refractive surgery especially for correction of higher degree LASEK (laser subepithelial keratomileusis). Laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is a relatively new refractive surgical technique that purportedly combines the advantages of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The incorporation of a microkeratome in 1990 finally led to laser in situ keratomileusis-LASIK-as we know it today.

In the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, specialized epithelial cells, the membranous (M) cells, sample antigenic matter from the gut lumen and bring it into contact with cells of the immune system, which are then capable of initiating specific immune reactions A strong clustering of lymphoid cells originating from either twin was seen in the ileal Peyer's patches (IPPs). he gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the largest immune organs in the body and contains multiple immune cells in the GIT-associated lymphoid tissue, Peyer's patches and elsewhere, which together have profound effects on local and systemic inflammation. The  During routine lower gastrointestinal endoscopy of children for suspected chronic inflammatory bowel disease, it is possible to visualize lymphoid follicles (Peyer's patches) in the last few centimeters of the terminal ileum. Bi ls responsible for local pIg production are initially stimulated in lymphoepithelial structures, particularly the Peyer's patches in the distal small intestine, from which they migrate as memory cells to exocrine tissues all over the body. Mucous mem During the course of their recirculation through the body, blood-borne lymphocytes specifically adhere to high endothelial venules (HEV) within secondary lymphoid organs such as peripheral lymph nodes (PN) and gut-associated Peyer's patches (PP). This this respect, Peyer's patches (PP), represent one of the most important immunological site of the body and the major component of the gut -associated lymphoid tissue. The a en-stimulated B and T lymphocytes are distributed from Peyer's patches and other gut-associated lymphoid tissue to exocrine glandular sites all over the body; this is the basis for local generation of SIgA antibodies with an enormous selection of specificities required for protection of the extensive mucosal surfaces.

The Peyer's patches have been considered an important structure of the gut associate lymphoid tissue (GALT) for the initiation of the immune response towards particulate or Peyer patches are the major entrance of Salmonella infection and antigen transportation in intestine. The early replication of certain prion strains within Peyer's patches in the small intestine is essential for the efficient spread of disease to the brain after oral exposure. Distribution of Peyer's patches in the distal ileum. The position of the Peyer's patches is unusual in that the first three Peyer's patches are on the right side of the small intestine whereas the penultimate and ultimate Peyer's patches are large, contain many lymphoid follicles and are in an anti-mesenteric position in the small intestine and sometimes in the large intestine (ultimate Peyer's patch). Peyer's patches in the small intestine are prominent, ranging from four to 13, and increase in size (surface area) with age. The jejunal Peyer's patches are devoid of CAP, persist in the adult animal, contain M cells with clusters of B cells in the follicle-associated epithelium, and have many CD4+ lymphocytes in the follicles and in the interfollicular areas. They were distributed in the whole small intestine and there were four distinct types of Peyer's patches: nodular, faviform, cup-shaped, and cystic form Peyer's patches.

Peyer's patches were counted, and the length, breadth, and distance from the ileocecal valve were recorded.RESULTS: Patches were most numerous in the terminal 10-1 Located in the small intestine, Peyer's patches (PP) are primary antigen sampling and mucosal immune response inductive sites. In this respect, Peyer's patches (PP), represent one of the most important immunological site of the body and the major component of the gut -associated lymphoid tissue. [Number and localization of Peyer's patches in the small intestine of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)]. In the rabbit intestine Peyer's patches can easily be distinguished. Peyer's patches are gut-associated lymphoid tissue located throughout the intestinal wall. Peyer's patches consist of highly organized ovoid-shaped follicles, classified as non-encapsulated lymphatic tissues, populated with B cells, T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and function as an organism's intestinal surveillance. Rats had a significantly reduced number of Peyer's patches in the duodenum in comparison to either the jejunum or ileum. In summary, the gene expression pattern of Peyer's patches is influenced by intestinal location and may contribute to its role in that segment. Limited work compares the gene profiles of Peyer's patches derived from different intestinal regions. Using samples obtained from additional subjects (n = 10), we validated the novel gene expression patterns in Peyer's patches obtained from the three regions of the small intestine. In the current study, we first performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq to compare duodenal and ileal Peyer's patches obtained from the small intestine of Long Evans rats.

Circular RNAs (circRNA) have been reported as regulators involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their mechanism of activity remains unknown.  Recent technological advances in RNA sequencing and analysis have allowed an increasingly thorough investigation of a previously unexplored class of transcripts, circular (circ)RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that circRNAs have unique functions which often rely on their association with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Through these interactions, circRNAs have been implicated in major cellular processes and hence in the pathophysiology of a range of diseases.

602357ff1cb411341a00009a	What treatment was studied in the KEYNOTE-522 trial?	The phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial now shows that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improves pathological complete response rates regardless of PD-L1 status and appears to improve survival. Whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would significantly increase the percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer who have a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery is unclear.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (784 patients; the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (390 patients; the placebo-chemotherapy group); the two groups then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo, and both groups received doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, the percentage with a pathological complete response was significantly higher among those who received pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy than among those who received placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme [a subsidiary of Merck]; KEYNOTE-522 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03036488.).

6251a2ffe764a5320400001c	What is the function of the protein SLC26A5?	SLC26A5 transporter prestin is fundamental for the higher hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammals. Prestin is a voltage-dependent transporter found in the cochlear outer hair cells responsible for their electromotility.  The outer hair cell (OHC) membrane harbors a voltage-dependent protein, prestin (SLC26a5), in high density, whose charge movement is evidenced as a nonlinear capacitance (NLC). Prestin (SLC26A5) is responsible for acute sensitivity and frequency selectivity in the vertebrate auditory system. The voltage-dependent motor protein prestin (also known as SLC26A5) is responsible for the electromotive behaviour of outer-hair cells and underlies the cochlear amplifier1.

6221209b3a8413c653000074	Proteins in the karyopherin family (Kaps) are associated with what cellular process?	Nuclear translocation of large proteins is mediated through specific protein carriers, collectively named karyopherins (importins, exportins and adaptor proteins). Karyopherins mediate the macromolecular transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and participate in cancer progression. Transportin-1 (Trn1), also known as karyopherin-β2 (Kapβ2), is probably the best-characterized nuclear import receptor of the karyopherin-β family after Importin-β Karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), a member of the nuclear transporter family, is elevated in multiple human cancers and accelerates carcinogenesis. Nuclear import of proteins relies on nuclear import receptors called importins/karyopherins (Kaps), whose functions were reported in yeasts, fungi, plants, and animal cells, including cell cycle control, morphogenesis, stress sensing/response, and also fungal pathogenecity.  In eukaryotic cells, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules is largely mediated by Karyopherin β/Importin (KPNβ or Impβ) nuclear transport factors, and they import and export cargo proteins or RNAs via the nuclear pores across the nuclear envelope, consequently effecting the cellular signal cascades in response to pathogen attack and environmental cues.  The nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of these proteins is controlled by proteins in the karyopherin family of nuclear transport factors (Kaps). We show here that the import of histone H2A and H2B is mediated by several members of the karyopherin (Kap; importin) family. Small molecules can freely exchange through the NPC, but macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa must be aided across by transport factors, most of which belong to a related family of proteins termed karyopherins (Kaps). Exportin-5, a novel karyopherin, mediates nuclear export of double-stranded RNA binding proteins. We show here that nuclear import of TBP is mediated by a new karyopherin (Kap) (importin) family member, Kap114p. The karyopherin (Kap) family of nuclear transport factors facilitates macromolecular transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). ear-cytoplasmic distribution of these proteins is controlled by proteins in the karyopherin family of nuclear transport factors (Kaps). Recent Human karyopherin alpha2 (KPNA2), a member of the karyopherin alpha family, plays a key role in the nuclear import of proteins with a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS). K ystematically manipulating the amounts, types, and affinities of Kaps and cargos, we show that import rates in vivo are simply governed by the concentrations of Kaps and their cargo and the affinity between them. These Proteins in the karyopherin-β family mediate the majority of macromolecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The alpha- and beta-karyopherins (Kaps), also called importins, mediate the nuclear transport of proteins. Karyopherins interact with nucleoporins, proteins that form the nuclear pore complex, to promote the translocation of their cargos into the nucleus. Studies have also suggested that karyopherins might participate in histones deposition into nucleosomes. When binding to histones, karyopherins not only function as nuclear import receptors but also as chaperones, protecting histones from non-specific interactions in the cytoplasm, in the nuclear pore and possibly in the nucleus. In yeast there are at least 14 members of the beta-karyopherin protein family that govern the movement of a diverse set of cargoes between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The Karyopherin proteins are involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and are critical for protein and RNA subcellular localization. The Karyopherin (Kap) family of nuclear transport receptors enables trafficking of proteins to and from the nucleus in a precise, regulated manner. The Karyopherin proteins, Crm1 and Karyopherin beta1, are overexpressed in cervical cancer and are critical for cancer cell survival and proliferation. BACKGROUND: Karyopherin α-2 (KPNA2) is a member of karyopherin family, which is proved to be responsible for the import or export of cargo proteins.	['nuclear transport']

621ecac13a8413c65300005f	What is the mode of action of primaquine?	Primaquine (PQ) not only eliminates P. falciparum gametocytes but also kills liver dormant forms of P. vivax and P. ovale.  The effect of primaquine in preventing P. vivax relapses from dormant stages is well established. the wide use of PQ to treat liver-stage malaria.  Primaquine (PQ) is one of the most widely used antimalarial drugs.  Low-dose primaquine is recommended to prevent Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission Four amphipathic drugs, primaquine, propranolol, chlorpromazine and tetracaine, were used to cause endocytosis in glucose-depleted red cells, and the relative reduction of membrane surfaces was measured by the toluidine blue (TB) method. This pattern of inhibition of macromolecular biosyntheses suggests that the major in vivo action of primaquine in B. megaterium is to block protein synthesis.

5fe31316a43ad31278000043	What induces downstream of gene (DoG) readthrough transcription?	Readthrough activation of early adenovirus E1b gene transcription Using the rigorous methodology Cap-Seq, we demonstrated that DoGs result from transcriptional readthrough, not de novo initiation.  Rather it is, as we originally demonstrated, transcriptional readthrough that leads to the formation of DoGs. Previous studies demonstrated that massive induction of transcriptional readthrough generates downstream of gene-containing transcripts (DoGs) in cells under stress condition  Importantly, Ca2+ signaling mediates reduced transcription termination in response to certain stress conditions. This reduction allows readthrough transcription, generating a highly inducible and diverse class of downstream of gene containing transcripts (DoGs) that we have recently described. Finally, we examine genomic features of readthrough transcription and observe a unique chromatin signature typical of DoG-producing regions, suggesting that readthrough transcription is associated with the maintenance of an open chromatin state. We recently discovered that stress-induced transcriptional readthrough generates very long downstream of gene containing transcripts (DoGs), which may explain up to 20% of intergenic transcription. DoGs are induced by osmotic stress at the level of transcription by a mechanism that depends on calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by IP3 receptors.  Furthermore, the readthrough response to stress has thus far not been investigated outside of mammalian species, and the occurrence of readthrough in many physiological and disease conditions remains to be explored We further demonstrate the use of the DoGFinder software package on a new publically available RNA-seq dataset, and discover DoG induction in human PME cells following hypoxia - a previously unknown readthrough inducing stress type.

62005c68c9dfcb9c09000017	Which tool has been developed for annotation of Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits of G-proteins?	GprotPRED: Annotation of Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits of G-proteins using profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) and application to proteomes. An online tool, GprotPRED, was developed that uses these six pHMMs. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the Gβ case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%. In contrast to Pfam's pHMM which detects Gα subunits in general, our method not only detects Gα subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate Gα-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes.

603534671cb411341a000153	What is the msDNA?	 msDNA is actually a complex of DNA, RNA, and probably protein. It is composed of a small, single-stranded DNA, linked to a small, single-stranded RNA molecule. The 5' end of the DNA molecule is joined to an internal guanosine residue of the RNA molecule by a unique 2'-5' phosphodiester bond. msDNA is produced in many hundreds of copies per cell, but its function remains unknown.  Retron is a prokaryotic genetic element that produces multicopy single-stranded DNA covalently linked to RNA (msDNA) by a reverse transcriptase. msDNAs are small, structurally unique satellite DNAs found in a number of Gram-negative bacteria. Composed of hundreds of copies of single-stranded DNA--hence the name multicopy single-stranded DNA--msDNA is actually a complex of DNA, RNA, and probably protein.

6028f5851cb411341a0000ff	What is the prevalence of the inactivating AKT variant p.Pro50Thr in the Finnish population?	To identify novel coding association signals and facilitate characterization of mechanisms influencing glycemic traits and type 2 diabetes risk, we analyzed 109,215 variants derived from exome array genotyping together with an additional 390,225 variants from exome sequence in up to 39,339 normoglycemic individuals from five ancestry groups. We identified a novel association between the coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) in AKT2 and fasting plasma insulin (FI), a gene in which rare fully penetrant mutations are causal for monogenic glycemic disorders. The low-frequency allele is associated with a 12% increase in FI levels. This variant is present at 1.1% frequency in Finns but virtually absent in individuals from other ancestries. Carriers of the FI-increasing allele had increased 2-h insulin values, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.05). In cellular studies, the AKT2-Thr50 protein exhibited a partial loss of function. We extend the allelic spectrum for coding variants in AKT2 associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and demonstrate bidirectional effects of variants within the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT2.

5eb422150d431b5f73000009	Which was the first species in which a de novo gene emergence ("gene birth") was reported?	de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or 'non-genic' sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions. Testing this model at the genome scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences.  We identify ~1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication Although the origin of such "orphan" genes remains unclear, they are thought to be involved in species-specific adaptive processes. Here, we analyzed seven orphan genes (MoSPC1 to MoSPC7) prioritized based on in planta expressed sequence tag data in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Based on these results, the four orphan genes may be products of de novo gene birth processes, and their adaptive potential is in the course of being tested for retention or extinction through natural selection. NCYM is the first de novo evolved protein known to act as an oncopromoting factor in human cancer, and suggest that de novo evolved proteins may functionally characterize human disease. De novo gene-birth contributes to shorter exons, longer introns, and higher exon-density in species-specific genes relative to conserved genes. The phenomenon of de novo gene birth from junk DNA is surprising, because random polypeptides are expected to be toxic. These targets regulated diverse biological processes including nutrient sensing and the DNA damage response, and implicated Vts1 in de novo gene "birth." Many modern analysis pipelines use significant sequence similarity scores (p- or E-values) and the ranked order of BLAST matches to test a wide range of hypotheses concerning homology, orthology, the timing of de novo gene birth/death and gene family The Majority of Novel Protein-Coding Genes Identified with Phylostratigraphy Are Old Genes or Recent Duplicates. Using a combination of synteny information and sequence similarity searches, I show that ∼60% of the remaining 381 putative de novo genes share homology with genes from other vertebrates, originated through gene duplication, and/or share no synteny information with nonrodent mammals. We find hundreds of open reading frames that are translated and that show no evolutionary conservation or selective constraints.  The AQP2 gene consists of four exons, but the alternative AQP2 gene lacks the fourth exon and instead has a longer third exon that includes the original third exon and a part of the original third intron. Nonetheless we identified 35 de novo genes: 16 human-specific; 5 human and chimpanzee specific; and 14 that originated prior to the divergence of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla and are found in all three genomes De novo gene evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins in codfishes revealed by whole genome sequence data. New genes can arise through duplication of a pre-existing gene or de novo from non-coding DNA, providing raw material for evolution of new functions in response to a changing environment. A prime example is the independent evolution of antifreeze glycoprotein genes (afgps) in the Arctic codfishes and Antarctic notothenioids to prevent freezing.	['the Arctic codfish']

62211ebc3a8413c653000071	What is the purpose of  Macropinocytosis?	Macropinocytosis defines a series of events initiated by extensive plasma membrane reorganization or ruffling to form an external macropinocytic structure that is then enclosed and internalized.  Macropinocytosis is a form of endocytosis that accompanies cell surface ruffling. Modified LDLs are internalized by macrophages in part via macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis results from the closure of lamellipodia generated by membrane ruffling, thereby reflecting cortical actin dynamics.  Gonococcal entry into primary human urethral epithelial cells (HUEC) can occur by macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis as a mechanism of entry into primary human urethral epithelial cells by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Macropinocytosis is a normal cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular fluids and nutrients from their environment and is one strategy that Ras-transformed pancreatic cancer cells use to increase uptake of amino acids to meet the needs of rapid growth Macropinocytosis is a regulated form of endocytosis that mediates the nonselective uptake of nutrients to support growth under nutrient-deprived conditions Macropinocytosis is an ancient mechanism that allows cells to harvest nutrients from extracellular media, which also allows immune cells to sample antigens from their surroundings. Macropinocytosis refers to the non-specific uptake of extracellular fluid, which plays ubiquitous roles in cell growth, immune surveillance, and virus entry. D Macropinocytosis has emerged as an important nutrient supply pathway that sustains cell growth of cancer cells within the nutrient-poor tumor microenvironment Macropinocytosis is a prevalent and essential pathway in macrophages where it contributes to anti-microbial responses and innate immune cell functions Macropinocytosis is an actin-driven process of large-scale and non-specific fluid uptake used for feeding by some cancer cells and the macropinocytosis model organism Dictyostelium discoideum In Dictyostelium, macropinocytic cups are organized by 'macropin Macropinocytosis-the large-scale, non-specific uptake of fluid by cells-is used by Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae to obtain nutrients. Macropinocytosis has received increasing attention in recent years for its various roles in nutrient acquisition, immune surveillance, and virus and cancer pathologies.  Macropinocytosis is an evolutionarily-conserved, large-scale, fluid-phase form of endocytosis that has been ascribed different functions including antigen presentation in macrophages and dendritic cells, regulation of receptor density in neurons, and regulation of tumor growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. Macropinocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of endocytosis that mediates non-selective uptake of extracellular fluid and the solutes contained therein. The primary function of macropinocytosis in amoebae and some cancer cells is feeding, but the conserved processing pathway for macropinosomes, which involves shrinkage and the retrieval of membrane to the cell surface, has been adapted in immune cells for antigen presentation. Macropinocytosis is induced by many pathogens to enter host cells, but other functions for macropinocytosis in virus replication are unknown. Macropinocytosis is a means by which eukaryotic cells ingest extracellular liquid and dissolved molecules. Macropinocytosis is the endocytic pathway that mediates macrophage foam cell formation with native low density lipoprotein. Macropinocytosis refers to the formation of primary large endocytic vesicles of irregular size and shape, generated by actin-driven evaginations of the plasma membrane, whereby cells avidly incorporate extracellular fluid. Macropinocytosis is exploited by many pathogens for entry into cells. This suggests that macropinocytosis is necessary for mTORC1-dependent growth of metazoan cells, both as a route for delivery of amino acids to sensors associated with lysosomes and as a platform for growth factor-dependent signalling to mTORC1 via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Akt pathway. Macropinocytosis is a form of endocytosis which provides an effective way for non-selective uptakes of extracellular proteins, liquids, and particles. Macropinocytosis is important in a range of physiological processes, including antigen presentation, nutrient sensing, recycling of plasma proteins, migration and signalling. Macropinocytosis is increasingly recognized for its versatile adaptations and functions as a highly conserved, ubiquitous pathway for the bulk uptake of fluid, particulate cargo, and membranes. In tumour cells, macropinocytosis functions as an amino acid supply route and supports cancer cell survival and proliferation. Macropinocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic pathway that permits the internalization of extracellular fluid via large endocytic vesicles known as macropinosomes. Recently, macropinocytosis has been determined to function as a nutrient-scavenging pathway in Ras-driven cancer cells.	['transport across an external cell membrane']
606b2b1994d57fd87900005c	What is the cause of lactose intolerance?	Lactose intolerance is a common condition caused by lactase deficiency and may result in symptoms of lactose malabsorption (bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and change in bowel habits).   Adult lactose intolerance (ALI) significantly alters calcium intake and absorption, and thus may promote osteoporosis. ALI is a recessive condition with a geographical north-south gradient characterised by decreased levels of intestinal lactase. Considerations include recognizing that a substantial proportion of the world's adult population (65%-70%) exhibits lactase nonpersistence, a reduced ability to metabolize lactose to glucose and galactose.  Four clinical subtypes of lactose intolerance may be distinguished, namely lactase deficiency in premature infants, congenital lactase deficiency, adult-type hypolactasia and secondary lactase intolerance. Lactose intolerance (LI) is characterized by the presence of primarily gastrointestinal clinical signs resulting from colonic fermentation of lactose, the absorption of which is impaired due to a deficiency in the lactase enzyme. These clinical signs can be modified by several factors, including lactose dose, residual lactase expression, concurrent ingestion of other dietary components, gut-transit time, and enteric microbiome composition.

623dfd2ef0baec9a1b000004	What is the function of the protein calreticulin?	Subsequently, the N-glycosylated nascent proteins enter the folding step, in which N-glycans contribute largely to attaining the correct protein fold by recruiting the lectin-like chaperones, calnexin, and calreticulin.  The lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum play important roles in glycoprotein quality control.  Calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein generally overexpressed in cancer cells, is associated with radiation resistance. Calreticulin (CALR) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in a spectrum of cellular processes. In healthy cells, CALR operates as a chaperone and Ca2+ buffer to assist correct protein folding within the ER.	['chaperone and Ca2+ buffer to assist correct protein folding within the ER']

621fcaf93a8413c653000065	What is the function of the protein encoded by PUMILIO1?	Human Pumilio (hPUM) is a structurally well-analyzed RNA-binding protein that has been used recently for artificial RNA binding. A family of RBPs, which is known as the Pumilio-FBF (PUF) family, is highly conserved among different species and has been associated with the undifferentiated and differentiated states of different cell lines  The RNA-binding domains of Pumilio/fem-3 mRNA binding factors (PUF domains) are programmable RNA binding scaffolds used to engineer artificial proteins that specifically modulate RNAs Pumilio is a member of the highly conserved PUF family of RNA-binding proteins that function as a developmental regulator in diverse animal species.  Pumilio1 (Pum1) has been shown to play key roles in translational regulation of target mRNAs in many systems of diverse organisms.  Human PUMILIO1 (PUM1) and PUMILIO2 (PUM2) are members of the PUMILIO/FBF (PUF) family that regulate specific target mRNAs posttranscriptionally. We previously showed that Pumilio1 (Pum1) is specifically involved in the translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA during Xenopus oocyte maturation, in cooperation with cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB). Seeking to understand how post-translational modification of ATAXIN1 levels influences disease, we discovered that the RNA-binding protein PUMILIO1 (PUM1) not only directly regulates ATAXIN1 but also plays an unexpectedly important role in neuronal function. ilio-1 (PUM1) is an RNA binding protein whose regulatory role is by binding to the consensus 5'UGUANAUA3' sequence on the 3'UTR of the mRNA targets and post-transcriptionally repressing their expression. This stu ighly conserved RNA-binding protein Pumilio-1 (PUM1) regulates mouse growth and cell proliferation, propelling us to examine its role in cancer.

Because of its h Pumilio is a member of the highly conserved PUF family of RNA-binding proteins that function as a developmental regulator in diverse animal species. Mouse PUMILIO1 (PUM1) and PUMILIO2 (PUM2) belong to the PUF (Pumilio/FBF) family, a highly conserved RNA binding protein family whose homologues play critical roles in embryonic development and germ line stem cell maintenance in invertebrates. Although the pumilio protein regulates the reproductive organ development in many species, its role in Schistosoma japonicum is unknown. Two Pumilio genes, Pum1 and Pum2, have been identified in mammals and are found to be involved in sperm development, neuron development as well as human diseases such as neurodegeneration. These data show that Pumilio1 can be used as a scaffold to engineer RNA-binding proteins with designed sequence specificity. To understand the role of these proteins in human ESCs (hESCs), we first assessed the influence of the silencing of PUM1 and PUM2 on pluripotency genes and found that the knockdown of Pumilio genes significantly decreased the OCT4 and NANOG mRNA levels and reduced the amount of nuclear OCT4, which suggests that Pumilio proteins play a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in hESCs.

Mac Although M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as a vital therapeutic target in cancer therapy due to their role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis, very few compounds have been identified to inhibit M2-like polarization of TAMs. H Eliciting effective antitumor immune responses in patients who fail checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a critical challenge in cancer immunotherapy, and in such patients, tumor-associated myeloid cells and macrophages (TAMs) are promising therapeutic targets. We As CSCs depend on their specific niche, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), elucidating the network between CSCs and TAMs may help to effectively inhibit the progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer.Experimental Design: The underlying intracellular mechanism that sustains the stem-like characteristics of CSCs in prostate cancer was assessed via RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other assays. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy, while TAMs targeting therapy using nano-sized drug delivery system (NDDS) is a great challenge. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial part in cancer evolution. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of M2 phenotype have mediated the immunosuppression in a tumor microenvironment, facilitating the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. In this review, we outline the importance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to cancer therapy. In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant leucocyte subset in many cancers and play a major role in the creation of a protective niche for tumor cells. These cells, known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play complex but pivotal roles in the outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignant lesions.

6277de0d56bf9aee6f000006	What is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis?	The initial MRI was strongly suggestive of MS in 19 of these (68%), while 27 (96%) had at least one MS-like abnormality in the initial MRI. These results support previous conclusions that MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting white matter asymptomatic lesions, and the most predictive for the diagnosis of CDMS. The most sensitive test was MRI (93%) followed by VEP (83%) and BAEP (60%) and the sensitivity of the study with high resolution CT including 59 patients explored by double enhancement and delayed cut off was very low (33%).  In diagnosis, MRI is the most sensitive test for the demonstration of dissemination of lesions in space. MRI also is a reliable measure of the extent of the MS process, serial MRI scans detect evidence of disease activity in MS not always disclosed by clinical evaluation. These results indicate that the presence of oligoclonal bands provides sensitive supporting evidence for the diagnosis of MS but that bands may be present in other disorders, including those not directly related to infection or abnormal immune response. The data suggest that oligoclonal bands may represent an immune response to neurological injury that is prominent in disorders with a particularly intense or continuous antigenic stimulus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently been recognised as the most sensitive method with which to detect clinically silent lesions in patients affected by multiple sclerosis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive paraclinical test for diagnosis and assessment of disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) and is often used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

Acute cauda equina syndrome secondary to a lumbar synovial cyst INTRODUCTION: Schwannoma is a relatively common benign spinal cord and/or cauda equina tumor; however, giant cauda equina schwannoma with extensive scalloping of the lumbar vertebral body is a rare pathology, and the treatment strategy, including the use of surgical procedures, is controversial. In this report, we present a rare case of a giant lumbar schwannoma of the cauda equina with extremely large scalloping of the vertebral body, and we discuss the surgical strategy we used to treat this pathology. In contrast, the caudal cord of Rana is reduced to a filum terminale consisting of little more than an ependymal tube; spinal nerves to all caudal myotomes leave the cord in the sacral region and reach their motor targets via a cauda equina and caudal plexus. The spinal cords of other teleosts, the sun-fish and angler, also are abbreviated and possess a filum terminale and cauda equina. Penetrating spinal cord injury with foreign body included or myelography stop or showing cauda equina syndrome should be operated on. Cauda Equina Conduction Time Determined by F-Waves in Normal Subjects and Patients With Neurogenic Intermittent Claudication Caused by Lumbar Spinal Stenosis After spinal cord injury, electrical stimulation of the roots inside the spinal column at the level of the cauda equina is a safe and effective way to regain some degree of control over lower body function, e.g. bladder and bowel management and leg movement.

Cauda equina syndrome refers to dysfunction of the cauda equina, the collection of ventral and dorsal lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerve roots that surround the filum terminale. The involvement of intrinsic spinal cord neurons in the compression-induced cauda equina syndrome includes anterograde, retrograde and transneuronal degeneration in the lumbosacral segments. Single or double-level compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots located in the dural sac results in a polyradicular symptomatology clinically diagnosed as cauda equina syndrome. The cauda equina is an anatomic structure located in the lower part of the spinal canal consisting of multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots.	['spine']

Encouragingly, the KRASG12C inhibitor AMG510 (sotorasib), which has been approved for treating NSCLC and CRC recently, makes directly targeting KRAS the most promising strategy for cancer therapy.  Finally, we show that a selective PI4KA inhibitor augments the antineoplastic activity of the KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib, suggesting a clinical path to exploit this pathway.  However, clinical candidates targeting the KRAS G12C protein have recently been developed. MRTX849 and recently approved Sotorasib are covalent binders targeting the mutated cysteine 12, occupying Switch II pocket. Sotorasib with efficacy in kRAS-G12C mutation of NSCLC Two such inhibitors, sotorasib (AMG 510) and adagrasib (MRTX849), were recently evaluated in phase I-III trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS-G12C mutations, heralding a new era of precision oncology.  The findings, along with data on the KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib, were presented at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress. The FDA has approved the first KRAS-targeted therapy, sotorasib, for patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer with KRASG12C mutations. In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Sotorasib (Lumakras) for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS-G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, following at least one prior systemic therapy. The KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib continues to impress in non-small cell lung cancer: In the phase II CodeBreak 100 trial, the agent elicited responses in more than a third of patients and led to a median progression-free survival of almost 7 months. Based on these result Sotorasib is a first-in-class small molecule that irreversibly inhibits KRAS G12C, locking it in an inactive state, inhibiting oncogenic signaling, and inducing a proinflammatory microenvironment. Sotorasib is a first-in class KRASG12C covalent inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of tumors with the KRAS p.G12C mutation. In the nonclinical to Recently, novel KRAS G12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, are being developed in clinical trials and have revealed promising results in metastatic NSCLC. We evaluated the clinical validity of Guardant360 CDx as a companion diagnostic for sotorasib for detection of KRAS p.G12C, an important oncogenic NSCLC driver mutation. Until the recent approval of sotorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, lack of targeted therapy for KRAS has resulted in poor prognosis of patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations.

Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for the protein progranulin (PGRN), GRN, are one of the major genetic abnormalities involved in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Numerous kindreds with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration have been linked to mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or progranulin (GRN) genes. BACKGROUND: Progranulin protein (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich growth factor encoded by the progranulin gene (GRN). Due to the highly diverse biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple possible disease mechanisms have been proposed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMEM106B encoding the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B increase the risk for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) of GRN (progranulin gene) mutation carriers. BACKGROUND: Progranulin protein (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich growth factor encoded by the progranulin  GRN, the gene coding for the progranulin (PGRN) protein, was recognized as a gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Th Progranulin (PGRN) is a protein encoded by the GRN gene with multiple identified functions including as a neurotrophic factor, tumorigenic growth factor, anti-inflammatory cytokine and regulator of lysosomal function. A  Mutations in the GRN gene coding for progranulin (PGRN) are responsible for many cases of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP). GRN ozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Gene t ne of these genes (GRN), which encodes progranulin, have been implicated in up to a quarter of cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43)-positive inclusions; currently, there are more than 60 known pathogenic mutations of the gene. We present the cl Mutation in the GRN gene, encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein, shows a dose-dependent disease correlation, wherein haploinsufficiency results in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and complete loss results in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Altho e on FTD caused by mutations in the GRN gene, which encodes a secreted protein, progranulin (PGRN), that has diverse roles in regulating cell survival, immune responses, and autophagy and lysosome function in the brain. FTD-linked mutat to the highly diverse biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple possible disease mechanisms have been proposed. Early   most common pathological subtype, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein with a molecular weight of 43 kDa inclusions (FTLD-TDP), is often caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) encoding the progranulin protein (PGRN). GRN pa Progranulin, a secreted glycoprotein, is encoded in humans by the single GRN gene. Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene, encoding progranulin (PGRN), cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD), respectively. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Progranulin (PGRN) is a protein encoded by the GRN gene with multiple identified functions including as a neurotrophic factor, tumorigenic growth factor, anti-inflammatory cytokine and regulator of lysosomal function. BACKGROUND: Progranulin (PGRN) encoded by the GRN gene, is a secreted glycoprotein growth factor that has been implicated in many physiological and pathophysiologica Progranulin (PGRN), encoded by the GRN gene in humans, is a secreted growth factor implicated in a multitude of processes ranging from regulation of inflammation to wound healing and tumorigenesis. Mutation in the GRN gene, encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein, shows a dose-dependent disease correlation, wherein haploinsufficiency results in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and complete loss results in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). We focus here on FTD caused by mutations in the GRN gene, which encodes a secreted protein, progranulin (PGRN), that has diverse roles in regulating cell survival, immune responses, and autophagy and lysosome function in the brain. By studying mice lacking progranulin (PGRN), the protein encoded by GRN, we discovered multiple lines of evidence that PGRN deficiency results in impairment of autophagy, a key cellular degradation pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN), which encodes progranulin (PGRN), are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The recent discovery that mutations in the gene encoding for progranulin (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia, has brought renewed interest in progranulin and its functions in the central nervous system.

625ebf76e764a53204000033	What is the most frequent evolution (next stage) when Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is not treated?	We consider that IMH may represent a part of a disease (aortic dissection), depicted by radiological images in a specific single instant of its clinical evolution. IMH may progress to classic dissection, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed.  Type B acute aortic dissection (AAD) and intramural hematoma (IMH) can both present as potentially catastrophic lesions of the descending aorta. IMH is distinguished from AAD by the absence of an intimal tear and flap. With short-term outcomes being similar to type B AAD, IMH is treated identically to AAD in the corresponding segment of the aorta. Intramural hematomas (IMHs) are reported to dynamically evolve into different clinical outcomes ranging from regression to aortic rupture,   IMH displays a typical of dissection progress, and could be considered as a precursor of classic aortic dissection.  Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) evolves very dynamically in the short-term to regression, dissection, or aortic rupture Intramural hematoma of the aorta is a condition increasingly observed in clinical practice. Uncertainty exists whether such lesions represent a different pathology or simply the precursors of classic dissecting aneurysm We stress that intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta has to be managed as an aortic type A dissection and that aggressive treatment is advisable. BACKGROUND: Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) evolves very dynamically in the short-term to regression, dissection, or aortic rupture. LUSIONS: The most frequent long-term evolution of IMH is to aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Com IMH also frequently leads to aortic emergency, which can be fatal unless rapidly diagnosed and treated. Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is an acute, potentially lethal disorder that is similar to but pathologically distinct from acute aortic dissection.

627a875a56bf9aee6f000023	What causes the "worst headache" of a patient's life?	Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with a mortality of more than 30%. Acute, severe headache, typically described as the worst headache of the patient's life, and meningismus are the characteristic manifestations of SAH. Computed tomog raphy (CT) reveals blood in the basal cisterns in the first 12 hours after SAH with approximately 95% sensitivity and specificity. If no blood is seen on CT, a lumbar puncture must be performed to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of SAH. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a neurological emergency with high risk of neurological decline and death. Although the presentation of a thunderclap headache or the worst headache of a patient's life easily triggers the evaluation for SAH, subtle presentations are still missed. The gold standard for diagnostic evaluation of SAH remains noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) followed by lumbar puncture if the CT is negative for SAH. Headache is the most common presenting symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), ranging from mild headache to the "worst headache of my life". Patients who survive an Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage or ASAH describe it as being the worst headache ever, multiplied one hundred-times over.

6202f600c9dfcb9c0900002b	Which JASPAR release is JASPAR 2022?	JASPAR 2022: the 9th release of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles. JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) is an open-access database containing manually curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles for TFs across six taxonomic groups. In this 9th release, we expanded the CORE collection with 341 new profiles (148 for plants, 101 for vertebrates, 85 for urochordates, and 7 for insects), which corresponds to a 19% expansion over the previous release. We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of DNA binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each TF. We updated the genome tracks of TFBSs predicted with JASPAR profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse TFBS predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform JASPAR TFBS enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions. All the data is accessible through the JASPAR website, its associated RESTful API, the R/Bioconductor data package, and a new Python package, pyJASPAR, that facilitates serverless access to the data.

6020a8431cb411341a00007f	Which CD38 antibody has been shown to be effective for Lupus Erythematosus?	Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab in Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Daratumumab, a human monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, depletes plasma cells and is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Long-lived plasma cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus because they secrete autoantibodies, but they are unresponsive to standard immunosuppression. We describe the use of daratumumab that induced substantial clinical responses in two patients with life-threatening lupus, with the clinical responses sustained by maintenance therapy with belimumab, an antibody to B-cell activating factor.  This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of targeting CD38 as a plasma cell/plasmablast depletion mechanism by daratumumab in the treatment of patients with RA and SLE. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that CD38 may be a potential target for RA disease interception and daratumumab should be evaluated clinically for the treatment of both RA and SLE.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.  If approved, tebentafusp could become the standard of care for metastatic uveal melanoma-but only for those patients with a particular HLA allele. Recently, a randomized phase III trial reported an overall survival benefit for tebentafusp in patients with untreated metastatic uveal melanoma. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize evidence of Gp-100 as a therapeutic target in melanoma, and the preclinical and clinical development of tebentafusp as a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with uveal melanoma. Although UM metastases are less responsive than cutaneous melanoma to chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors, encouraging results have been reported with partial hepatectomy for solitary metastases, with percutaneous hepatic perfusion with melphalan or with tebentafusp. Several alternative systemic therapeutic approaches have been or are currently being investigated, including two agents that have been taken into registration-intent clinical trials: tebentafusp, a T cell redirecting agent, and IDE196, an oral protein kinase C inhibitor.
