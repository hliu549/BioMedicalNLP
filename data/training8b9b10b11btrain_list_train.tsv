553fa78b1d53b76422000007	Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?	Finally, five promising differentially miRNAs (miR-200a, miR-100, miR-141, miR-200b, and miR-200c) were reported with the consistent direction in four or more studies. MiR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-141, all of them belong to miR-200 family, were reported with consistently up-regulated in at least 4 studies, whereas miR-100 was reported with down-regulated in 4 studies Upregulation of microRNA-203 is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer multivariate analysis showed that the status of miR-203 expression was an independent predictor for both overall survival and progression-free survival in EOC. These findings provide the convincing evidence for the first time that the upregulation of miR-203 may serve as a novel molecular marker to predict the aggressive tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis of EOC patients Some, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissues There was a significantly positive correlation between miR-200a and E-cadherin in EOC. The biphasic expression pattern suggested that miR-200a levels may serve as novel biomarkers for the early detection of EOC, and miR-200a and E-cadherin are candidate targets for the development of new treatment modalities against ovarian cancer Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that miRNAs may play a role in the progression of OSC, and miR-510 and miR-509-5p may be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results In this study, we examined serum miR-21 levels in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, and explored its association with clinicopathological factors and prognosis. The results showed significantly higher serum miR-21 levels in EOC patients than in healthy controls. In addition, increased serum miR-21 expression was correlated with advanced FIGO stage, high tumor grade, and shortened overall survival. These findings indicate that serum miR-21 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker, and be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of EOC Identification of serum microRNA-21 as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in human epithelial ovarian cancer Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR  microRNA (miR)-182, miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-200c were highly overexpressed in the SEOC cell lines relative to normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells and were assessed in RNA extracted from serum as candidate biomarkers Together, these results suggest that low miR-100 expression             may be an independent poor prognostic factor and miR-100 can function as a tumor             suppressor by targeting PLK1 in human EOCs Prognostic implications of microRNA-100 and its functional roles in             human epithelial ovarian cancer Taken together, miR-152 and miR-148a may be involved             in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer through deregulation of cell proliferation.             They may be novel biomarkers for early detection or therapeutic targets of ovarian             cancer MicroRNA let-7a: a potential marker for selection of paclitaxel in ovarian cancer management  The study suggests that the beneficial impact of the addition of paclitaxel on EOC survival was significantly linked to let-7a levels, and that miRNAs such as let-7a may be a useful marker for selection of chemotherapeutic agents in EOC management miR-200c has potential as a predictor of survival, and is a biomarker of relapse, in stage I EOC MicroRNA microarray identifies Let-7i as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in human epithelial ovarian cancer  our results strongly suggest that let-7i might be used as a therapeutic target to modulate platinum-based chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and survival in patients with ovarian cancer miRNAs-21, 92 and 93 are known oncogenes with therapeutic and biomarker potential Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer	[['let-7a'], ['let-7b'], ['let-7i'], ['miR-21'], ['miR-26a'], ['miR-92'], ['miR-93'], ['miR-100'], ['miR-132'], ['miR-141'], ['miR-145'], ['miR-148a'], ['miR-152'], ['miR-182'], ['miR-200a'], ['miR-200b'], ['miR-200c'], ['miR-203'], ['miR-509-5p'], ['miR-510']]
5149199dd24251bc05000040	Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?	Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. For more than 50 years the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide has been the drug of choice in the symptomatic therapy for myasthenia gravis.  The switch to SR-Pyr ameliorated the total quantified myasthenia gravis (QMG) score from 0.9 ± 0.5 to 0.6 ± 0.4 (p<0.001) in all patients and in the younger subgroup. This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the quality of life parameters. The health status valued by EuroQoL questionnaire improved from 0.626 ± 0.286 to 0.782 ± 0.186 (p<0.001).  Our results support the usefulness of SR-Pyr in an individualized therapeutic regimen to improve quality of life regardless of the patient's age in myasthenia gravis. This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine. Despite a lack of data from well controlled clinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine is the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG.  Novel AChE inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and preliminary results appear to be promising. Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no randomised controlled trial has been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in the placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify.  Current guidelines and recommendations for MG treatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and expert consensus. Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying treatments. Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary, symptomatic treatment for all forms of myasthenia gravis. 	[['neostigmine'], ['pyridostigmine']]
54d4e03a3706e89528000001	Which are the classes of anti-arrhythmic drugs according to Vaughan-Williams classification?	Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.  Other agents which do not fall neatly into the Vaughan Williams classification include digoxin and perhexiline. Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium. Thus, the Vaughan Williams classification also coincides with the main myocardial targets of the antiarrhythmics, i.e., myocardial sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-channels or beta-adrenergic receptors.  The sodium-channel blockade induced by class-I substances is enhanced with increasing heart rates. Thus, class-I antiarrhythmics can be subclassified as substances showing a more exponential, an approximately linear, or rather saturated block-frequency relation. Class-III antiarrhythmics (potassium-channel blockade) can be further differentiated according to the component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) which is inhibited by a drug.  Class-III substances inhibiting the slowly activating IKs component are currently under investigation and are expected to show a direct rate dependence. Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium.  Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium The classification of antiarrhythmic agents according to Vaughan Williams is based on electrophysiological findings in isolated heart muscle and defines four classes of drug actions. Antiarrhythmic agents are traditionally classified according to Vaughan Williams into four classes of action. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the b-adrenoceptor blockers. Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone.  Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.  These are classified according to their electrophysiological effects observed in isolated cardiac tissues in vitro (Vaughan Williams, 1989). Fast sodium channel blockers (class I) which reduce the upstroke velocity of the action potential are usually subclassified into three groups, class I A-C, according to their effect on the action potential duration. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (class II) exert their effects by antagonizing the electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines. Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg amiodarone) prolong the action potential and slow calcium channel blockers (class IV) suppress the calcium inward current and calcium-dependent action potentials.

53061af558348c0f52000002	Which are the major characteristics of cellular senescence?	Cellular senescence is recognized as a critical cellular response to prolonged rounds of replication and environmental stresses. Its defining characteristics are arrested cell-cycle progression and the development of aberrant gene expression with proinflammatory behavior. telomeres are the central timing mechanism for cellular aging Recent research has shown that inserting a gene for the protein component of telomerase into senescent human cells reextends their telomeres to lengths typical of young cells, and the cells then display all the other identifiable characteristics of young, healthy cells. Our data demonstrate that Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an elevation in the ratio of Sod1 activity to Gpx1 activity produce higher levels of H2O2 and exhibit well characterised markers of cellular senescence viz. slower proliferation and altered morphology.

5718bbb37de986d80d00000b	Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?	Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) Mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), the enzyme that synthesises mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), have been associated with a mitochondrial disease-autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia-and multiple deletions of mtDNA. About 150 mutations in the human POLG have been identified in patients with mitochondrial diseases such as Alpers syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia-neuropathy syndromes. Nineteen exhibited a cluster of three or more predefined clinical manifestations suggestive of POLG-related disease: progressive external ophthalmoplegia, seizures and/or an abnormal electroencephalogram, neuropathy, ataxia, liver function abnormalities, migraine or dysphagia/dysarthria.

54f9d3eedd3fc62544000004	Which proteins participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex?	Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a Ca(2+) storage protein that interacts with triadin (TRN), the ryanodine receptor (RyR), and junctin (JUN) to form a macromolecular tetrameric Ca(2+) signaling complex in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The decrease of CASQ2 is associated with a reduction in the levels of Triadin (TrD) and Junctin (JnC), two proteins that form, with CASQ2 and RyR2, a macromolecular complex devoted to control of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Triadin and junctin are integral sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form a macromolecular complex with the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) but their roles in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.  In cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). By binding directly the RyR and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins. Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin.  Junctin is a transmembrane protein of the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin 1. This quaternary protein complex is thought to facilitate SR Ca2+ release. In mammalian striated muscles, ryanodine receptor (RyR), triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin form a quaternary complex in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Such intermolecular interactions contribute not only to the passive buffering of sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, but also to the active Ca2+ release process during excitation-contraction coupling.  Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.  Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin. Several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for Ca2+ release. These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor.  Taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca2+ release. Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin. Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane. Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle. Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.

515deafd298dcd4e51000025	List the endoscopic diagnoses that have been reported in children with autism	Autism and esophageal achalasia in childhood: a possible correlation? In the last case, a 15-year-old male underwent barium swallow and endoscopy that confirmed achalasia. Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation. The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children. A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation. Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls. METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69.4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24. The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration. Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea. Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients. The observed increase in pancreatico-biliary secretion after secretin infusion suggests an upregulation of secretin receptors in the pancreas and liver. three children with autistic spectrum disorders who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and intravenous administration of secretin to stimulate pancreaticobiliary secretion. All three had an increased pancreaticobiliary secretory response when compared with nonautistic patients (	[['Reflux esophagitis'], ['Achalasia'], ['chronic gastritis'], ['chronic duodenitis'], ['inflammation of the small bowel and colorectum'], ['Ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH)']]
52bf202003868f1b06000018	What are the main indications of lacosamide?	The current article presents a concise review of network theory and its application to the characterization of AED use in children with refractory epilepsy. Furthermore, first generation AEDs were often discontinued, while lacosamide and topiramate were most likely to be initiated.  Overall, there is compelling evidence that salivary TDM can be usefully applied so as to optimize the treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine, clobazam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, topiramate, and zonisamide. The first examples are carbamazepine, gabapentin, and lacosamide as drugs well established in epilepsy market as well as drug candidates such as valnoctamide, and other valproic acid derivatives, novel biphenyl pyrazole derivatives, etc. Two additional AEDs, lacosamide and eslicarbazepine acetate, have been licensed recently for a more traditional indication, refractory partial-onset seizures.  A discussion is made of recent findings that the atypical antidepressant tianeptine increases CRMP2 expression, whereas other, neuroactive small molecules including the epilepsy drug lacosamide and the natural brain metabolite lanthionine ketimine appear to bind CRMP2 directly with concomitant affects on neural structure. Lacosamide (LCM) is a newer antiepileptic drug with a dual mode of action.  It has shown potent and broad neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo animal models making it a potential candidate for long term treatment of epilepsy. In addition to this, it has demonstrated analgesic activity in various animal models. Apart from this, LCM has demonstrated potent effects in animal models for a variety of CNS disorders like schizophrenia and stress induced anxiety.  Clinical trials have also suggested that LCM is a safe, effective, and well tolerated adjunctive treatment for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with highly refractory, partial seizures. Lacosamide (LCM), (SPM 927, (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide, previously referred to as harkoseride or ADD 234037) is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized as anticonvulsive drug candidates. LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different rodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal models that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as chronic inflammatory pain. Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of action underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity. Currently, LCM is in a late stage of clinical development as an adjunctive treatment for patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and it is being assessed as monotherapy in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.  Lacosamide was effective against sound-induced seizures in the genetically susceptible Frings mouse, against maximal electroshock test (MES)-induced seizures in rats and mice, in the rat hippocampal kindling model of partial seizures, and in the 6Hz model of psychomotor seizures in mice. Lacosamide was inactive against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous administration of the chemoconvulsants pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, but it did inhibit NMDA-induced seizures in mice and showed full efficacy in the homocysteine model of epilepsy. These results suggest that lacosamide may have the potential to be clinically useful for at least the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic and partial-onset epilepsies, and support ongoing clinical trials in these indications.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome, one of the common causes of acute renal failure in children, is characterized by the triad of microangiopathy, haemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. The diarrhoea-associated Hemolytic uremic syndrome is usually termed as a typical Hemolytic uremic syndrome.	[['anaemia'], ['thrombocytopenia'], ['renal failure']]
56a92be0a17756b72f000009	Which factors activate zygotic gene expression during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish?	Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 activate zygotic gene expression during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish.

56c3327c50c68dd41600000c	Which DNA sequences are more prone for the formation of R-loops?	R-loops, transcriptionally-induced RNA:DNA hybrids, occurring at repeat tracts (CTG)n, (CAG)n, (CGG)n, (CCG)n and (GAA)n, are associated with diseases including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, fragile X and Friedreich's ataxia Double-R-loop formation and processing to instability was extended to the expanded C9orf72 (GGGGCC)·(GGCCCC) repeats, known to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, providing the first suggestion through which these repeats may become unstable.  Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes Furthermore, we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements R-loops associated with triplet repeat expansions Periodic DNA patrolling underlies diverse functions of Pif1 on R-loops and G-rich DNA Ginno et al. (2012) describe unusual sequence features at promoter CpG islands that can lead to formation of persistent RNA-DNA hybrids (R loops), which are proposed to prevent genomic DNA methylation R loops stimulate genetic instability of CTG.CAG repeats  We demonstrate, using biochemical and genetic approaches, that the formation of stable RNA.DNA hybrids enhances the instability of CTG.CAG repeat tracts.  The R-loop, previously characterized in vitro at the leading strand replication origin (OH), is isolated as a native RNA-DNA hybrid copurifying with mtDNA All of these R-loops arise upon generation of a G-rich RNA strand by an RNA polymerase upon transcription of a C-rich DNA template strand. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other R-loops We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5&apos;UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand which is rich in AT and not prone to form R-loops, Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other R-loops.

5314a7a4dae131f847000003	which mutations of troponin C gene have been found to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	The Ca(2+) binding properties of the FHC-associated cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation L29Q were examined in isolated cTnC, troponin complexes, reconstituted thin filament preparations, and skinned cardiomyocytes.  Effects of calcium binding and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy A8V mutation on the dynamic equilibrium between closed and open conformations of the regulatory N-domain of isolated cardiac troponin C We also used PRE data to assess the structural effects of a familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy point mutation located within the N-domain of cTnC (A8V).  A mutation in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C, TNNC1-A31S, predisposes to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular fibrillation. Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death. In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A. We describe a novel type of mutation (c.363dupG) in Troponin C, a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We report the first frameshift mutation (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male, and have demonstrated that the mutation segregates with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within the family. One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition). In this study, we investigated the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutations A8V, E134D, and D145E in cardiac troponin C on the properties of the C-domain sites. Recently four new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E) were reported, and their effects on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development were evaluated Comprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutation analysis of TNNC1 performed on 1025 unrelated HCM patients enrolled over the last 10 years revealed novel missense mutations in TNNC1: A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E. The cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation, L29Q, has been found in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results demonstrate that the L29Q mutation enhances the Ca(2+)-binding characteristics of cTnC and that when incorporated into cardiac myocytes, this mutant alters myocyte contractility. Cardiac troponin C-L29Q, related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hinders the transduction of the protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation signal from cardiac troponin I to C. This mutation leads to a leucine-glutamine exchange at position 29 in the nonfunctional calcium-binding site of cTnC.

56c6dd275795f9a73e000008	Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin?	H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. This result indicates that H3K36me3 is associated with both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin. Classical histone modifications associated with heterochromatin, including H3K9me2, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2, were distributed throughout both A and B chromosomes. In this review, available data will be evaluated concerning (1) the phylogenetic distribution of H3K9me as heterochromatin-specific histone modification and its evolutionary stability in relation to other epigenetic marks, (2) known families of H3K9 methyltransferases, (3) their responsibility for the formation of constitutive heterochromatin and (4) the evolution of Su(var)3-9-like and SUVH-like H3K9 methyltransferases  While these regions were furthermore largely devoid of the constitutive heterochromatin marker H3K9-me3, we observed rapid and widespread deposition of H3K27-me3 across latent KSHV genomes, a bivalent modification which is able to repress transcription in spite of the simultaneous presence of activating marks. Histone modifications in Arabidopsis- high methylation of H3 lysine 9 is dispensable for constitutive heterochromatin The recent discovery of the first histone Lys methyltransferase has allowed the identification of a molecular mechanism in which the specific methylation of histone H3 at Lys9 generates a binding site for heterochromatin-associated proteins. At the SUMO-1 labelled areas, the presence of HP1alpha protein, as well as of trimethylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 histone modifications, supports a role for SUMO-1 in constitutive heterochromatin organization. Surprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3). Constitutive heterochromatin during mouse oogenesis: the pattern of histone H3 modifications and localization of HP1alpha and HP1beta proteins. In fission yeast, heterochromatin formation requires RNAi and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC, composed of Clr4, Raf1, Raf2, Cul4, and Rik1.  Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-Lys9) by site-specific histone methyltransferases (Suv39h HMTases) marks constitutive heterochromatin.  H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage. In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the histone mark H3K27me3.

56c1f005ef6e39474100003a	Which interleukins are inhibited by Dupilumab?	The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication "atopic dermatitis" were published in 2014. These motivated (1) to extend the studies to dupilumab and (2) to clinically test antagonization of other target molecules of TH2 polarized, atopic inflammation, e.g., IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, TSLP, and CRTH2. A Among the recently developed antiasthma biologic drugs, the monoclonal antibody dupilumab is very promising because of its ability to inhibit the biological effects of both IL-4 and IL-13. Indeed, dupilumab prevents IL-4/13 interactions with the α-subunit of the IL-4 receptor complex.  BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.   In early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting IL-4 receptor α, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of IL-4/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized. Examples include the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with severe refractory atopic asthma characterized by raised serum total IgE, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab in patients with recurrent eosinophilic exacerbations characterized by blood and sputum eosinophilia despite high doses of corticosteroids, and lebrikizumab, pitrakinra, dupilumab, and tralokinumab that target the IL-4/IL-13 signalling pathways in patients with eosinophilic asthma or raised serum periostin. BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe asthma remains poorly treated. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. With respect to immune dysregulation, dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit was recently shown to be effective in treating adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.

571529efcb4ef8864c000001	Which antibiotics target peptidoglycan biosynthesis?	Treatment with antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibits chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium To detect cells just after division, we used colchicine, which inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division We investigated the effects of antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis on chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex Recent advances in pneumococcal peptidoglycan biosynthesis suggest new vaccine and antimicrobial targets. Of late, the peptidoglycan (PG) layer, the most important component of the bacterial cell wall has been the subject of drug targeting because, first, it is essential for the survivability of eubacteria and secondly, it is absent in humans. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. A dose-response experiment with an E. coli strain susceptible to ampicillin demonstrated a weak effect before the MIC dose.  In an initial approach, the procedure accurately discriminates susceptible, intermediate and resistant strains of Escherichia coli to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Here, we compare the staining patterns observed in Bacillus subtilis using fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. Ramoplanin probes may be better imaging agents than vancomycin probes because they yield clear staining patterns at concentrations well below their minimum inhibitory concentrations. Structures of the muraymycins, novel peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibitors. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis.  Rethinking ramoplanin: the role of substrate binding in inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Vancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. The lantibiotic mersacidin has been previously reported to interfere with bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant bacteria by a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic. LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism? Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. n contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. Inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by ramoplanin. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria. Bacitracin and other antibiotics that inhibit late stages in peptidoglycan biosynthesis induce vancomycin resistance in a high-level, inducibly vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium. This effect does not involve a change in the permeability of the cell wall by this drug and is consistent with the identification of D-alanine racemase as a target of D-cycloserine.  CONCLUSIONS: Several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation.  The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment.  Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.  Fosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc and alanine-alanine. In contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface. The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Modulation of transport processes, cofactor biosynthesis, energy metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis was also observed. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.

53358cd2d6d3ac6a3400004e	List two common features of Tay syndrome.	TTD is part of a more broadly defined group of diseases identified as IBIDS (ichthyosis, brittle hair, impaired intelligence, decreased fertility and short stature). Photosensitive cases are also identified as PIBIDS (photosensitivity with IBIDS). Cases without manifest ichthyosis are also identified as PBIDS. These syndromes defy rigorous definition because of clinical variation between patients. The original two cases were described by Tay in oriental siblings, whose parents were first cousins; thus the disease is also known as Tay syndrome.  Tay syndrome or IBIDS is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis and abnormal brittle hair (trichothiodystrophy). Other features include photosensitivity, abnormal nails and multiple developmental defects affecting organs mainly derived from neuroectoderm.  We report a case of trichothiodystrophy initially classified as Tay syndrome that based on clinical features, complementary exams as well as on the disease evolution was labelled as PIBIDS syndrome. Tay-syndrome is a rare monogen-inherited ektodermal dysplastic syndrome with ichtyosis, fragility of the hair and physical and mental retardation. The congenital ichtyosis is ubiquitous. Only the skin on the flexion side of the extremity joints are not involved (orthocerathosis combined with paraceratotic strings). In Tay syndrome, the trichothiodystrophy is accompanied by congenital ichthyosis, short stature, delayed physical and mental development and pyramidal tract signs with increase in muscular tone and brisk tendon reflexes.  We present a case of Tay syndrome in which a cranial MRI revealed an almost total lack of myelin within the cerebral hemispheres and a patchy hypomyelination of the cerebellum. In accordance, a strongly prolonged visual evoked response pointed to a dysfunction of the white matter in Tay syndrome. For example, the brittle hair due to sulphur deficiency (trichothiodystrophy) is nowadays regarded as genetically heterogeneous; three different syndromes can be distinguished: BIDS syndrome, Tay syndrome, and PIBIDS syndrome.  The Tay syndrome (congenital ichthyosis with trichothiodystrophy). The Tay syndrome is a distinct type of congenital ichthyosis characterized by a peculiar anomaly of hair growth which has been termed trichothiodystrophy.  Other features of this syndrome are low birth weight, short stature, mental retardation, delayed neuromuscular development and other CNS anomalies, dysplasia of nails, hypoplasia of subcutaneous fatty tissue, prematurely aged facial appearance, hypogonadism, cataracts, osteosclerosis, dysphonia, and increased susceptibility to infections.

52b2d405f828ad283c000009	Which cell types are known to be driving Rheumatoid Arthritis?	Integration of GWAS results with cell-type specific gene expression or epigenetic marks have highlighted regulatory T cells and CD4 memory T cells as critical cell types in RA A subset of synovial DCs is important in the response to cigarette smoke  we demonstrate that autoimmune patient (systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis) serum activates both pDC and B cells, but IRAK1/4 kinase inhibition affects only the pDC response, underscoring the differential IRAK1/4 functional requirements in human immune cell In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), activated synovial fibroblasts (SFs) have the ability to invade joint cartilage, actively contributing to joint destruction in RA Recently, RASFs have been shown to be able to migrate to non-affected areas and joints through the blood stream and to invade distant cartilage MSC interaction with B cells provides stimuli for B-cell survival and therefore may contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are resident mesenchymal cells of synovial joints that have been recognized to play an increasingly important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) This study investigates the production of CCL18 in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), the predominant cell type recruited into synovial fluid (SF) In this regard, macrophages, T cells and their respective cytokines play a pivotal role in RA it has been understood that resident, fibroblast-like cells contribute significantly to the perpetuation of disease, and that they may even play a role in its initiation RASFs are no longer considered passive bystanders but active players in the complex intercellular network of RA These rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) constitute a quite unique cell type that distinguishes RA from other inflammatory conditions of the joints The molecular feature that defines the myofibroblast-like phenotype was reflected as an increased proportion of myofibroblast-like cells in the heterogeneous FLS population ur findings support the notion that heterogeneity between synovial tissues is reflected in FLS as a stable trait, and provide evidence of a possible link between the behavior of FLS and the inflammation status of RA synovium This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the synovial monocyte/macrophage population In RA patients, both etanercept and infliximab are able to induce cell type-specific apoptosis in the monocyte/macrophage population Furthermore, fluorescent double-staining showed that the HOXD9 protein was expressed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) AHR gene expression was demonstrated in rheumatoid synovial tissues and nodules with significantly greater expression in synovia.

518cb4b5310faafe08000006	Which drugs are utilized to treat amiodarone-induced thyroitoxicosis?	good response to anti-thyroid drugs and steroid therapy The disease course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is usually benign and remits with timely administration of anti-thyroid medications, with or without corticosteroids. RIT may be a safe and useful method of AIT therapy in patients with low RAIU, in whom other treatment methods are contraindicated. Treatment consists in the use of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs and steroids in an isolated form or in combination. the addition of lithium carbonate to the two other drugs resulted in a successful and safety therapy in controlling amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. lithium is a useful and safe medication for treatment of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis caused by amiodarone. Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping amiodarone treatment. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT).	[['Antithyroid drugs'], ['Corticosteroids'], ['Lithium'], ['Radioiodine']]

BCL11B is up-regulated by EWS/FLI and contributes to the transformed phenotype in Ewing sarcoma EWS/FLI dysregulates gene expression during tumorigenesis by abnormally activating or repressing genes. The expression levels of thousands of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, however, it is unknown which of these genes contribute to the transformed phenotype. Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant transcription factor to regulate genes that mediate the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma. One of these regulated genes, NR0B1, encodes a corepressor protein, and likely plays a transcriptional role in tumorigenesis GSTM4 is a microsatellite-containing EWS/FLI target involved in Ewing's sarcoma oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance We recently showed that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4 promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter The gene that was most reproducibly up-regulated by EWS/FLI was NR0B1 We validated NR0B1 as an EWS/FLI-dysregulated gene and confirmed its expression in primary human tumor samples Expression profiling of EWS/FLI identifies NKX2.2 as a critical target gene in Ewing's sarcoma Functional analysis revealed that NKX2.2 is an EWS/FLI-regulated gene that is necessary for oncogenic transformation in this tumor Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis We recently showed that EWS/FLI interacts with GGAA-microsatellites to regulate some of its target genes, including NR0B1, an EWS/FLI-regulated gene that is required for the oncogenic phenotype of Ewings sarcoma. BCL11B is up-regulated by EWS/FLI and contributes to the transformed phenotype in Ewing sarcoma. The gene that was most reproducibly up-regulated by EWS/FLI was NR0B1.

533c3af6c45e13371400000d	Which pathological conditions are caused by mutations in the CYLD gene?	We detected a frameshift mutation in the CYLD gene, designated 2253delG, underlying the disorder and were able to show that a single mutation can result in distinct clinical and histologic expression in familial cylindromatosis. Previously, a candidate MTF locus has been mapped to 9p21 while disease gene for familial cylindromatosis, the CYLD gene located on 16q21-13 has been identified Here, we show that mutations in the CYLD gene are also the genetic basis for three different Chinese families with MFT familial trichoepithelioma (MFT) and familial cylindromatosis are two clinically distinct cancer syndromes. MFT patients developed mostly trichoepithelioma in the face while cylindromatosis patients developed cylindromas predominantly (approximately 90%) on the head and neck phenotype of familial cylindromatosis associated with an R758X nonsense mutation in the CYLD tumour suppressor gene We describe a family with cylindromatosis, in which affected individuals have an inherited R758X nonsense mutation of CYLD YLD mutations underlie Brooke-Spiegler, familial cylindromatosis, and multiple familial trichoepithelioma syndromes We describe a single family with affected members exhibiting either the FC or the MFT phenotypes associated with a mutation in the CYLD gene.  ndividuals with germline mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene CYLD are at high risk of developing disfiguring cutaneous appendageal tumours, the defining tumour being the highly organised cylindroma YLD is a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in the skin appendage tumors cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas.  In addition, we have characterized Maspin downregulation in cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas carrying functional inactivating mutations of CYLD, also providing an evidence of the correlation between impaired CYLD function and Maspin decreased expression in vivo in human tumors Germ‑line mutation in cylindromatosis (CYLD), a tumor suppressor gene, causes familial cylindromatosis and Brook‑Spiegler syndrome atients carrying heterozygous germline truncating mutations in the CYLD gene develop multiple primary hair follicle-related tumours. A highly patterned tumour, termed cylindroma, and a highly disorganized tumour, termed spiradenoma, may both develop in the same patient. ultiple trichoepitheliomas associated with a novel heterozygous mutation in the CYLD gene as an adjunct to the histopathological diagnosis ultiple trichoepitheliomas (TEs), especially in the familial setting, have been associated with germline heterozygous mutations in the CYLD gene We describe a 35-year-old woman with multiple facial TEs, in whom the molecular genetic analysis revealed a novel heterozygous c.1843delT mutation in the CYLD gene This frameshift mutation was also present in a heterozygous state in the TE tumor cells. The demonstration of a novel CYLD mutation was used as an adjunct to the histopathological diagnosis in this case novel germline mutation in the CYLD gene in a Slovak patient with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome This new germline mutation in the CYLD gene of a Slovak patient with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome extends the catalogue of known CYLD germline mutations in this condition Molecular biologic study of the CYLD gene performed from the peripheral blood identified a novel splice site c.2041+1 G>T mutation Patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome have various mutations in the CYLD gene, a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 16q Mutation and loss of heterozygosity of the CYLD gene causes development of cylindromatosis, a benign tumour originating from the skin Our study shows that CYLD expression is dramatically downregulated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common cancer in humans Although some early studies suggested a role for the PTCH gene on chromosome 9q22.3 in the etiopathogenesis of MFT, recent studies of occasional patients with the MFT clinical phenotype identified mutations in the CYLD gene on chromosome 16q12-q13, a gene responsible for BSS Since loss of CYLD expression can be observed in different types of human cancer, it is now well established that CYLD acts as a tumor suppressor gene mutations in CYLD can be identified in patients affected with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, (Familial) Cylindromatosis or multiple familial trichoepithelioma we demonstrate that the expression in tumorigenic epidermal cells of a catalytically inactive form of CYLD (CYLD(C/S)) that mimics the identified mutations of cyld in human tumors and competes with the endogenous CYLD results in enhanced cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosi In contrast with previous studies showing the development of benign tumors by mutations in the CYLD gene, here we provide evidence that the occurrence of mutations in the CYLD gene in tumorigenic epidermal cells (carrying previous mutations) increases the aggressiveness of carcinomas, mainly through enhancement of the expression of angiogenic factors, having therefore a key role in epidermal cancer malignancy By interphase cytogenetics, a (sub)clonal biallelic CYLD deletion was observed by interphase cytogenetics in 1 of 29 primary cHL, whereas signal patterns indicating decreased CYLD

The 4H syndrome (hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) is a newly recognized leukodystrophy.  The five overlapping clinical phenotypes (described as distinct entities before their molecular basis was known) include: Hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome); Ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); Tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); Leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO); and Hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC).

511a4d391159fa8212000003	Which are the plant DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase families?	The topologies of the trees were overall congruent: four monophyletic groups corresponding to the four plant C5-MTase families were clearly distinguished. In addition, sequence analyses of the plant C5-MTase target recognition domain sequences were performed and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed showing that there is good conservation among but not within the plant C5-MTase families. To determine the inheritance of DNA methyltransferase genes and their expression patterns we examined three major DNA methyltransferase families (MET1, CMT3 and DRM) from tobacco and the progenitor species. The comparative investigation of transcription levels of different genes of cytosine DNA methyltransferase family MET (MET1, MET2a, MET2b, MET3) and their methylation patterns shows that there may exist some mechanisms defending the most actively transcribed gene MET1 of this family from methylation mediated silencing. In contrast to DRM2 gene we could not find any adenine methylated GATC sites in the MET1 gene. Using the 1kb 3' terminal DNA fragment of the mouse methyltransferase cDNA as a probe and low stringent hybridisation conditions, a new potential methyltransferase (MTase) gene family was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA library. The Dnmt3 family of de novo DNA methyltransferases has recently been characterized in animals. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. These results provide the first direct demonstration that DNA-METases of a higher eukaryote are encoded by a gene family. Here we show that Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase2 (AtDNMT2) is localized in nucleus and associates with histone deacetylation. To explore possible relationships between DNA methylation level and accumulation of DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase (DNMT) transcripts, the full-length coding sequences corresponding to three different DNMT families in oil palm, namely the MET, CMT, and DRM classes, have been isolated and characterized. In Arabidopsis a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling factor-related protein DDM1 and a cytosine methyltransferase MET1 are required for maintenance of genomic cytosine methylation. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. In the present study, the isolation and characterization of two distinct cDNAs that code for carrot DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNA-METase) are reported. The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytosine-5 methyltransferases and shows 50% homology to the murine enzyme in the methyltransferase domain. As deduced form the DNA sequence this protein contains all conserved sequence motifs specific for the 5m cytosine MTases.	[['MET'], ['CMT'], ['DRM']]
517137c18ed59a060a000001	In which proteins is the chromodomain present?	Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 affects the repair of X-ray and UV-induced DNA damage. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD) belong to a group of highly conserved chromatin remodeling proteins that are implicated in regulation of transcription. In an effort to understand the physiological role of one of the CHD members in a mammalian model system, we developed a mutant mouse model for the Chd2 gene. Crystal structure of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) DNA-binding domain in complex with DNA. Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. In suvh4 suvh5 suvh6 and cmt3 mutants, H3K9me2 associated with lacO repeats is diminished, but homologous pairing persists. Mutations in CHD7, the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, are present in 60-80% of individuals with the CHARGE syndrome. Chromodomain is present in the integrase structures of blastopia and 412 subgroup LTR-retrotransposons and may facilitate the process of non-specific integration. The CHARGE syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome that usually results from deletion or heterozygous loss of function mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene at 8q12.1. A causative mutation within the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 gene, which plays an important role in the embryonic development, is present in 2/3 of affected patients. CHD1 is a subfamily member of the CHD family, which possesses a chromodomain, a helicase domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The chromatin organizer modifier domain (chromodomain) is present in proteins that contribute to chromatin organization and mediates their binding to methylated histone H3. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory. Here we identify the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) as a novel coregulator of androgen-responsive transcription. Mutations in CHD7, a chromodomain gene, are present in a majority of individuals with CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly disorder characterized by ocular Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia and Ear anomalies. Two new chromodomain-containing proteins that associate with heterochromatin in Sciara coprophila chromosomes. Both proteins, ScoHET1 of 37 kDa and ScoHET2 of 44 kDa, display two chromodomain motifs that contain the conserved residues essential for the recognition of methylated histone H3 at lysine 9. In this study, we present a detailed histomorphologic characterization of mice containing a mutation in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (Chd2). Specificity of the chromodomain Y chromosome family of chromodomains for lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs. Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. We assessed mRNA transcript abundance of seven genes that code for proteins with established roles in epigenetically-mediated gene silencing [transcriptional co-repressor SIN3A, DNA (cytosine-5-) methyltransferase 1, methyl CpG binding protein 2, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, histone binding protein rbbp4, histone deacetylase 1 and nuclear receptor co-repressor 2] using qRT-PCR. CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes. The cysteine-rich CXXC domains of MBD1 bound to Ring1b and the chromodomain of hPc2. Methylation of lysine 9 within histone H3 and the subsequent binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are thought to initiate heterochromatin formation in vivo and to propagate a heterochromatic state lasting through several cell divisions. Here, we show that the SNF2-like chromodomain helicase protein CHD8 interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF. C The chromodomain (CD) of the Drosophila Polycomb protein exhibits preferential binding affinity for histone H3 when trimethylated at lysine 27. Despite a high degree of conservation, the Cbx chromodomains display significant differences in binding preferences. Three-dimensional solution structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43. Recently, three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs) have been identified in cpSRP43. The C-terminal helical segment typically found in the nuclear chromodomains is absent in CD1. Critical comparison of the structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43 with those found in nuclear chromodomain proteins revealed that the diverse protein-protein interactions mediated by the CDs appear to stem from the differences that exist in the surface charge potentials of each CD. Characterization and functional analysis of CReMM, a novel chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein. The present study describes a newly identified protein named CReMM (chromatin-related mesenchymal modulator). The protein was studied by bioinformatic means and classified as a member of the third subfamily of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD). In silico translation defined CReMM as a multiple domains protein including two chromodomains, SNF2/ATPase, helicase C domain and an A/T-DNA-binding domain (DBD). Identification and analysis of chromodomain-containing proteins encoded in the mouse transcriptome. The chromodomain is 40-50 amino acids in length and is conserved in a wide range of chromatic and regulatory proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. Chromodomain-containing proteins can be classified into families based on their broader characteristics, in particular the presence of other types of domains, and which correlate with different subclasses of the chromodomains themselves. Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions. In addition to the canonical MYST HAT catalytic domain, both TgMYST-A and -B possess an atypical C2HC zinc finger and a chromodomain. Clr7 and Clr8 are required for localization of the Swi6 chromodomain protein and for histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, thereby influencing not only mating-type switching but also transcriptional silencing in all previously characterized heterochromatic regions, chromosome segregation, and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region. MRG15, a novel chromodomain protein, is present in two distinct multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional activation. MRG15 is a novel chromodomain protein that is a member of a family of genes related to MORF4. MORF4 (mortality factor on chromosome 4) induces senescence in a subset of human tumor cell lines. Analysis of deletion mutants of MRG15 indicated that the leucine zipper at the C-terminal region of MRG15 was important for the protein associations in MAF1 and that the N-terminal chromodomain was required for the assembly of the MAF2 protein complex. Consistent with these data was the fact that a histone acetyltransferase activity associated with MRG15 was lost when the chromodomain was deleted and that both mutant MRG15 proteins failed to activate the B-myb promoter. The various mechanisms by which MRG15 could activate gene transcription are discussed. The chromodomain (CD) is a highly conserved motif present in a variety of animal and plant proteins, and its probable role is to assemble a variety of macromolecular complexes in chromatin. Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tail. The chromodomain of the HP1 family of proteins recognizes histone tails with specifically methylated lysines. Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing. The histone tail inserts as a beta strand, completing the beta-sandwich architecture of the chromodomain. The methylammonium group is caged by three aromatic side chains, whereas adjacent residues form discerning contacts with one face of the chromodomain. The MORF4-Related Gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) is a member of a novel family of genes originally identified in studies to reveal cell senescence-inducing factors. MRG15 contains several predicted protein motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, a leucine zipper, and a chromodomain. Four alleles of dMi-2 mutants were further characterized in molecular nature; dMi-2(BL1) was found to have a mutation in the ATP-binding motif of the ATPase domain, dMi-2(BL7) in the core histidine of the first plant homeodomain zinc finger and dMi-2(BL12) in a conserved serine in the chromodomain. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus. CHD1 interacts with SSRP1 and depends on both its chromodomain and its ATPase/helicase-like domain for proper association with chromatin. Interaction between an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane and human chromodomain proteins homologous to Drosophila HP1. A mammalian DNA-binding protein that contains a chromodomain and an SNF2/SWI2-like helicase domain. A Southern blot analysis indicated that this protein, which we have named CHD-1, for chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein, is present in most, if not all, mammalian species. Here we show that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) forms a complex with Gata3 in Th2 cells that both activates Th2 cytokine transcription and represses the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the defining subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is a nucleosome-remodeling protein of the SNF2/ISWI2 family, members of which contain two chromo domains and an ATP-dependent helicase module. Among those proteins with >40% regulation were Macrophage Capping protein (CAPG) and Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins which were significantly upregulated by pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H overexpression. This heterochromatin coordinates expression levels by associating with a chromodomain protein Chp1 and an antisilencing factor Epe1. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT. Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a tumor suppressor mapping to 1p36, a genomic region that is frequently deleted in human cancer. Here, we identify ENHANCED PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (EPP1), previously known as PICKLE (PKL), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor of the chromodomain/helicase/DNA binding family, as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromodomain on Y-like (CDYL) is a chromodomain protein that has sequence homology to members of the enoyl CoA hydratase family. Our previous structural work demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66α) proteins recruits the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2β) to the NuRD complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M. N., Scarsdale, J. N., Amaya, M. L., Webb, H. D., Desai, M. A., Walavalkar, N. M., Wang, S. Z., Zu Zhu, S., Ginder, G. D., and Williams, D. C., Jr. (2011) p66α-MBD2 coiled-coil interaction and recruitment of Mi-2 are critical for globin gene silencing by the MBD2-NuRD complex. Sequence analysis showed that NlElp3 contains GNAT-type HAT domain and Radical SAM domain, and NlMof contains chromodomain and MOZ-SAS acetyltransferase domain. We examined requirements for individual domains of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), a core catalytic component of NuRD complexes, as well as the NuRD subunit methyl-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and methylated DNA, for NuRD function in the context of tissue-specific transcription. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase/adenosine triphosphatase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) is an SNF2-like transcription factor involved in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twelve rare copy number variants segregate with talipes equinovarus in multiplex pedigrees, and contain the developmentally expressed transcription factors and transcriptional regulators PITX1, TBX4, HOXC13, UTX, CHD (chromodomain protein)1, and RIPPLY2. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) plays a role in normal neural development and in tumorigenesis of various human cancers. The chromodomain, helicase, DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a chromatin remodeling enzyme which is implicated in tumor suppression. The methyl-mark determines a highly flexible and very dynamic interaction of the chromodomain of hHP1β with the H3-tail. To test this hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive molecular dynamics study in which we analyzed a crystallographically defined complex that involves the HP1 chromodomain and an H3 tail peptide. Whereas the molecular target of the MRG15 chromodomain (CD) has been suggested to be H3K36me(2/3), the precise molecular target of the Pf1 plant homeodomain 1 (PHD1) has remained elusive. Chp1, a chromodomain (CD) protein, forms the Ago1-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and recruits siRNA-bound RITS to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) via its CD. In addition, cells expressing S473A also displayed defective mobilization of the HP1-β chromodomain protein. CHD7 is a chromodomain-containing, ATP dependent helicase protein that is highly expressed in the developing ear and is required for semicircular canal development in both humans and mice. Moreover, the LTR retrotransposon fraction in BAC clones harboring genes is disproportionately composed of chromodomain-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons ('chromoviruses'), and the majority of the intact chromoviruses contain tandem chromodomain duplications. Stimulated by positively charged residues in the hinge region, RNA competes with methylated histone H3K9 for binding to the chromodomain of HP1(Swi6). CHD7 is one of the nine members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. Therefore, p53, ZNF237, and Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 3 inhibit the function ER Ca²⁺ leak channels to regulate both ER and cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels and may potentially control Ca²⁺-signaling function of PS1. We show that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding domain 2 (Chd2), a SNF2 chromatin remodelling enzyme family member, interacts with MyoD and myogenic gene regulatory sequences to specifically mark these loci via deposition of the histone variant H3.3 prior to cell differentiation. Analysis of the Neurospora crassa chromodomain protein CDP-2, a component of a newly characterized HP1-containing complex, reveals a second gene-silencing mechanism and provides insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin domains that possess shared components. We state that the non-tumorogenic potential of bitumen transformant in nude/SCID mice can be attributed to the downregulation of galectin-1, chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1-like gene, and membrane-associated guanylate kinase 2 protein. Mutagenesis of Tf1 integrase revealed that the complete Tf1 integrase protein (excluding its chromodomain) is required for stimulating the Tf1 RT primer removal activity. About 80% of patients with a clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Owing to different polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing events, the human CBX2 locus produces two transcripts: a 5-exon transcript that encodes the 532-amino acid CBX2-1 isoform that contains the conserved chromodomain and Pc box and a 4-exon transcript encoding a shorter isoform, CBX2-2, lacking the Pc box but still possessing a chromodomain. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) is the core catalytic subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin remodeling complex. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD) belong to a group of highly conserved chromatin remodeling proteins that are implicated in regulation of transcription. Here, we report that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a novel BRIT1 binding partner that regulates the HR repair process. Here, we report that the chromodomain-containing protein MRG-1 is an important factor for genomic integrity in meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The chromodomain protein, Chromator, can be divided into two main domains, a NH(2)-terminal domain (NTD) containing the chromodomain (ChD) and a COOH-terminal domain (CTD) containing a nuclear localization signal. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a potent tumor suppressor that serves as a master regulator of a tumor-suppressive network. By high-resolution tiling array CGH, the smallest common deletion targeted just one gene, the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1). Here we report direct evidence for presynaptic pairing activity intrinsic to non-PC regions, which is facilitated by a conserved chromodomain protein, MRG-1. The chromodomain of MPP8 recognizes the dimethylated Dnmt3aK44me2. Members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins are thought to regulate gene expression. It has been shown that the methylation mark of vertebrate histone H1 is specifically recognized by the chromodomain of HP1. To this end, we have performed mutation studies on the Drosophila HP1α chromodomain, which binds H3K9Me(2)  and H3K9Me(3)  with approximately equal affinities. We are interested in defining which elements of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler are necessary and sufficient for sliding nucleosomes. Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent machines that dynamically alter the chromatin packaging of eukaryotic genomes by assembling, sliding, and displacing nucleosomes. Ocular coloboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies associated with deafness (CHARGE) syndrome is a rare, usually sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations within the CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene, in nearly 70% of cases. Here we report that the chromodomain-containing protein CDYL specifically recognizes di- and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) and directly interacts with EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. Murine Chd1 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1), a chromodomain-containing chromatin remodeling protein, is necessary for embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Among those genes, zinc finger helicase (ZFH), also termed chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (Chd3), was one of the highly expressed transcripts in tentative cementoblasts. UNLABELLED: Emerging evidence implicates the chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) as a specific oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigate the function of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (chd7) during zebrafish somitogenesis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain-DNA-binding-protein 7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly condition which includes vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss. BACKGROUND: The CHD5 gene located on 1p36 encodes a protein-chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5. CHD5 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene candidate. Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. Previously, we have shown that the chromodomain protein Chriz and the zinc-finger protein Z4 are essentially required for the maintenance of polytene chromosome structure. In brain, Family with sequence similarity 174 member b (Fam174b) had increased expression in 318 females, whereas Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (Chd2-2) had reduced expression in 318 males. RESULTS: Here we demonstrated that chromobox protein homolog 3 (Cbx3) is crucial for SMC differentiation from stem cells and that the chromodomain and chromoshadow domain of Cbx3 are responsible for Cbx3-induced SMC differentiation. Fractionation of the extract identified a single protein, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (Chd1), capable of the remodeling activity. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) has been found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in malignant neural tumors. Similarly, CenH3-GFP distribution was altered in the absence of HP1, the chromodomain protein that binds to H3K9me3. ChIP-Seq reveals that KDM5B is predominantly targeted to intragenic regions and that it is recruited to H3K36me3 via an interaction with the chromodomain protein MRG15. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) is a regulator of the chromatin remodelling process. We determined the crystal structure of MPP8 chromodomain in complex with H3K9me3 peptide. On this gene the chromodomain protein HP1γ, frequently defined as a transcriptional repressor, facilitates inclusion of the alternative exons via a mechanism involving decreased RNA polymerase II elongation rate. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a core component of the NuRD complex and contains a nucleosome remodeling ATPase domain along with two chromodomains and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers. H3-Lys-9-Me2 interacts with the chromodomain of Swi6/HP1. The chromodomain (CD) of HP1 proteins specifically recognizes the methyl mark on H3 peptides, but the same extent of specificity is not observed within chromatin. We have performed simulations on models of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 complexed with a variety of histone H3 modifications. CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutation in the CHD7 gene, encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7. Molecular diagnostic testing for CHD7 mutation has been available in a clinical setting since 2005. In this work we identified Kismet, a chromodomain-containing protein of the SNF2-like family of ATPases, as a novel component of the hedgehog transcriptional repression mechanism in anterior compartment cells.

532083389b2d7acc7e000003	Are there drugs for Tick-borne Encephalitis?	 tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have been detected in Bulgaria. Considering the remarkable increase in TBE morbidity in Europe over the past two decades, we conducted a study of TBE among patients with acute viral meningitis who were hospitalised in Bulgaria during 2009 to 2012.  Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family primarily spread through arthropod vectors, and are the major causes of illness and death around the globe. The Flaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus (type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type species, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus diarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to propagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. Despite the extensive research and public health concern associated with flavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any flavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist.

531d7430267d7dd053000008	Which are the drugs utilized for the burning mouth syndrome?	On average, treatment with placebos produced a response that was 72% as large as the response to active drugs. The concomitant prescription of tongue protector and AV is effective for treating patients with BMS. We suggest that a subset of patients with BMS may be a phenotypic variant of RLS and a trial of dopaminergic drugs should be given in patients with BMS who has a history suggestive of RLS or in a patient who do not show a response to usual therapies for BMS. The systemic administration of Catuama reduces the symptoms of BMS and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. Topical clonazepam, which previous analyses of clinical evidence have shown to be the drug of choice for BMS, also proved to be the most cost-effective of the drugs analysed for this condition.

5523f1a62c8b63434a000002	Which mutations of phopspholamban have been found in patients with cardiomyopathy?	 In 19 of 142 patients (13%), the PLN founder mutation c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) was identified. PLN mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (p = 0.004), inverted T waves in leads V4 to V6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (p = 0.007) or functional (p = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities. Recently, we showed that the c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) mutation in the phospholamban (PLN) gene can be identified in 10-15 % of Dutch patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients.  The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC. R14del+ patients diagnosed with DCM showed an arrhythmogenic phenotype, and SCD at young age can be the presenting symptom. These findings support the concept of 'arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy'. Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse. Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart failure has been conducted. Two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L). One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). The fourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop). The genetic analysis was focused on R9C mutation with the ability to block PLN phosphorylation leading to chronic inhibition of SERCA2a activity. Another analysed mutation causing the alteration of PLN level in cells was related to the substitution of a leucine residue at position 39 with a premature stop codon (L39X).  A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death.  These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant.  We identified 1 family with a deletion of arginine 14 in the PLN. Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic with congestive heart failure.  Phospholamban R14 deletion results in late-onset, mild, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No homozygous individuals were identified. By middle age, heterozygous individuals developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases. Transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death. A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy. Here, a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. The heterozygous individuals exhibited hypertrophy without diminished contractile performance. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27.  Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes.  Phospholamban R14del mutation in patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: evidence supporting the concept of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The PLN -42 C>G mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	[['c.40_42delAGA(p.Arg14del)', 'PLN R14 del'], ['PLN L39stop', 'PLN R39X'], ['Arg(9) to Cys', 'R9C'], ['Arg(9) to Leu', 'R9L'], ['Arg(9) to His', 'R9H']]
52df8ce798d023950500000d	Which are the supplemental antioxidant in athletes?	Although these supplementations are increasingly used by master athletes, very few data are available on their effects on oxidative stress, muscle recovery, and physical performance. The potential benefits of supplement use in athletes are thus questionable. Some studies indicate no benefits, while others highlight potential negative side effects of vitamin supplementation.  These data indicate that RQ significantly reduces exercise-induced lipid peroxidation without associated changes in inflammation or plasma antioxidant status. Cr supplementation inhibited the increase of inflammation markers TNF-α and CRP, but not oxidative stress markers, due to acute exercise. Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent. Vitamins C and E supplementation had no significant effect on any of the studied parameters. Effects of the two treatments relative to placebo on mean performance in the incremental test and time trial were unclear, but runners faster by 1 SD of peak speed demonstrated a possible improvement on peak running speed with BC juice (1.9%; ±2.5%).  Training status correlates more strongly with antioxidant status than diet does Consequently, we can conclude that Biostimine supplementation reduces the postexercise level of TBARS by increasing the antioxidant activity of plasma but has no effect on inflammatory markers. Supplementation with Asx could prevent exercise induced free radical production and depletion of non-enzymatic antioxidant defense in young soccer players. In conclusion these results indicated that treatment with melatonin in acute sports exercise reversed oxidative stress, improved defenses and lipid metabolism, which would result in an improvement in fitness. CoQ(10) supplementation before strenuous exercise decreases the oxidative stress and modulates the inflammatory signaling, reducing the subsequent muscle damage. Heretofore, Cr's positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects. These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE. Nevertheless, based upon the growing evidence that many athletic populations are vitamin D deficient or insufficient, it is recommended that athletes monitor their serum vitamin D concentration and consult with their health care professional and/or nutritionist to determine if they would derive health benefits from vitamin D supplementation. This study examined the effects of 1,000 mg quercetin + 1,000 mg vitamin C (QC); 1,000 mg quercetin, 1,000 mg vitamin C, 400 mg isoquercetin, 30 mg epigallocatechin gallate, and 400 mg n-3 fatty acids (QFO) The two strains, L. rhamnosus IMC 501(®) and L. paracasei IMC 502(®), exert strong antioxidant activity. Athletes and all those exposed to oxidative stress may benefit from the ability of these probiotics to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species. These results indicate that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFAs significantly increased oxidative stress at rest and after a judo-training session. Rhodiola Rosea, is an adaptogen plant which has been reported to promote fatty acids utilisation, to ameliorate antioxidant function, and to improve body resistance to physical strenuous efforts.  Supplementation with antioxidant vitamin E to athletes at 267 mg (400 IUs) or greater has been reported to reduce levels of LP associated with exercise. Results obtained at the end of the study indicate that zinc supplementation prevents production of free radicals by activating the antioxidant system. The significant increase in the UI of erythrocyte membranes indicates the potential for harm, because a high intake of PUFA might increase susceptibility to lipid peroxidation not counterbalanced by a higher increase in TAA. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet seems to be the better choice. A number of clinical trials have successfully been performed using whey and/or soy proteins in the treatment of many diseases. They both have antioxidant properties, which appears to be a factor in aerobic physical performance as well.  The antioxidant effect of the two proteins is based on different mechanisms of action.

Crystallization of a paraspeckle protein PSPC1-NONO heterodimer difficult heterodimeric complex of two human proteins, paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) and non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), that are involved in gene regulation and the structural integrity of nuclear bodies termed paraspeckles is described. SFPQ (PSF) and NONO (p54) are nuclear proteins that interact with each other and have diverse roles in nucleic acids metabolism. The SFPQ/NONO heterodimer was previously found to enhance DNA strand break rejoining in vitro. We identified a heterodimer, p54nrb and PSF, P54nrb forms a heterodimer with PSP1 that localizes to paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent manner. e demonstrated that the PSF heterodimer partner, p54nrb (non-POU-domain-containing, octamer binding protein), can also function as a transcription corepressor, independent of PSF.

531376c8e3eabad021000012	which mutations of phospholamban gene have been found to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	one L39X nonsense mutation was identified in 1 of 1,064 HCM proband cases with a family history of HCM, previously found to be negative for the current HCM genetic test panel. This mutation cosegregated with incidence of HCM in a multigenerational family. The PLN -42 C>G mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  The PLN -42 C>G mutation is associated with a benign form of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this family, though the presence of a healthy adult carrier suggests that other genetic and environmental factors could be involved.  We found a heterozygous single nucleotide transition from A to G at -77-bp upstream of the transcription start site in the phospholamban promoter region of one patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the mutation, -77A-->G, increased the phospholamban promoter activity. No nucleotide change in the phospholamban coding region was found in 99 patients with cardiomyopathy. We suspect that the mutation plays an important role in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter).

5312280ce3eabad02100000a	Abnormalities in which chromosomes were linked to the Moyamoya disease?	Complex chromosome rearrangement of 6p25.3->p23 and 12q24.32->qter in a child with moyamoya. Routine karyotype demonstrated extra chromosomal material on 6p. Single nucleotide polymorphism microarray revealed a previously unreported complex de novo genetic rearrangement involving subtelomeric segments on chromosomes 6p and 12q. In terms of the genetics, recent literature suggests a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmission involving chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17 for familial MMD.  Furthermore, the current literature on familial MMD has pointed to a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmittance at loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17. Here, we report on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism.  We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB and BRCC3.  A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region.  Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5).  The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV).  Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics.  The gene responsible for NF1 is located on the chromosome region 17q11.2 and for familial moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.  Autosomal dominant moyamoya disease maps to chromosome 17q25.3. Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3. However, the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomal genotype showed that affected members had the same sequence of the Mitochondrial 3 portion of D-loop with Japanese patients.  Smith-Magenis syndrome and Moyamoya disease in a patient with del(17)(p11.2p13.1).

Moyamoya syndrome in a child with trisomy 12p syndrome. This report presents the first case of moyamoya syndrome with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12.  She had been prenatally diagnosed with trisomy 12p with a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 12 originating from her mother. She manifested developmental delay and some dysmorphic features of the face and limbs compatible with the clinical features of trisomy 12p. The genes encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 4 and TIMP2 span chromosomes 3p24.2-p26 and 17q25, respectively, which are the locations of familial moyamoya disease (FMMD) genes.  We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome with moyamoya syndrome. [Molecular screening for moyamoya disease by use of expressed sequence tag on chromosome 3p].  To identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with monoallelic expressions on chromosome 3, we used mouse A9 hybrid cells having human chromosome 3. Two ESTs showed only maternal expression in mouse A9 hybrid cells, and four showed non-expression in the lymphocytes derived from moyamoya patients.  A novel susceptibility locus for moyamoya disease on chromosome 8q23. Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q. In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.3).  Considering the function, we selected nine genes as candidates from a total of 65 genes identified in the 9-cM region of D17S785-D17S836 in chromosome 17q25, and performed sequence analysis on the DNA samples obtained from a pedigree of familial moyamoya disease, which showed a complete linkage to the region by a haplotype analysis.  Linkage of familial moyamoya disease (spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis) to chromosome 17q25. The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2. CONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17q25. Recent genetic studies suggest some responsible genetic foci in chromosomes 3, 6 and 17. To further specify the genetic component of moyamoya disease, a linkage study of moyamoya disease using markers on chromosome 6, where the HLA gene is located, was performed.  Mapping of a familial moyamoya disease gene to chromosome 3p24.2-p26. A linkage was found between the disease and markers located at 3p24.2-26. We postulate that a protein encoded on chromosome 21 may be related to the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.

54df69af1388e8454a000005	Which drugs are included in the FEC-75 regimen?	Fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC-75) followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab followed by FEC-75 plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (Z1041): a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment received fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC-75) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) once per week for 12 weeks, while those randomly assigned to the concurrent treatment group received paclitaxel and trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of FEC-75 (on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and once-weekly trastuzumab, in the same doses as the sequential group. In May 2008, the patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy consisting of 4 courses of FEC 75(fluororracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Stage II-IIIC HER2-positive breast cancer patients, including inflammatory disease, were treated with weekly-trastuzumab for 24 weeks administered concurrently with all primary chemotherapy containing paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks and 4 cycles of FEC-75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicine 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) followed by surgery.  Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.  BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe cardiac toxicity.  Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles).  The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles. Sixty chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of 30 to 71 years in age, P.S. = 0-1, receiving 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC 75) q 21 days or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 120 mg/m2 epirubicin or high dose mitomycin-methotrexate-mitoxantrone (MMM) q 14 days (+ G-CSF) or 100 mg/m2 epirubicin (+ G-CSF) were randomized to receive, 15 min before chemotherapy, 8 mg i.v. bolus of ondansetron or 3 mg i.v. granisetron or 5 mg i.v. tropisetron and no further antiemetic therapy in the following days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization. The aim of this study, using a Fleming single-stage design, was to explore the efficacy and safety of Taxotere 100 x mg x m(-2) docetaxel and FEC 75 cyclophosphamide 500 mg x m(-2), fluorouracil 500 x mg x m(-2) and epirubicin 75 mg x m(-2), in alternating and sequential schedules for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). We studied the feasibility of FEC (75) (fluorouracil: 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin: 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide:500 mg/m(2), q 3 w, 6 cycles) as adjuvant chemotherapy for 59 primary breast cancer patients.

56f3f0f02ac5ed1459000017	Which are the most widely used computational methods for the identification of CRMs (cis-regulatory modules)?	Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs). However, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs. In this work we present CisMiner, a novel methodology to detect putative CRMs by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. CisMiner allows to perform a blind search of CRMs without any prior information about target CRMs nor limitation in the number of motifs. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. To be able to handle the large datasets, the query-based setting and other specificities proper to CRM detection on ChIP-Seq based data, we developed a novel powerful CRM detection method 'CPModule' the optimal choice of method varies depending on species and composition of the sequences in question. When discriminating CRMs from non-coding regions, those methods considering evolutionary conservation have a stronger predictive power than methods designed to be run on a single genome. Different CRM representations and search strategies rely on different CRM properties, and different methods can complement one another. For example, some favour homotypical clusters of binding sites, while others perform best on short CRMs. Furthermore, most methods appear to be sensitive to the composition and structure of the genome to which they are applied.  CisMiner: genome-wide in-silico cis-regulatory module prediction by fuzzy itemset mining Additionally, we make a number of new predictions on combinatorial regulation of these five key TFs with other TFs documented in TRANSFAC. Due to degeneracy of nucleotide content among binding site instances or motifs, and intricate &apos;grammatical organization&apos; of motifs within cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), extant pattern matching-based in silico motif search methods often suffer from impractically high false positive rates, especially in the context of analyzing large genomic datasets, and noisy position weight matrices which characterize binding sites Genome-wide identification of cis-regulatory motifs and modules underlying gene coregulation using statistics and phylogeny. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. It can identify &apos;orthologous&apos; CRMs without multiple alignments. These methods are problematic when binding sites are not well aligned in multiple alignments or when the number of input known motifs is large. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs. We thus developed a new CRM identification method MOPAT (motif pair tree), which identifies CRMs through the identification of motif modules, groups of motifs co-occurring in multiple CRMs.	[['motif conservation'], ['fuzzy itemset mining'], ['combinatorial methods']]
5156be75d24251bc05000088	Which diseases is microRNA 132 (miR-132) implicated in?	Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNA are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy. Inflammation, stress signalling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes a chronic immuno-inflammatory response in the eye that may result in corneal neovascularization during blinding immunopathological lesion stromal keratitis (SK). miR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that is induced in endothelial cells in response to growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). miR-132 expression was up-regulated (10- to 20-fold) after ocular infection with HSV, an event that involved the production of both VEGF-A and IL-17. The anti-angiogenic effect of antagomir-132 was reflected by a reduction in angiogenic Ras activity in corneal CD31-enriched cells (presumably blood vessel endothelial cells) during SK. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of miRNA involvement in an infectious ocular disease. Manipulating miRNA expression holds promise as a therapeutic approach to control an ocular lesion that is an important cause of human blindness. Role of miR-132 in angiogenesis The cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated microRNA miR-132 was significantly down-regulated in both the schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identified 26 genes up-regulated in schizophrenia subjects. Our data suggest miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments. Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain.

57169b63cb4ef8864c00000b	Which are the human glutamate transporters?	The density of EAAC1 (EAAT3) glutamate transporters expressed by neurons in the mammalian CNS. Glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) are the most abundant subtypes and are essential for the functioning of the mammalian CNS, but the contribution of the EAAC1 subtype in the clearance of synaptic glutamate has remained controversial, because the density of this transporter in different tissues has not been determined. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral.  Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST. In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites. Reticulon RTN2B regulates trafficking and function of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1. Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when induced Here we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determined Reduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (<10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transporters Position of the third Na+ site in the aspartate transporter GltPh and the human glutamate transporter, EAAT1. We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP. Glutamate receptors and transporters, including T1R1 and T1R3 (taste receptor 1, subtypes 1 and 3), mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors), EAAC-1 (excitatory amino acid carrier-1), GLAST-1 (glutamate-aspartate transporter-1), and GLT-1 (glutamate transporter-1), are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract The ASCTs (alanine, serine, and cysteine transporters) belong to the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1), which also includes the human glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPh As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST) GLT-1, Glutamate Transporter 1, same as excitatory amino acid transporter 2; Glu, glutamate Multiple Functions of Glutamate Uptake via Meningococcal GltT-GltM l-Glutamate ABC Transporter in Neisseria meningitidis Internalization into Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between family members, ASCTs function quite differently from the EAATs and GltPh.  First, Li(+) cannot support transport by EAAT2, whereas it can support transport by the other excitatory amino acid transporters, and second, EAAT2 is sensitive to a wider range of blockers than other subtypes.  hGLT-1 and hGLuT-1 mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the brain, while hEAAC1 mRNA expression (3.8 kb and 2,4 kb) was strongest in peripheral organs.  Identification of functional domains of the human glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 is different from other subtypes in two respects.  DNA methylation dependent silencing of the human glutamate transporter EAAT2 gene in glial cells. We have investigated the functional impact of a naturally occurring mutation of the human glutamate transporter GLT1 (EAAT2), which had been detected in a patient with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP. Using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analysis of concatenated transporters, and chemical cross-linking, we demonstrated that human and prokaryotic glutamate transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or in mammalian cells are assembled as trimers composed of three identical subunits. Five glutamate transporters in the human brain (EAAT1-5) are present on both astroglia and neurons. We characterize the profile of three different human astroglial progenitors in vitro: human glial restricted precursors (HGRP), human astrocyte precursors (HAPC), and early-differentiated astrocytes. They are known to be multimers; however, the number of subunits forming a functional transporter is controversial. We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP.

Stains-All (ISA) staining method for phosphoproteins in SDS-PAGE was described.  Pro-Q Diamond stain Quantitative proteome analyses suggest that the well-established stain colloidal Coomassie Blue, when used as an infrared dye, may provide sensitive, post-electrophoretic in-gel protein detection that can rival even Sypro Ruby. Several new fast staining protocols for the visualization of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE utilizing Coomassie Blue staining (CBS) have been described in literature.  The CyDye family of fluorescent dyes is currently the overwhelming choice for applications in proteomic analysis, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) his enables the co-detection of phosphoproteins as well as total proteins from the same gel and is accomplished by utilizing two different fluorescent stains, the ProQ-Diamond, which stains only phosphorylated proteins, and Sypro Ruby, which stains the entire subset of proteins. Detection of the resulting protein maps relies on staining (i.e. colloidal coomassie blue (CCB) or SYPRO Ruby (SR), in addition to many others). Fluorescent in-gel protein stains are generally preferred for higher sensitivity, reduced background, and wider dynamic range. Commonly used staining methods with excellent mass spectrometry compatibility are coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) or fluorescent dyes. The typical concentration of protein loaded varies from 0.13 to 1.40 μg/μL for a classical silver staining method in 2DE gel Silver staining is widely used to detect protein in polyacrylamide gels when high sensitivity is required.

55391ce8bc4f83e828000018	Which signaling pathways have been associated with medulloblastoma formation and growth?	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is an important factor in growth and patterning during embryonic development. A mutation in Patched, Smoothened or Gli1, which regulate the Hh signaling pathway, might lead to the onset of glioblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma These data indicate that inhibition of Aurora Kinase A inhibits cell growth in medulloblastoma through inhibition of pro-proliferative signaling pathways Wnt, Myc, and RB Multiple signaling pathways have been associated with medulloblastoma formation and growth. These include the developmental pathways Hedgehog, (Hh) Notch, and Wnt as well as the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) c-Met, erbB2, IGF-R and TrkC, and the oncoprotein Myc Activation of neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC induces apoptosis in medulloblastomas Elevated expression of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor TrkC by childhood medulloblastomas is associated with favorable clinical outcome Considered collectively, these results support the conclusion that the biological actions of TrkC activation affect medulloblastoma outcome by inhibiting tumor growth through the promotion of apoptosis. During development, proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), candidate cells-of-origin for the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, requires signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the pathways of which are also implicated in medulloblastoma. Sonic hedgehog and insulin-like growth factor signaling synergize to induce medulloblastoma formation from nestin-expressing neural progenitors in mice. Ectopic expression of alpha and beta interferons in the developing brain also induces Shh-mediated medulloblastoma formation, suggesting a possible role for antiviral response in the genesis of medulloblastoma. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor. Sunitinib induces apoptosis and growth arrest of medulloblastoma tumor cells by inhibiting STAT3 and AKT signaling pathways. Aberrant activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways is associated with human medulloblastomas. N-myc can substitute for insulin-like growth factor signaling in a mouse model of sonic hedgehog-induced medulloblastoma. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor Aberrant expression/activation of EGFR is found in multiple human cancers, including medulloblastoma, the most prevalent pediatric brain cancer, and often has been associated with metastasis, poor prognosis, and resistance to chemotherapy We emphasize the cancer-relevance of cilia-dependent signaling pathways and proteins including mTOR, VHL, TSC, WNT, Aurora-A, NEDD9, and Hedgehog, and highlight the emerging role of ciliary dysfunction in renal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer Here, we show that in medulloblastoma cells, both EGF and ouabain activate Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling Expression level of tumor/metastasis suppressive miRNAs in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas is likely to determine their response to treatment, and thus, these miRNAs would be important biomarkers for risk stratification within the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas. Aberrant activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways is associated with human medulloblastomas Shh-dependent medulloblastoma formation is enhanced by hyperactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and ectopic expression of Myc oncogenes Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signaling is activated in medulloblastoma cell proliferation and is associated with reduced expression of PTEN. A number of miRNAs like miR-193a, miR-224/miR-452 cluster, miR-182/miR-183/miR-96 cluster, and miR-148a having potential tumor/metastasis suppressive activity were found to be overexpressed in the WNT signaling associated medulloblastomas The requirement for SHH-Gli signaling in the growth of the mouse brain, together with the ability of inappropriate pathway activation in the cerebellum to cause medulloblastomas, and the inhibition of the growth of a number of brain tumors with cyclopamine, a SHH signaling inhibitor, underscores the critical role of the SHH-GLI pathway in brain growth and tumor formation Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor Distinctive microRNA signature of medulloblastomas associated with the WNT signaling pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients randomized in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial (n = 14 264) were grouped by baseline AF category: paroxysmal or persistent. Multivariable adjustment was performed to compare thrombo-embolic events, bleeding, and death between groups, in high-risk subgroups, and across treatment assignment (rivaroxaban or warfarin).  This review focuses on the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world settings are underway.  Rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in East Asian patients from the ROCKET AF trial. CONCLUSIONS: Observed relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin were similar among patients within and outside East Asia.  Rivaroxaban versus warfarin in Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in relation to the CHADS2 score: a subgroup analysis of the J-ROCKET AF trial. BACKGROUND: Results from a trial of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in 1280 Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation (J-ROCKET AF) revealed that rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the principal safety outcome.  Rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa-inhibitor was non-inferior to adjusted dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and embolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ROCKET-AF trial and has been approved for stroke prevention in AF. The ROCKET AF trial compared rivaroxaban (20 mg/day; 15 mg/day in patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in 14,264 patients with AF and a prior history of stroke or at least two other additional risk factors for stroke. Factors associated with major bleeding events: insights from the ROCKET AF trial (rivaroxaban once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation). In Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) trial, rivaroxaban was noninferior to dose-adjusted warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at moderate to high stroke risk. Different clinical trials have shown the benefits of new oral anticoagulants over warfarin, but patients included in the ROCKET-AF trial were found to be at a higher risk of AF-related complications. The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, with a similar rate of major bleeding and a substantial reduction in intracranial hemorrhage. Rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a critical review of the ROCKET AF trial. Outcomes after cardioversion and atrial fibrillation ablation in patients treated with rivaroxaban and warfarin in the ROCKET AF trial. The overall analysis of the rivaroxaban versus warfarin in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation (J-ROCKET AF) trial revealed that rivaroxaban was not inferior to warfarin with respect to the primary safety outcome.

To determine the potential of an integrated, image-based computer-aided design (CAD) and 3-dimensional (3D) printing approach to engineer scaffolds for head and neck cartilaginous reconstruction for auricular and nasal reconstruction. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds was performed in a porcine model. Auricular and nasal constructs with several types of microporous architecture were rapidly manufactured with high fidelity to human patient anatomy. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth. Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds demonstrated native-appearing cartilaginous growth that respected the boundaries of the scaffold.CONCLUSION: Integrated, image-based CAD and 3D printing processes generated patient-specific nasal and auricular scaffolds that supported cartilage regeneration. A prototype meniscus cartilage was prepared to illustrate the potential application in bioengineering. As a proof of concept, we generated a bionic ear via 3D printing of a cell-seeded hydrogel matrix in the anatomic geometry of a human ear, along with an intertwined conducting polymer consisting of infused silver nanoparticles. This allowed for in vitro culturing of cartilage tissue around an inductive coil antenna in the ear, which subsequently enables readout of inductively-coupled signals from cochlea-shaped electrodes. The printed ear exhibits enhanced auditory sensing for radio frequency reception, and complementary left and right ears can listen to stereo audio music.

Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder that occurs in an endogamous group of Vlax Roma (Gypsies; refs. 1-3).  The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter. The CCFDN syndrome is a complex phenotype involving multiple systems, characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital cataracts, microcorneae, delayed early motor and intellectual development, hypogonadotrop hypogonadism, hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, and serious complications related to general anaesthesia.  Developmental abnormalities include congenital cataracts and microcorneae, primary hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, impaired physical growth, delayed early motor and intellectual development, mild facial dysmorphism and hypogonadism. Para-infectious rhabdomyolysis is a serious complication reported in an increasing number of patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy.  All patients showed a peripheral, demyelinating neuropathy and varying degrees of ataxia. In the older patients, muscular atrophy in distal muscles and facial dysmorphism was evident. Early-onset bilateral congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil could be found in all patients. All children had floppy eyelid syndrome and pseudoptosis. All patients had syndrome-associated nystagmus and congenital esotropia. Distant visual acuity could be classified as severe to moderate impairment, whereas near visual acuity was much better (mild to moderate impairment). Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder.  Peripheral nerve abnormalities in the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome. Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a novel developmental disorder in Gypsies maps to 18qter. We propose to refer to the syndrome as congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN).  The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features.  Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy.  Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a rare cause of parainfectious rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy. The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder. Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter	[['congenital cataracts'], ['facial dysmorphism'], ['peripheral neuropathy']]
5517f9286487737b43000002	Which are the different proteins/isoforms encoded but the ASPH (aspartate beta-hydroxylase) gene in humans?	The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing. The human AbetaH-J-J locus is a genomic sequence which generates three functionally distinct proteins, the enzyme aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase (AbetaH), the structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum junctin, and the membrane-bound calcium binding protein junctate. Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) hydroxylates Asp and Asn residues within EGF-like domains of Notch and Jagged, which mediate cell motility and differentiation. This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells. Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctate is a newly identified integral ER/SR membrane calcium binding protein, which is an alternative splicing form of the same gene generating aspartyl beta-hydroxylase and junctin. Screening a mouse heart cDNA library using canine junctin cDNA as a probe yielded three complete mouse heart cDNAs. One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate. Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously. A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized. The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3.0 and 4.2kb. Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly. The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized. The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain. Evolutionary conservation of this noncatalytic isoform of BAH (humbug) is demonstrated in mouse, man, and Drosophila. The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing Multiple levels of control of the expression of the human A beta H-J-J locus encoding aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase, junctin, and junctate.

The increasing role of metabolomics in system biology is driving the development of tools for comprehensive analysis of high-resolution NMR spectral datasets. Proteomics technology, a major component of system biology, has gained comprehensive attention in the area of medical diagnosis, drug development, and mechanism research. Metabolomics complements other omics, such as transcriptomics and proteomics and since it is a 'downstream' result of gene expression, changes in the metabolome is considered to best reflect the activities of the cell at a functional level.  In addition, integrated applications with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics provide greater understanding of global system biology. From proteomics to integrated omics towards system biology. In recent years, in the post genomic era, more and more data is being generated by biological high throughput technologies, such as proteomics and transcriptomics.

5318367cb166e2b806000012	List causative genes for autosomal recessive forms of monogenic Parkinson's disease	Mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are the major cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism. Early onset PD (EOPD) is particularly associated with autosomal recessive (AR) mutations, and three genes, PARK2, PARK7 and PINK1, have been found to carry mutations leading to AR disease.  Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene are causative of autosomal recessive, early onset Parkinson's disease.  Mutations in other genes, including ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBX07 (PARK15), cause more rare forms of recessive parkinsonism with very early-onset (<30 years) In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7), oss-of-function mutations in Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism with early-onset. mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset. mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.

530cf4e0c8a0b4a00c000004	Which mutations of alpha-myosin heavy chain gene are implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	Accordingly, pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was induced in 2-month-old, male mice with and without a FHC (R403Q) mutation in α-myosin heavy chain. This model (designated TnI-203/MHC-403) was generated by crossbreeding mice with the Gly203Ser cardiac troponin I (TnI-203) and Arg403Gln alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC-403) FHC-causing mutations.  Male but not female mice carrying a single R403Q missense allele for cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) and F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+), respectively) develop significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) compared with male and female wild-type mice (M-alphaMHC(+/+) and F-alphaMHC(+/+), respectively) after approximately 30 wk of age. A Q1065H mutation was detected in 1 of 21 HCM probands and was absent in 2 unaffected offspring. To understand further the pathogenesis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we determined how the cardiomyopathy induced by an Arg403-->Gln missense mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (403) is affected by chronically enhancing sympathetic drive by mating the mice with those overexpressing G(s)alpha (G(s)alpha x403).  A mouse model of FHC resulting from a mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy-chain (Arg403Gln) was used to study the electrophysiologic phenotype of this disease. We used small-amplitude (0.25%) length-perturbation analysis to examine the mechanical properties of skinned left ventricular papillary muscle strips from mouse hearts bearing the R403Q mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC403/+). Genetically-manipulated mice harboring an alpha-myosin heavy chain Arg403Gln missense mutation (alpha-MHC403/+) display a phenotype characteristic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). A new mouse cardiac electrophysiology method was used to study mice harboring an alpha-myosin heavy chain Arg403Gln missense mutation (alpha-MHC403/+), which results in histological and hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) and sudden death of uncertain etiology during exercise.  The introduction of the mouse model for FHC (the mouse expresses predominantly alpha-MHC as opposed to the beta-isoform in larger mammals) created a new paradigm for FHC based on finding enhanced motor function for R403Q alpha-MHC. A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) was generated by the introduction of an Arg 403 --> Gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. Biochemical analysis of one FHC mutant (Arg-249-->Gln) demonstrates that the structures formed by the mutant are solubilized at a lower ionic strength than those formed by wild-type MHC. We conclude that although the FHC mutant MHC is not labile, its assembly properties may be impaired.	[['R403Q', 'Arg403Gln'], ['Q1065H'], ['Arg-249-->Gln']]

530cefaaad0bf1360c000003	What are the names of anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that is used for treatment of multiple sclerosis patients?	Alemtuzumab offers induction strategy for very active relapsing MS patients who have failed conventional therapy, and possibly selected treatment-naive patients. Differential reconstitution of T cell subsets following immunodepleting treatment with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 mAb) provides long-lasting disease activity suppression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, increased the risk of thyroid dysfunction in CAMMS223, a phase 2 trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a), in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFNβ-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the CD52 protein present at high levels on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. In clinical trials, alemtuzumab has shown a clinical benefit superior to that of interferon-β in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. These results potentially help explain the level of immunocompetence observed in alemtuzumab-treated MS patients. Alemtuzumab was first used in multiple sclerosis in 1991. It is a monoclonal antibody which is directed against CD52, a protein of unknown function on lymphocytes.  Against an active comparator and the current first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (interferon-beta), alemtuzumab showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate as well as a significant reduction in the accumulation of disability.  Alemtuzumab (previously known as Campath(®)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes that results in lymphopenia and subsequent modification of the immune repertoire.  Compared to interferon beta-1a, alemtuzumab reduced the relapse rate by 49%-74% (P < 0.0001), and in two studies it reduced the risk of sustained disability accumulation by 42%-71% (P < 0.01). In one study (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis; CARE-MS1), there was no significant difference compared to interferon, perhaps reflecting the surprisingly low frequency of disability events in the comparator group. Alemtuzumab has been submitted for licensing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States and Europe. Alemtuzumab was associated with a greater chance of improved contrast sensitivity in patients with RRMS and may delay the worsening of visual function.  The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduced disease activity in a phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Alemtuzumab's consistent safety profile and benefit in terms of reductions of relapse support its use for patients with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, benefit in terms of disability endpoints noted in previous trials was not observed here.  Alemtuzumab, formally known as Campath-1H, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a protein on the surface of lymphocytes and monocytes with unknown function. A single dose of alemtuzumab leads to a rapid, profound and prolonged lymphopenia. A Phase II trial has shown that alemtuzumab reduces the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability by over 70% compared with interferon beta in patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Alemtuzumab, targeting CD52 expressed on T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and macrophages, has also shown to be effective in early RRMS and phase III trials are currently ongoing.  monoclonal antibody therapy has provided the opportunity to rationally direct the therapeutic intervention by specifically targeting mechanisms of the immune system such as CD52 (alemtuzumab), CD25 (daclizumab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and CD20 (rituximab) Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, a broadly expressed cell surface molecule on immune cells. Alemtuzumab-treatment of MS patients with relapsing-remitting forms of the disease significantly reduced the risk of relapse and accumulation of disability compared to interferon β-1a treatment in a phase II trial.  Alemtuzumab (CD52-specific humanized monoclonal antibody) was found to be an effective therapy for treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  Alemtuzumab effectively reduced relapse rates and improved clinical scores in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis not controlled by interferon therapy. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody with remarkable efficacy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).  The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduces disease activity in previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  For patients with first-line treatment-refractory relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab could be used to reduce relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability.  Campath-1H causes the immune response to change from the Th1 phenotype, suppressing multiple sclerosis disease activity, but permitting the generation of antibody-mediated thyroid autoimmunity. Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation. Campath 1-H (Alemtuzumab) is a humanised monoclonal antibody which targets the CD52 antigen, a low molecular weight glycoprotein present on the surface of most lymphocyte lineages, causing complement mediated lysis and rapid and prolonged T lymphocyte depletion. Following encouraging initial data from other centres we report our open label experience of using Campath 1-H as a treatment in aggressive relapsing multiple sclerosis in a consecutive series of 39 highly selected patients treated across three regional centres and followed for a mean of 1.89 years. Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 on lymphocytes and monocytes, may be an effective treatment for early multiple sclerosis.  In patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab was more effective than interferon beta-1a but was associated with autoimmunity, most seriously manifesting as immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, is a highly promising agent currently being studied in two phase III clinical trials. In this review, data from the recently published phase II clinical trial in the treatment of early relapsing remitting MS is summarized and analyzed in light of the development of alemtuzumab for MS and its potential role in treating this disease is discussed. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52, an antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant lymphocytes. It is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  To assess the effect of systemic lymphocyte depletion on disease activity, seven patients with MS received a 10-day intravenous course of the humanised monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H (anti-CDw52). The effect of CAMPATH-1H on disease activity provides direct, but preliminary, evidence that disease activity in MS depends on the availability of circulating lymphocytes and can be prevented by lymphocyte depletion. The elective treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis, using a humanized anti-leukocyte (CD52) monoclonal antibody (Campath-1H), has illuminated mechanisms that underlie the clinical course of the disease.  Alemtuzumab is currently under review to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, based on positive Phase II and Phase III trials in both treatment-naïve and treated relapsing MS patients.  Alemtuzumab has recently been approved by the European authorities for active relapsing MS, in essence as a first-line agent. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52.

5319abe4b166e2b80600002e	Which transcription factors are involved in E-cadherin repression during EMT?	ifferential role of Snail1 and Snail2 zinc fingers in E-cadherin repression and epithelial to mesenchymal transition nail1 (Snail) and Snail2 (Slug) are transcription factors that share a similar DNA binding structure of four and five C2H2 zinc finger motifs (ZF), respectively. Both factors bind specifically to a subset of E-box motifs (E2-box: CAGGTG/CACCTG) in target promoters like the E-cadherin promoter and are key mediators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). hrombin induces slug-mediated E-cadherin transcriptional repression and the parallel up-regulation of N-cadherin by a transcription-independent mechanism in RPE cells We demonstrate, for the first time, that thrombin induces E-cadherin repression by stimulating snail-2 (SLUG) transcription factor expression, Mutation of the putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites (S92/96A or S100/104A) enhanced the Slug/Snail2-mediated EMT properties of E-cadherin repression and vimentin induction, compared with wild-type Slug/Snail2. xpression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is often lost due to promoter DNA methylation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), Here, we identified that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA methylation.  We showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC. 9a interacts with Snail and is critical for Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression in human breast cancer Here, we have determined that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of E-cadherin in three TGF-β-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell lines. Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation. Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis. ZEB1, which targets E-cadherin repression, is a transcriptional regulator that has been implicated in EMT, and is associated with uterine and colorectal cancers. The introduction or knockdown of ZEB1 expression in bladder carcinoma cell lines showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasive potential, respectively. However, in vitro assays showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasion after the introduction or reduction of ZEB1, respectively, in transfected bladder cell lines. Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis. unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion. In most carcinomas, transcriptional repression has emerged as the main mechanism responsible for E-cadherin downregulation. Here, we report the identification of class I bHLH factor E2-2 (TCF4/ITF2) as a new EMT regulator. E-cadherin repression mediated by E2-2 is indirect and independent of proximal E-boxes of the promoter. Knockdown studies indicate that E2-2 expression is dispensable for maintenance of the EMT driven by Snail1 and E47. Slug mRNA was shown to be over-expressed in adenocarcinoma and inversely correlated to E-cadherin expression. Overexpression of Slug in OE33 mediated E-cadherin repression and induced the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin. SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression. eltaEF1 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and regulates epithelial plasticity in breast cancer cells ownregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression. Using the EpFosER mammary tumour model we show that during EMT, upregulation of the transcriptional regulator deltaEF1 coincided with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT. Analysis of E-cadherin promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified deltaEF1 as direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human cancer cells, transcript levels of deltaEF1 correlated directly with the extent of E-cadherin repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of deltaEF1 in cancer cells was sufficient to derepress E-cadherin expression and restore cell to cell adhesion, suggesting that deltaEF1 is a key player in late stage carcinogenesis. TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1 promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression.  ETV5 modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in endometrial cell lines.	[['Snail1 (Snail)'], ['Snail2 (Slug)'], ['Zeb1'], ['Twist'], ['SIP1'], ['DeltaEF1']]
54ff30dc6ad7dcbc1200000f	List human diseases involving genomic imprinting.	 Here we describe the clinical case of a female patient with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a genomic imprinting disorder Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases, including the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, associated with aberrant foetal growth. Perturbed imprinted gene expression is also implicated in the neuro-developmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. This epigenetic "life cycle" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome and Hydatidiform mole. In the neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed. eregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases as gestation trophoblastic disease, Prader-Willi, Angelmann and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes and plays significant role in the carcinogenesis. Angelman's syndrome families, which are known to be imprinted.  Deregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes and cancer. Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon whereby some genes preferentially produce mRNA transcripts from the gene copy derived from the parent of a specific sex. It has been implicated in a number of human diseases (most of them of endocrine interest), such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, transient neonatal diabetes, the focal form of nesidioblastosis, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. imprinting disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci.  Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], malignancy [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): Nat Genet 4:110-113], and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [Julier et al.

The strongest associations were for mood swings (OR 20.9, 95%CI 16.2-27.0), memory loss/lack of concentration (OR 19.6, 95% CI 15.5-24.8), night sweats (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.5-15.2), general fatigue (OR 9.6, 95% CI 8.3-11.1) and sexual dysfunction (OR 4.6, 95%CI 3.2-6.6). The symptoms include incapacitating fatigue, musculoskeletel and joint pains, headaches, neuropsychiatric disorders, affect changes, confusion, visual problems, changes of gait, loss of memory, lymphadenopathies, respiratory impairment, impotence, and urinary tract morphological and functional alterations.  In early 1992, U.S. troops returning from the Gulf War began reporting a variety of nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, skin rash, headache, muscle and joint pain, and loss of memory. These reports marked the beginning of what was to be identified as the Gulf War Syndrome (GWS).  We report on a 29-year-old man who suffered from dysmnesia, disturbance of orientation, cognitive impairment, and double vision. His history revealed several front-line operations in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War.  Neuropsychological tests disclosed severe cognitive impairment especially concerning memory. A cluster of common health problems included: skin rash, cough, depression, unintentional weight loss, insomnia, and memory problems. Syndromes 1 ("impaired cognition," characterized by problems with attention, memory, and reasoning, as well as insomnia, depression, daytime sleepiness, and headaches), 2 ("confusion-ataxia," characterized by problems with thinking, disorientation, balance disturbances, vertigo, and impotence), and 3 ("arthro-myo-neuropathy," characterized by joint and muscle pains, muscle fatigue, difficulty lifting, and extremity paresthesias) represented strongly clustered symptoms; whereas, syndromes 4 ("phobia-apraxia"), 5 ("fever-adenopathy"), and 6 ("weakness-incontinence") involved weaker clustering and mostly overlapped syndromes 2 and 3.

Treatment with purine analogues and alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and improved survival.   Treatment with purine analogs and the monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab has resulted in significantly higher response rates and increased survival. Nelarabine is an effective regimen against indolent leukemias, and combining it with fludarabine was most promising. Determination of tumor cell ara-GTP levels may provide a predictive test for response to nelarabine. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia has an aggressive course with short median survival and poor response to chemotherapy. With the use of the purine analogue pentostatin more than half of patients will have a major response and a minority will have a complete remission, usually lasting months.  T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is a rare post-thymic T-cell malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. It has generally been resistant to alkylating chemotherapy, but some effect has been observed with the purine analog 2-deoxycoformicin with documented partial or complete response rates in up to 45% of patients. Fifteen patients with T-PLL, most of whom had received the purine analog deoxycoformycin (DCF), were treated with CAMPATH-1H. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies. Trials using DCF or other purine analogues alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in front-line or salvage therapy are warranted to improve the prognosis of patients with prolymphocytic leukemia.

5311b99ae3eabad021000004	Which medical diagnostic tests are used to test kidney function?	kidney dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are diagnosed by the evaluation of changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations.  Renal biomarkers, especially those present in urine, may be useful for the study of both acute and chronic nephropathies. The International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) canine AKI grading system and the implementation of urinary biomarkers Decreased tryptophan (TRP) and increased kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in blood have been reported in patients and experimental animals with renal diseases. Acute kidney injury was defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50% or more from the beginning of vancomycin therapy.   In critically ill children, the development of reversible AKI during vancomycin therapy is associated with administration of nephrotoxic drugs and an elevated BUN: Scr ratio. The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR. After kidney donation, renal function measured by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine of all donors returned to normal within one week, and no serious complications were noticed.  In living kidney donors GFR is not significantly correlated with age or sex. Increased proteinuria would lead to a larger risk for renal failure in the long term A reduction of proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease was observed during the 4-month treatment with pioglitazone which continued for 2 months after the cessation of the treatment. However, 4 months after the cessation of the treatment, a little increase was detected in the level of proteinuria.

We also found digestive malformations (7.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.7%), and maternofetal infections (3.7%). A potential association with placental abnormalities and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed Our data suggests an inverse relationship between the maternal BMI and the detection of fetal EIF and/or EB Fetal echogenic bowel at 17 weeks' gestational age as the early and only sign of a very long segment of Hirschsprung disease. fetal ultrasound findings associated with intrauterine cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection the combination of hydrops fetalis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hyperechoic bowel should raise the possibility of a CMV infection strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome due to utero-placental insufficiency, particularly in women with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration due to severe feto-maternal bleeding Congenital cytomegalovirus infection presenting with echogenic bowel and oligohydramnios. Five cases of trisomy 21 and one case of trisomy 18 were detected Brightly echogenic bowel in the second trimester was found to be associated with a significant risk of fetal aneuploidy. echogenic bowel does not uniformly herald an abnormal outcome. Echogenic bowel coexistent with other abnormalities (such as growth deficiency or structural malformations) may be a comarker for aneuploidy. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection with oligohydramnios and echogenic bowel at 14 weeks' gestation Parental CF carrier testing and amniocentesis to identify aneuploidy or fetal CF status has a high positive ascertainment rate in fetuses with echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3.

51630226298dcd4e5100004d	What are the advantages of the top down mass spectrometric analysis of histones?	recent advances in MS technology, such as high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)-mass spectrometry, have permitted the study of intact proteins and their modifications. On-line and off-line protein separation instruments coupled to FTICR-MS allow the characterization of PTMs previously undetectable with bottom-up approaches. With just ∼24 μg on-column of core histones (H4, H2B, H2A, and H3) purified from human fibroblasts, 41 H4 isoforms were identified, with the type and location of PTMs unambiguously mapped for 20 of these variants. Our results indicated that dH1 is extensively modified by phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation and ubiquitination, with most PTMs falling in the N-terminal domain Optimized for the intricacies of whole proteins, new software modules visualize proteome-scale data based on the LC retention time and intensity of intact masses and enable selective detection of PTMs to automatically screen for acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. our UHPLC-MS approach for histone profiling offers a sensitive and reproducible tool that will be of great value for exploring PTMs and variants This work demonstrates the power of top-down MS for a detailed structural confirmation of recombinant proteins, even without prior information on aa substitutions or modifications. Top and Middle Down MS were utilized to identify the most commonly occurring combinatorially modified forms. In this paper we investigate the application of spectral alignment to the problem of identifying protein forms in top-down mass spectra (i.e., identifying the modifications, mutations, insertions, and deletions). This work represents the most comprehensive analysis of histone H4 forms present in human cells reported to date. Metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H4 is progressively methylated at K20 during the G(2), M, and G(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible. The "top down" mass spectrometry approach detected dramatic decreases in acetylation on H3 and H2B in gcn5Delta cells versus wild type. In sum, we have defined the "basis set" of histone forms present in yeast chromatin using a current mass spectrometric approach that both quickly profiles global changes and directly probes the connectivity of modifications on the same histone. Recent developments in top down mass spectrometry have enabled closely related histone variants and their modified forms to be identified and quantitated with unprecedented precision, facilitating efforts to better understand how histones contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and other nuclear processes. This unequivocal identification of H2A forms illustrates the advantages of Top Down Mass Spectrometry and provides a global perspective of H2A regulation through the cell cycle. The modification of H3 in asynchronous HeLa cells was profiled using Top Down Mass Spectrometry. The basis set of protein forms expressed by human cells from the H2B gene family was determined by Top Down Mass Spectrometry. To help crack this code more efficiently, we demonstrate a new strategy for protein characterization wherein complete PTM descriptions are obtained by database retrieval instead of manual interpretation of information-rich data from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).

55451e53bf90a13052000003	Which proteins act as factors that promote transcription-coupled repair in bacteria?	Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is involved in correcting UV-induced damage and other road-blocks encountered in the transcribed strand. Mutation frequency decline (Mfd) is a transcription repair coupling factor, involved in repair of template strand during transcription. the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP. We report observations suggesting that the transcription elongation factor NusA promotes a previously unrecognized class of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) in addition to its previously proposed role in recruiting translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to gaps encountered during transcription. NusA participates in an alternative class of TCR involved in the identification and removal of a class of lesion, such as the N(2)-f-dG lesion Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Transcription-coupled repair, the targeted repair of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD26 and ERCC6, respectively. The effect of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, at such lesions is not known: it has been suggested that Mfd may promote mutagenesis by increasing the efficiency with which RNA polymerase bypasses non-bulky lesions, but it has also been reported that 8-oxoguanine, a major product of oxidative DNA damage that is efficiently bypassed by RNA polymerase, is subject to Mfd-dependent transcription-coupled repair in Escherichia coli. The transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene) is a widely conserved bacterial protein that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair. Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA. The bacterial Mfd protein is a transcription-repair coupling factor that performs two key functions during transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. Transcription and DNA repair are coupled in E. coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins. The first is to remove RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes that have been stalled by a DNA lesion from the site of damage, and the second is to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins. Coupling of transcription and DNA repair in bacteria is mediated by transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF, the product of the mfd gene), which removes transcription elongation complexes stalled at DNA lesions and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the site. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors Mfd may act through a translocase activity that rewinds upstream DNA, leading either to translocation or to release of RNA polymerase when the enzyme active site cannot continue elongation. Recent structural studies of the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, have revealed a modular architecture in which an ATP-dependent DNA-based motor is coupled to protein-protein interaction domains that can attach the motor to RNA polymerase and the DNA repair protein UvrA E. coli Transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation. We also find that the transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd, promotes direct restart of the fork following the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP We also found that the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd promotes direct restart of the fork after the collision by facilitating displacement of the RNAP We show that Mfd-dependent TCR in bacteria involves the formation of a damage search complex that can detect lesions downstream of a stalled RNAP, and that the strand specificity of the accelerated repair pathway is independent of the requirement for a lesion to stall RNAP coli by the Mfd protein, which dissociates transcription elongation complexes blocked at nonpairing lesions and mediates recruitment of DNA repair proteins	[['Mfd'], ['NusA']]

Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine as continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusions and the possibility of a bolus injection is suited for children aged 6 years. In neuropathic pain or phantom pain coanalgetics should be used to effectively treat pain in young patients. Pregabalin is one of the first drugs registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It is also indicated as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of epilepsy and for generalized anxiety disorder. Pregabalin is a GABA analogue Treatment was typically initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, and 5 of the 6 girls noted improvement in their symptoms, including 2 who had marked improvement, and another 3 with substantial improvement who were able to discontinue therapy without a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Vulvodynia does occur among young girls and, when treated as a neuropathic pain disorder, was found to dramatically improve or remit in the majority of those treated in this small case series. We describe a case series of five adolescents who were managed with lidocaine 5% patches for chronic localized neuropathic pain from a variety of causes with minimal adverse effects. Treatment was effective in four of five patients with only one patient complaining of minimal pain relief Twenty-two children or 14% of children on opioid therapy underwent 30 opioid rotations. Mucositis was the cause of pain in 19 (70%) children, bone pain in 3 (11%) children, and postoperative, visceral, or neuropathic pain in the remainder. The opioid was rotated either for excessive side effects with adequate analgesia (70%), excessive side effects with inadequate analgesia (16.7%), or tolerance (6.7%). Five (23%) children required two rotations, 3 during the same admission. The favored rotations were morphine to fentanyl in 20 (67%) children and fentanyl to hydromorphone in 6 (20%). Adverse opioid effects were resolved in 90% of cases, all failures occurred when morphine was rotated to fentanyl. To test the hypothesis that children with terminal cancer and neuropathic pain require rapid increases of opioids and benzodiazepines immediately before death, we compared drug usage in the last 72 hours of life in children with and without neuropathic pain Dying children with cancer and neuropathic pain have higher baseline requirements of morphine and benzodiazepines and require rapid increases of both drugs in the last 72 hours of life than dying children without neuropathic pain. ketamine treatment may be effective in children with severe neuropathic pain not responsive to other analgesics. This patient also demonstrates the feasibility of long-term ketamine treatment in pediatric oncology and that such treatment can be administered in a home care setting. Oral amitriptyline has been used as an analgesic in a wide range of pain settings. Despite long-term availability of a parenteral form, the few reports about this formulation have been limited to pharmacokinetic studies in normal volunteers, trials in depressed patients, and analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) activation. We retrospectively reviewed our experience using intravenous (IV) amitriptyline at Children's Hospital, Boston and at Children's Hospital at Stanford. Eight children (aged 5-16.6 years), who were unable to tolerate medications by the oral route, received IV amitriptyline for a variety of indications, including neuropathic pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and as an adjuvant agent for opioid analgesia.

The iodothyronine deiodinases D1, D2, and D3 enable tissue-specific adaptation of thyroid hormone levels in response to various conditions, such as hypothyroidism or fasting. The possible expression of D2 mRNA in skeletal muscle is intriguing because this enzyme could play a role in systemic as well as local T3 production Human skeletal muscle D2 mRNA expression is modulated by fasting and insulin, but not by hypothyroidism. SM had very low D2 activity and again no differences were found between groups; D3 activity in SM was higher in NTIS than controls Deiodinase activities were then assayed in cell sonicates.

5148885ad24251bc05000032	Which genes are involved in patient response to warfarin?	We identified ORM1 as another polymorphic gene affecting warfarin dose requirements. ORM1 *S carriers require lower maintenance doses to achieve and maintain an optimal level of anticoagulation. Detecting genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 could guide clinical use of warfarin to reduce the risk of adverse reactions including bleeding in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy The genes encoding for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) are the major genetic determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant contributions of these genes to warfarin dose requirements. The CYP2C9 gene has also been associated with bleeding risk with warfarin. The CYP4F2 gene influences vitamin K availability and makes minor contributions to warfarin dose requirements There are other genetic polymorphisms that may further explain the response to warfarin. The VKORC1 genotype is an important determinant of response to warfarin in Chinese, but some genetic variants found in other ethnic groups that have a large effect on warfarin response and dosing are not commonly found in Chinese the alleles rs1799853 (*2) and rs1057910 (*3) of the CYP2C9 gene, as well as rs9923231 of the VKORC1 gene were associated with warfarin dose required to achieve anticoagulation with INR of 2-3. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) are known to contribute to variability in sensitivity to coumarins. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms are important factors that influence warfarin dose response in Sudanese patients he response to the anticoagulant drug warfarin is greatly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance for genotyping the VKORC1 -1639G>A SNP and two SNPs (430C>T and 1075A>C) for the CYP2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3), all of which are relevant in warfarin pharmacogenentics. Genetic variability in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes is associated with increased warfarin sensitivity CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms known to affect warfarin response genetic variants of VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and EPHX1 were found to be significant predictor variables for the maintenance dose of warfarin, explaining 26.6% of dose variability. CYP2C9 was the most important gene determining initial anticoagulant control, whereas VKORC1 was more important for stable anticoagulation. Novel associations with some clinical outcomes were found with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytochrome 450 genes CYP2C18 and CYP2C19, which were independent of the associations observed with CYP2C9 and in genes encoding CYP3A5, protein S and clotting factor V, although the variability explained by these genes was small. VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, body weight, age, and serum albumin were found to affect the inter-individual variabilit the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes have been demonstrated to be determinants of warfarin response. On the basis of these observations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a labeling change for warfarin that includes the genetic information of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as factors influencing interindividual variability in warfarin dosing. T the two key genes of interest, the cytochrome P450 2C9 gene, CYP2C9, and the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 gene, VKORC1, on warfarin response The influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes on warfarin dose requirements has been consistently demonstrated in diverse racial and ethnic patient groups in observational studies and randomized clinical trials. genetic factors influencing drug pharmacokinetics (CYP2C9) and pharmacodynamic response (VKORC1). In particular, the discovery of polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene that strongly impact oral anticoagulant dose has heightened expectations that genetic testing Our data suggest that CYP2C9 genotype, age and body size are important determinants of warfarin dose requirements in African-Americans. Our data further suggest that the VKORC1 G6853C polymorphism alone may not be useful for predicting warfarin dose requirements in this racial group. A strong association was found between genetic polymorphisms in six genes, including VKORC1, CYP2C9, PROC, EPHX1, GGCX, and ORM1, and interindividual variability in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the strongest predictors were VKORC1 and CYP2C9. Three of six VKORC1 SNPs were found to be very strongly associated with the average warfarin dose required to achieve the target international normalised ratio (INR; p<0.0001) These results are of considerable clinical interest and confirm recently published results regarding the role of these two genes in modifying warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage. The consistent findings regarding the role of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 in warfarin metabolism and maintenance dosage represent a clinically useful proof of principal for the use of pharmacogenomic information in medicine and may lead to improved understanding of warfarin's actions. Clinical studies showed an increased plasma level of S-warfarin, decreased clearance of S-warfarin, increased frequency of bleeding, and prolongation of hospitalization in patients with variant CYP2C9 alleles.

52bf1f4503868f1b06000016	For the treatment of which conditions can atypical neuroleptic drugs be used?	Further clinical implications are described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations). Intervention strategies are a multimodal psychological programme for the intervention in early prodromal stages and a combination of psychotherapy with atypical neuroleptic drugs in the late prodromal stages.  Atypical neuroleptic drugs have enriched our treatment programs, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. Reviewed here is the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder.  o prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated. The handwriting of 18 schizophrenic patients before and during treatment with typical (haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate) and atypical (clozapine, risperidone) neuroleptic drugs was examined. Atypical and typical neuroleptics, when administered chronically, can bring about profound but contrasting changes in schizophrenic symptoms and motor activation and dramatically modulate brain neurochemistry Recent studies suggest that clozapine is more effective than typical neuroleptics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Acute and late onset movement disorders frequently complicate the treatment of psychosis with typical neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol, but not with atypical neuroleptic drugs like clozapine.  Only the group of boys presented other comorbidities such as negativism and conduct disorders; approximately 25% of them required treatment with atypical neuroleptic drugs. Atypical neuroleptic drugs are the preferred treatment for symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behaviour. Monotherapeutic treatment with new atypical neuroleptic drugs had a more positive effect on the mental health related quality of life (MCS) in comparison to treatment with polypharmacological treatment but not with oral conventional antipsychotics.

52eeddfcc8da898910000010	Which are the characteristics of  Andersen syndrome?	Mutations of KCNJ2, the gene encoding the human inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1, cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a disease exhibiting ventricular arrhythmia, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic features. Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis or Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes the distinct clinical features of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and facial and skeletal dysmorphisms and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance.  The patient was a 19-year-old woman with familial periodic paralysis, abnormal QT-U complex, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare inherited disorder, characterised by periodic paralysis, cardiac dysarrhythmias, and dysmorphic features, and is caused by mutations in the gene KCNJ2, which encodes the inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1. Evaluation of candidate loci culminated in the identification of a heterozygous missense mutation (R67W) in KCNJ2, the gene encoding the inward-rectifying potassium current, Kir2.1, in 41 members of a kindred in which ventricular arrhythmias (13 of 16 female members [81%]) and periodic paralysis (10 of 25 male members [40%]) segregated as autosomal dominant traits with sex-specific variable expressivity. Some mutation carriers exhibited dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, small mandible, syndactyly, clinodactyly, cleft palate, and scoliosis, which, together with cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis, have been termed "Andersen syndrome."

56f56a8609dd18d46b00000b	Mutations in which gene and which protein are associated with Netherton syndrome?	NS is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene and to the consequent lack of expression of its encoded protein LEKTI in the skin and all stratified epithelial tissues. Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, life-threatening ichthyosiform syndrome caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 gene encoding lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), a serine protease inhibitor expressed in the most differentiated epidermal layers and crucial for skin barrier function. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a debilitating congenital skin disorder caused by mutations in the SPINK5 gene encoding the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI). Loss-of-function mutations in the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor, LEKTI, encoded by the SPINK5 gene cause the rare autosomal recessive skin disease Netherton syndrome (NS). SPINK5 and Netherton syndrome: novel mutations, demonstration of missing LEKTI, and differential expression of transglutaminases. Netherton's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) protein. We observed microstructural changes and detected LEKTI activity and SPINK5 gene mutation in three Chinese patients with Netherton's syndrome.

Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome. Here we describe the intron-exon organization of the gene and characterize the SPINK5 mutations in patients from 21 families of different geographic origin, using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. Mutation of the SPINK5 gene has been identified as disease-causing in Netherton syndrome, but the pathophysiology still remains unclear. Almost all SPINK5 mutations result in the absence of the serine-protease inhibitor LEKTI protein in both keratinocytes and lymphocytes. Several skin diseases and atopic disorders including Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis have been associated with mutations and deviations of expression of SPINK5, the gene encoding the human 15-domain serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI.

54fb6fb5d176fff445000004	Which proteins participate in the formation of the Notch transcriptional activation complex?	The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding factor CSL and a transcriptional co-activator of the Mastermind family (MAML). The "RAM" region of NICD recruits Notch to CSL, facilitating the binding of MAML at the interface between the ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain of NICD and CSL. Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression. Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled. Canonical Notch signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces proteolytic release of the intracellular part of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane. ICN then travels into the nucleus where it drives the assembly of a transcriptional activation complex containing the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL, ICN, and a specialized co-activator of the Mastermind family. A consensus DNA binding site motif for the CSL protein was previously defined using selection-based methods, but whether subsequent association of Notch and Mastermind-like proteins affects the DNA binding preferences of CSL has not previously been examined. We report here the crystal structure of a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing the ankyrin domain of human Notch1 (ANK), the transcription factor CSL on cognate DNA, and a polypeptide from the coactivator Mastermind-like-1 (MAML-1).  Ligand binding by Notch receptors triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages that liberate the intracellular portion of Notch (ICN) from the cell membrane, permitting it to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex. On the basis of our results, we present a working structural model for the organization of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex. The requirement for cooperative assembly of the MAML1.ICN.CSL.DNA complex suggests that a primary function of ICN is to render CSL competent for MAML loading. We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis. Mastermind (Mam) is a component of Notch pathway signaling. In combination with the intracellular domain of Notch and Suppressor of Hairless, Mam forms a transcriptional activation complex. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA. This function relies on the formation of transcriptional activation complexes that include intracellular Notch, a Mastermind co-activator and the transcription factor CSL bound to cognate DNA High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member NotchIC, together with the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind, form a ternary complex with CSL that activates transcription from genes that are responsive to Notch signaling Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression Nuclear ICN binds to a highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factor called CSL (also known as RBP-Jkappa, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag-1) and recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional co-activators to form a transcriptional activation complex	[['Notch intracellular domain (NICD)', 'NICD', 'Intracellular part of Notch', 'ICN', 'NIC'], ['Transcription factor CSL', 'RBP-Jkappa', 'CBF1', 'Suppressor of Hairless', 'Lag-1'], ['The coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1', 'MAML-1']]
532c0c21d6d3ac6a3400001b	Which are the main methods for pharmacophore modelling?	protein interactions are becoming increasingly significant as potential drug targets; however, the rational identification of small molecule inhibitors of such interactions remains a challenge. Pharmacophore modelling is a popular tool for virtual screening of compound libraries, and has previously been successfully applied to the discovery of enzymatic inhibitors. However, the application of pharmacophore modelling in the field of protein:protein interaction inhibitors has historically been considered more of a challenge and remains limited. In this review, we explore the interaction mimicry by known inhibitors that originate from in vitro screening, demonstrating the validity of pharmacophore mapping in the generation of queries for virtual screening. We discuss the pharmacophore mapping methods that have been successfully employed in the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors.   a popular tool for virtual screening of libraries to identify novel active substances that can be potentially developed into drugs. While they have been applied for years on common drug targets, their application in the discovery of protein-protein interaction inhibitors remains limited. This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions. We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes. This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures. We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets. The best HypoGen pharmacophore model for ACC2 inhibitors (Hypo1_ACC2) consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic aliphatic and one hydrophobic aromatic feature, whereas the best pharmacophore (Hypo1_ACC1) for ACC1 consists of one additional hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) features. The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by various methods such as test set, decoy set and Cat-Scramble methodology. The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen several small-molecule databases, including Specs, NCI, ChemDiv and Natural product databases to identify the potential dual ACC inhibitors. The virtual hits were then subjected to several filters such as estimated [Formula: see text] value, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis. pharmacophore model has been developed using diverse classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors useful in the treatment of human tumours. Among the top 10 generated hypotheses, the second hypothesis, with one hydrogen bond acceptor, one ring aromatic and three hydrophobic features, was found to be the best on the basis of Cat Scramble validation as well as test set prediction (r(training) = 0.89, r(test) = 0.82). The model also maps well to the external test set molecules as well as clinically active molecules and corroborates the docking studies. Finally, 10 hits were identified as potential leads after virtual screening of ZINC database for EGFR TK inhibition.  In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the known Aurora-A inhibitors as well as identify new lead compounds against Aurora-A, 3D pharmacophore models were developed based on the known inhibitors.  computational methods for molecular design are well established in medicinal chemistry research, their application in the field of natural products is still not exhaustively explored. This article gives a short introduction into both the potential for the application of computer-assisted approaches, such as pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, docking, and neural networking to efficiently access the bioactive metabolites, and the requirements and limitations related to this specific field. The challenge is which selection criteria and/or multiple filtering tools to apply for a target-oriented isolation of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites. Application examples are provided where in silico tools and classical methods used by natural product scientists are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery.  pharmacophore models derived from protein binding site atoms without the inclusion of any ligand information have become more popular in virtual screening studies. However, the accuracy of protein-based pharmacophore models for reproducing the critical protein-ligand interactions has never been explicitly assessed.  Our results demonstrate that there are significant variations in the success of protein-based pharmacophore models to reproduce native contacts and consequently native ligand poses dependent on the details of the pharmacophore generation process. We show that the generation of optimized protein-based pharmacophore models is a promising approach for ligand pose prediction and pose rankings pharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target shared by a group of compounds. Pharmacophores also represent the spatial arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket. Structure based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure. The SBP methods that derive pharmacophore from protein-ligand complexes use the potential interactions observed between ligand and protein, whereas, the SBP method that aims to derive pharmacophore from ligand free protein, uses only protein active site information 3D pharmacophore methods are now commonly used as part of more complex workflows in drug discovery campaigns, and have been successfully and extensively applied in virtual screening (VS) approaches.

517539af8ed59a060a000026	Which genes are regulated by MEF-2 in the heart?	Inhibition of MEF2A using siRNA attenuated HB-EGF-induced COX-2, ANF expression and cell size. This genetic reprogramming coincides with a pronounced increase in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha gene, which we show to be a direct MEF2 target gene cardiac calsequestrin gene (casq2) Functional studies demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sites significantly decreased the transcription of the gene in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, indicating that they are important to drive cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription of the casq2 gene. DTEF-1 also interacts with MEF- 2 by coimmunoprecipitation and independently or cooperatively (with MEF-2) trans-activates the cTnT promoter An 85-bp region within the enhancer is highly conserved between human and mouse and contains a central AT-rich site, which is essential for enhancer activity. This site binds myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 factors, principally MEF2D and MEF2A in cardiocyte nuclear extracts. These results are discussed in the context of MEF2 activity and of the regulation of the alpha-cardiac actin locus.

Upstream from position -1.5 kb, there is no significant homology among the SERCA2 genes cloned. The cardiac calsequestrin gene consists of 11 exons and its 5' flanking region is characterized by the presence of a TATA-like box, muscle specific promoter elements such as 7 E-boxes, 1 MEF-2, 1 MCBF and 1 Repeat (musS) motifs, as well as several muscle non-specific transcriptional elements (AP-2A, NRE1, NRE2, p53, Spel and TFI-IIA). our laboratory identified a 28 bp HF-la/MEF-2 element in the MLC-2v promoter region, which confers cardiac ventricular chamber-specific gene expression during murine cardiogenesis, In this study, we investigated T3R alpha 1-vs. T3R beta 1-specific interactions with the myocyte enhancer-specific factor-2 (MEF-2) on the expression of the SERCA 2 gene in transient transfection assays in embryonal heart-derived H9c2 cells. point to T3R isoform-specific interactions with a cell type-specific transcription factor (MEF-2) in the regulation of SERCA 2 gene expression. In multiple independent transgenic mouse lines, we found that both a 250 base pair myosin light chain-2 ventricular promoter fragment, as well as a dimerized 28 bp sub-element (HF-1) containing binding sites for HF1a and HF1b/MEF2 factors, directed ventricular-specific reporter expression from as early as the endogenous gene, at day 7.5-8.0 post coitum. Myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) regulates alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene expression in vitro and in vivo In the MLC-2 gene, an AT-rich element (HF-1b) which contains a consensus MEF-2 site is required for cardiac tissue-specific expression. Role of myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) in transcriptional regulation of the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene. In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the muscle-specific subunit of the human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) gene, chimeric genes composed of the upstream region of the PGAM-M gene These observations define the PGAM-M enhancer as the only cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific enhancer characterized thus far that is mainly activated through MEF-2. Transcription of each gene is independently controlled but coordinately regulated. During each embryogenesis, the beta-MHC gene is expressed as part of the cardiac myogenic program under the control of NKX-2.5, MEF-2C, and GATA-4/5/6. We have characterized the specific DNA regulatory elements responsible for the function of the human cardiac troponin C gene (cTnC) muscle-specific enhancer in myogenic cells. We used functional transient transfection assays with deletional and site-specific mutagenesis to evaluate the role of the conserved sequence elements. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated the ability of the functional sites to interact with nuclear proteins. We demonstrate that three distinct transcription activator binding sites commonly found in muscle-specific enhancers (a MEF-2 site, a MEF-3 site, and at least four redundant E-box sites) all contribute to full enhancer activity but a CArG box does not.

52d2818403868f1b06000033	Which are the newly identified DNA nucleases that can be used to treat thalassemia?	Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) DNA editing technology enables site-directed engineering of the genome We used this opportunity to evaluate the effect of total donor homology on transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) mediated bi-allelic modification.  Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. In this study, we used zinc finger nuclease-mediated knockout of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) in MCF7 and AHR knockout in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to investigate cross talk among AHR, ARNT, and estrogen receptor α (ERα).  For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA.  Genome editing using engineered nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) has become a powerful technology for reverse genetics Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free β-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We report here the correction of α-thalassemia major hydrops fetalis in transgene-free iPS cells using zinc finger-mediated insertion of a globin transgene in the AAVS1 site on human chromosome 19.   Here, we review the development of Cas9 as an important tool to not only edit the genomes of a number of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, but also as an efficient system for site-specific transcriptional repression or activation. Additionally, a specific Cas9 protein has been observed to target an RNA substrate, suggesting that Cas9 may have the ability to be programmed to target RNA as well. RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms.  The CRISPR/Cas technology has been successfully used to stimulate the integration of small DNA sequences in a target locus to produce gene mutations.

In addition to identifying caspases-4 and -5 as potential targets for limiting intestinal inflammation, this study has identified epithelial-expressed caspases-4 and -5 as biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential in CRC. However, the involvement of two related inflammatory caspase members, caspases-4 and -5, during intestinal homeostasis and disease has not yet been established. This study demonstrates that caspases-4 and -5 are involved in IBD-associated intestinal inflammation. Altered activity of caspases, particularly caspase-1, has been implicated in the development of intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) In contrast, engagement of various PRR in the recently identified inflammasome complexes lead to activation of a cysteine protease, caspase-1.  ctivation of inflammatory caspase proteases.

We conclude that ILK does not play a prominent role in the promotion or sustenance of established MM. Defective granulation tissue formation in mice with specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in fibroblasts Here, we show that fibroblast-restricted inactivation of ILK in mice leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts, whereas inflammatory infiltrate and vascularization of the granulation tissue are unaffected. in fibroblasts, ILK is crucial for limiting RhoA activity, thus promoting TGFβ1 production, which is essential for dermal repair following injury. Our results show that ILK is important for the function, but not the differentiation, of osteoclasts. Osteoclast-specific inactivation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) inhibits bone resorption. ack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB. Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration. Enhanced liver regeneration following changes induced by hepatocyte-specific genetic ablation of integrin-linked kinase. ILK deficiency caused an aberrant distribution of nephrin and alpha-actinin-4 in podocytes, whereas the localization of podocin and synaptopodin remained relatively intact. Targeted ablation of ILK from the murine heart results in dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous heart failure. Here we show that targeted ablation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression results in spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by 6 wk of age. Together, these results suggest that ILK plays a central role in protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure. Our results show for the first time in vivo the significance of ILK and hepatic ECM-signaling for regulation of hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation.

DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II of plant origin transcribes viroid RNA into full-length copies DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II purified from healthy plant tissue is capable of synthesizing linear (-)-viroid RNA copies of full length from (+)-viroid RNA templates in vitro. Viroid RNA is accepted as a template for in vitro transcription by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli The RNA genome of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) is transcribed in vitro into complementary DNA and RNA by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase, respectively, from Escherichia coli. In vitro transcription of viroid RNA into full-length copies by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato leaf tissue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from healthy tomato plant tissue accepts potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) RNA as a template for the in vitro synthesis of full-length RNA copies of the PSTV genome Whereas maximum total activity was observed in 1 mM Mn(2+) with a pronounced reduction (80%) in 5 mM Mn(2+), CEV synthesis was maintained in 1-15 mM Mn(2+). Inhibition of alpha-amanitin-sensitive CEV synthesis in 200 mM (NH(4))(2)SO(4) resembles the reaction of RNA polymerase II on a free nucleic acid template Citrus exocortis viroid RNA is associated with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II in tomato in vivo. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV. Transcription of potato spindle tuber viroid by RNA polymerase II starts predominantly at two specific sites Pospiviroidae, with their main representative potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), are replicated via a rolling circle mechanism by the host-encoded DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (pol II) Transcription of potato spindle tuber viroid by RNA polymerase II starts in the left terminal loop Viroids of the family Pospiviroidae, of which potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is the type strain, are replicated by the host's DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II in the nucleus. Tomato RNA polymerase II interacts with the rod-like conformation of the left terminal domain of the potato spindle tuber viroid positive RNA genome Host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) was proposed to be critical for its replication, but no interaction site for RNAP II on the PSTVd RNA genome was identified.  RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined. Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined Viroids of the family Pospiviroidae, of which potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is the type strain, are replicated by the host&apos;s DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II in the nucleus Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II.  These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved.  Inhibition studies with alpha-amanitin showed that the synthesis of ASBV-specific RNAs was not affected by concentrations of 1 and 200 micrograms/ml of the drug, which typically inhibit RNA polymerase II and III, respectively, from most animal and plant systems. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved. Nucleoprotein complexes in the soluble fraction which bound to a monoclonal antibody to the carboxy terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (8WG16) were affinity purified and contained plus- and minus-sense CEV RNA. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV.

54f431d664850a5854000006	Which are the genes responsible for Dyskeratosis Congenita?	Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2) Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome with seven disease-causing genes identified to date, six of which are linked to telomere maintenance. Mutations in one of these genes (TINF2), which encodes a component of the shelterin complex, are associated with particularly short telomeres Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inheritable bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation, dystrophic nails and oral leukoplakia Four genes, namely DKC1 (codes for dyskerin), TERC and TERT (code for telomerase) and NOP10, have been implicated in the pathogenesis To date, CTC1, DKC1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, NHP2, NOP10, and WRAP53 are the genes in which mutations are known to cause DC and result in very short telomeres The mode of inheritance of DC varies by gene: DKC1 (X-linked), TERC and TINF2 (autosomal dominant), TERT (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive), CTC1, WRAP53, NHP2, and NOP10 (autosomal recessive) Six genes have been identified, defects in which cause different genetic subtypes (X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive) of DC. The products of these genes encode components that are critical for telomere maintenance; either because they are core constituents of telomerase (dyskerin, TERC, TERT, NOP10 and NHP2) or are part of the shelterin complex that protects the telomeric end (TIN2) BACKGROUND: Telomerase complex genes mutations (DKC1, TERC, TERT, and NOP10) lead to premature telomere shortening and are responsible for different forms of dyskeratosis congenita.

52bf1af803868f1b06000008	Which diseases are caused by mutations in Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene?	Recessively inherited CPVT is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene. It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia.  The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene. In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p.L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT.  These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease. Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT. Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease. We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT. Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p.Y55C (c.164A>G) and p.P308L (c.923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene.  A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT. Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations.  We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles.  The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias. Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT.  Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.  These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT. This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT. An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM). A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance. Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter). A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu). These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population.

51bdf045047fa84d1d000003	Which are the Atg8 homologs in human?	Strikingly, in addition to ULK1 and ULK2, ATG13 and FIP200 interacted with human ATG8 proteins, all with strong preference for the GABARAP subfamily. GABARAPL1 belongs to the small family of GABARAP proteins (including GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2/GATE-16), one of the two subfamilies of the yeast Atg8 orthologue. Identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1 Stbd1 has been reported to interact with a known autophagy protein, GABARAPL1, a member of the Atg8 family. Atg8 is a yeast protein involved in the autophagic process and in particular in the elongation of autophagosomes. In mammals, several orthologs have been identified and are classed into two subfamilies: the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, referred to simply as the LC3 or GABARAP families. GABARAPL1 (GABARAP-like protein 1), one of the proteins belonging to the GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein) family The proteins that make up the GABARAP family demonstrate conservation of their amino acid sequences and protein structures. In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16). The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes. ATG3 is the E2-like enzyme necessary for ATG8/LC3 lipidation during autophagy. Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming autophagic membranes, have been identified. At least eight different Atg8 orthologs belonging to two subfamilies (LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP) occur in mammalian cells, but their individual roles and modes of action are largely unknown. truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1) Structure of GATE-16, membrane transport modulator and mammalian ortholog of autophagocytosis factor Aut7p. The yeast ortholog of GATE-16 is the autophagocytosis factor Aut7p. GATE-16 is also closely related to the GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified.

530db83b38c1322806000002	Which proteins cause cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kB?	Sef is an inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine signaling, acting by cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-κB According to the classical model, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm of resting cells via binding to inhibitory, IκB proteins and translocates into the nucleus upon their ligand-induced degradation. Like IκBs, Sef sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm of resting cells. The activity of NF-κB is tightly controlled through its cytoplasmic sequestration by specific inhibitors, IκBs. The inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) family of proteins is believed to regulate NF-kappaB activity by cytoplasmic sequestration. IkappaBalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters NF-kappaB dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. p105.Ikappa Bgamma and prototypical Ikappa Bs use a similar mechanism to bind but a different mechanism to regulate the subcellular localization of NF-kappa B We show that the death domain of p105 (also of IkappaBgamma) is essential for the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-kappaB by p105 and IkappaBgamma. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappaB transcription factors are retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. The ability of the IkappaB alpha protein to sequester dimeric NF-kappaB/Rel proteins in the cytoplasm provides an effective mechanism for regulating the potent transcriptional activation properties of NF-kappaB/Rel family members. The presence of a discrete nuclear import sequence in IkappaB alpha suggests that cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-kappaB/Rel-IkappaB alpha complex is a consequence of the mutual masking of the NLS within NF-kappaB/Rel proteins and the import sequence within IkappaB alpha. The viral Tax protein, which is encoded by human T-cell leukaemia virus HTLV-I, activates nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors and relieves cytoplasmic sequestration of RelA and Rel by heterodimerization with NF-kappa B1/p1O5 (refs 1,2). The I-kappa B protein, which is necessary for the cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-kappa B transcription factor complex, was identified specifically in regions of limbic, hypothalamic, and autonomic nuclei.

530cf22aa177c6630c000005	List the components of a Replisome Progression Complex (RPC).	This interaction requires the RPC components Mrc1 and Ctf4, both of which associate with a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain located at the amino terminus of Dia2 Here we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks We found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components Here, we show that the RPC associates with DNA polymerase alpha that primes each Okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha Others have found recently that the Mrc1 subunit of RPCs binds DNA polymerase epsilon, which synthesises the leading strand at DNA replication forks we show that the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex allows the MCM (minichromosome maintenance) helicase to interact with key regulatory proteins in large replisome progression complexes (RPCs) that are assembled during initiation and disassembled at the end of S phase RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion. RPCs also interact with Mcm10 and topoisomerase I During initiation, GINS is essential for a specific subset of RPC proteins to interact with MCM. GINS is also important for the normal progression of DNA replication forks, and we show that it is required after initiation to maintain the association between MCM and Cdc45 within RPCs We found previously that many regulatory proteins assemble around the MCM2-7 helicase at yeast replication forks to form the replisome progression complex (RPC), which might link MCM2-7 to other replisome components. Here we show that SCF(Dia2) associates with the replisome progression complex (RPC) that assembles around the MCM2-7 helicase at DNA replication forks [6]. Compared with wild type, hydroxyurea-treated ctf18жд cells exhibited increased chromatin association of replisome progression complex components including Cdc45, Ctf4, and GINS complex subunits, the polymerase processivity clamp PCNA and the single-stranded DNA-binding complex RPA. The amino-terminal TPR domain of Dia2 tethers SCF(Dia2) to the replisome progression complex. Ctf4 is a protein conserved in eukaryotes and a constituent of the replisome progression complex. Eukaryotic GINS also links with other key proteins at the fork to maintain an active replisome progression complex. Dia2 has previously been implicated in the control of replication and genome stability via its interaction with the replisome progression complex. The Cdc45-MCM-GINS complex could constitute the core of a larger macromolecular structure that has been termed the "replisome progression complex". FACT does not associate with the Mcm2-7 helicase at replication origins during G1 phase but is subsequently incorporated into the replisome progression complex independently of histone binding and uniquely among histone chaperones. Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha. Replisome progression complex links DNA replication to sister chromatid cohesion in Xenopus egg extracts. On the basis of the physical interactions between AND-1 and DNA polymerases, we discuss a model to describe how replisome progression complex establishes sister chromatid cohesion. The components of the replisome that preserve genomic stability by controlling the progression of eukaryotic DNA replication forks are poorly understood. RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion.

56cf2be73975bb303a000005	What do mepolizumab and reslizumab have in common?	The most promising agents are targeted against cytokines of Th2 pattern and related receptors, such as IL-2 (daclizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab) or IL-5 in patients with hypereosinophilia (mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab). Patients with severe asthma or COPD have often a suboptimal symptom control due to inadequate treatment.  For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events. Safety data for reslizumab, another anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, and benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody to the IL-5 receptor α-chain, are comparatively limited, especially for benralizumab, although reports of administration of these antibodies to humans suggest that they are well tolerated. IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8). In patients with severe, refractory asthma associated with eosinophilia, however, clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in asthma exacerbations. Clinical studies in other disorders, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome, have also shown significant improvements in blood and/or tissue eosinophilia and variable alterations in clinical disease activity. Strategies aimed at the inhibition of IL-5 may hold great promise in the treatment of eosinophilic diseases. Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). Both antibodies have demonstrated the ability to reduce blood and tissue eosinophil counts.  Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). To date, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been developed that bind to human IL-5. Monoclonal antibodies directed towards interleukin-5, such as mepolizumab or reslizumab, were shown to be very effective at reducing blood and airways eosinophilia.

5713bc991174fb1755000010	Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?	 GJB1 is currently considered to be associated with X-linked DI-CMT, and MPZ, INF2, DNM2, YARS, GNB4, NEFL, and MFN2 are associated with autosomal DI-CMT. Moreover, GDAP1, KARS, and PLEKHG5 are associated with RI-CMT. Identification of these genes is not only important for patients and families but also provides new information about pathogenesis A novel mutation in LRSAM1 causes axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with dominant inheritance Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) refers to a heterogeneous group of genetic motor and sensory neuropathies. According to the primary site of damage, a distinction is made between demyelinating and axonal forms (CMT1 and 2, respectively, when inherited as an autosomal dominant trait). Leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing protein 1 (LRSAM1) is a ubiquitin-protein ligase with a role in sorting internalised cell-surface receptor proteins. So far, mutations in the LRSAM1 gene have been shown to cause axonal CMT in three different families and can confer either dominant or recessive transmission of the disease We have identified a novel mutation in LRSAM1 in a small family with dominant axonal CMT Phenotypical features of the p.R120W mutation in the GDAP1 gene causing autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A) or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K). Most of these mutations present a recessive inheritance, but few autosomal dominant GDAP1 mutations have also been reported  Our findings highlight the relevance of dominantly transmitted p.R120W GDAP1 gene mutations which can cause an axonal CMT with a wide clinical profile A novel GDAP1 Q218E mutation in autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease There have been very few reports of GDAP1 mutations in autosomal dominant (AD) CMT Here, we report an AD CMT family with a novel Q218E mutation in the GDAP1 gene CMT type 1 (CMT1; MIM 118200) is a group of autosomal dominant-inherited demyelinating neuropathies with a disease onset at or after childhood. Five different subtypes have been identified based on different causative genes. Among them, CMT1A (MIM #118220) is most common and is usually associated with a duplication of a 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2, which includes peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22; MIM *601097) Mutations in the NF-L gene (NEFL) cause autosomal dominant neuropathies that are classified either as axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 2E (CMT2E) or demyelinating CMT type 1F (CMT1F) Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, LITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI and a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also cause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria) Mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin 2 cause dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2 to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia, Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families Here, we report a large family showing characteristic phenotypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A along with deafness in an autosomal dominant fashion. We detected a sequence variation (c.68C>G) co-segregating with the disease phenotype and leading to a T23R missense mutation in PMP22 The authors recently mapped an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT type 1 (CMT1C) to chromosome 16p13.1-p12.3 The authors identified missense mutations (G112S, T115N, W116G) in the LITAFgene (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor) in three CMT1C pedigrees We identified a novel neurofilament-light missense mutation (C64T) that causes the disease in a large Slovenian CMT2 family. This novel mutation shows complete co-segregation with the dominantly inherited CMT2 phenotype in our family Phenotypical features of the p.R120W mutation in the GDAP1 gene causing autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). A novel GDAP1 Q218E mutation in autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. A novel LRSAM1 mutation is associated with autosomal dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B. Mutations in the Dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or autosomal dominant (AD) Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease Mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene cause either autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4A or autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with vocal cord paresis A novel mutation in the GDAP1 gene is associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in an Amish family Phenotypical features of a Moroccan family with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease associated with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1 gene Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22.  OBJECTIVE: Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT).  Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A) or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K).  Mutations in the NEFL gene were recently reported as a cause for autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E) linked to chromosome 8p21.  Mild functional differences of dynamin 2 mutations associated to centronuclear myopathy and Charcot-Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy. Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination.  Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated with neutropaenia or cataracts.  .

54fb4b34d176fff445000001	Which transcription factors (TFs) participate in the formation of the interferon-beta (IFN-b) enhanceosome?	The dimer formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun transcription factors is one of the main components of the human interferon-beta enhanceosome. The induction of IFN transcription resulted from the activation of the components of the IFN-beta enhanceosome, i.e. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun. Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene. Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3).  Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB. Transcriptional activation of the virus inducible enhancer of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, IRFs and the architectural protein of the mammalian high mobility group I(Y) [HMG I(Y)]. Here, we demonstrate that the first step in enhanceosome assembly, i.e. HMG I(Y)-dependent recruitment of NF-kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun to the enhancer, is facilitated by discrete regions of HMG I and is mediated by allosteric changes induced in the DNA by HMG I(Y) and not by protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and these proteins. However, we show that completion of the enhanceosome assembly process requires protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and the activators. Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP.  The transcriptional coactivators CBP and P/CAF are required for activation of transcription from the IFN beta enhanceosome. We show that CBP and P/CAF acetylate HMG I(Y), the essential architectural component required for enhanceosome assembly, at distinct lysine residues, causing distinct effects on transcription. The transcriptional activity of an in vitro assembled human interferon-beta gene enhanceosome is highly synergistic. This synergy requires five distinct transcriptional activator proteins (ATF2/c-JUN, interferon regulatory factor 1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB), the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y), and the correct alignment of protein-binding sites on the face of the DNA double helix. In addition, we provide evidence that recruitment of the holoenzyme by the enhanceosome is due, at least in part, to interactions between the enhanceosome and the transcriptional coactivator CREB, cAMP responsive element binding protein (CBP).  Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y). Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators. A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on the DNA helix. We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex (enhanceosome). This multicomponent complex includes at least three distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y). Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome. Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y)	[['NF-kappa B (p50/p65)'], ['ATF-2'], ['c-jun'], ['IRF-3'], ['IRF-7'], ['IRF-1']]
56a39a32496b62f23f000005	List packages for transcription factor binding sites' (TFBS) analysis available in R/Bioconductor	Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations. Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals. It is thus of great interest to distinguish TFs that directly regulate gene expression from those that are indirectly associated with gene expression. Graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, provide a powerful mathematical framework to infer different types of dependencies. However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small. Here, we develop a novel computational method, the Neighbourhood Consistent PC (NCPC) algorithms, which deal with these scenarios much more effectively than existing methods do. We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables. NCPC and DDGraph can also be applied to other problems involving highly correlated biological features. Both methods are implemented in the R package ddgraph, available as part of Bioconductor Here, we present MMDiff, a robust, broadly applicable method for detecting differences between sequence count data sets. Based on quantifying shape changes in signal profiles, it overcomes challenges imposed by the highly structured nature of the data and the paucity of replicates Supervised detection of conserved motifs in DNA sequences with cosmo We here introduce an algorithm, called cosmo, that allows this search to be supervised by specifying a set of constraints that the position weight matrix of the unknown motif must satisfy. Such constraints may be formulated, for example, on the basis of prior knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor in question. The algorithm is based on the same two-component multinomial mixture model used by MEME, with stronger reliance, however, on the likelihood principle instead of more ad-hoc criteria like the E-value dPattern: transcription factor binding site (TFBS) discovery in human genome using a discriminative pattern analysis.

515de993298dcd4e51000024	List all reported treatment options for anxiety in autism spectrum disorder.	A parent report of comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or anxiety was associated with a high rate of use, with 80% receiving ≥ 1 psychotropic medication Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of a modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD. the present study is the first controlled trial to demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS. This pilot, randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skills Intervention (MASSI) program in a sample of 30 adolescents with ASD and anxiety symptoms of moderate or greater severity. These findings suggest MASSI is a feasible treatment program and further evaluation is warranted. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). the Coping Cat program (cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD. The intent of this article is to explore the efficacy of both the literal and concrete externalization aspects within narrative therapy, and the implementation of interactive metaphors as a combined psychotherapeutic approach for decreasing anxiety with people who present with high-functioning autism. This paper reports a case series of children and adolescents with ASD and an anxiety disorder who were treated with a standard cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) rationale adapted to take account of the neuropsychological features of ASD. children with moderate autistic symptomology (per SRS-P) were significantly more likely to improve from family CBT (FCBT) than individual CBT (ICBT; OR = 8.67) Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT. A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression. The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences. The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low. A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA) was evaluated. Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder.

Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were collected. HSP60, HSP70, antibodies to HSP60 and HSP70, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured in serum. Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis. Of the 311 women, 30.9 % (96/311) were diagnosed with MetS. These women were, on average, obese with abdominal fat deposition and had lower HDL values as well as higher triglycerides and glucose levels. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) test values in these women were compatible with insulin resistance (P < 0.05). CRP and   is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several alence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries. This disorder is not only associated with a higher risk of appearance of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, but impacts on the liver in different ways. Nonalc bolic syndrome (MS) components, such as dyslipidemia, prothrombotic status, and increased blood pressure, are risk factors for patients with renal disease. Visceral fat mass is closely related to the MS and atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of body compositions and MS on anemia parameters and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Body composition (body mass index and bioimpedance analysis) and laboratory data were obtained from 110 dialysis patients. The MS was identified according to ATP-III criteria. Anemia parameters, hemoglobin (Hgb), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone levels, and rHuEPO requirements over the last 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with the MS seem to reach target Hgb levels more frequently (10-12 g/dL; 66.3% vs 84.8%; P = .03) without any difference in total intravenous iron therapy dosage. MS patients also required lower rHuEPO for reaching similar Hgb levels compared with patients without MS (2679.3 ± 1936.1 vs 3702.5 ± 2213.0 U/kg/6 mo; P = .02). There we bolic syndrome (MetS) is typically diagnosed based on abnormalities in specific clustered clinical measures that are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current MetS criteria result in racial/ethnic discrepancies. Our goals were to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to delineate differential contributions to MetS by sub-group, and if contributions were discovered, develop sex and racial/ethnic-specific equations to calculate MetS severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data on adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010, we performed a CFA of a single MetS factor that allowed differential loadings across groups, resulting in a sex and race/ethnicity-specific continuous MetS severity score. RESULTS: Loadings to the single MetS factor differed by sub-group for each MetS component (p<0.001), with lower factor loadings among non-Hispanic-blacks for triglycerides and among Hispanics for waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure exhibited low factor loadings among all groups. MetS severity scores were correlated with biomarkers of future disease (high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, uric acid, insulin resistance). Non-Hispanic-black-males with diabetics had a low prevalence of MetS but high MetS severity scores that were not significantly different from other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis among adults uniquely demonstrated differences between sexes and racial/ethnic groups regarding contributions of traditional MetS components to an assumed single factor. The resulting equations provide a clinically-accessible and interpretable continuous measure of MetS for potential use in identifying adults at higher risk for MetS-related diseases and following changes within individuals over time.

56a37e33496b62f23f000003	List types of avoided words in bacterial genomes	Avoidance of palindromic words in bacterial and archaeal genomes: a close connection with restriction enzymes. Short palindromic sequences (4, 5 and 6 bp palindromes) are avoided at a statistically significant level in the genomes of several bacteria, including the completely sequenced Haemophilus influenzae and Synechocystis sp. genomes and in the complete genome of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii. Palindromes corresponding to sites for restriction enzymes from other species are also avoided, albeit less significantly, suggesting that in the course of evolution bacterial DNA has been exposed to a wide spectrum of restriction enzymes, probably as the result of lateral transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids and prophages Palindromic words appear to accumulate in DNA once it becomes isolated from restriction-modification systems, as demonstrated by the case of organellar genomes In certain cases, a comparison of avoided palindromic words in taxonomically related bacteria shows a pattern of relatedness of their R-M systems. Recognition sites for type II restriction and modification enzymes in genomes of several bacteria are recognized as semi-palindromic motifs and are avoided at a significant degree. On the basis of the set of most avoided words, and in accordance to the IUPAC coding standards, suggestions are made regarding potential recognition sequences. In certain cases, a comparison of avoided palindromic words in taxonomically related bacteria shows a pattern of relatedness of their R-M systems.

5518414a15fa47643f000001	Which gene(s) should be genotyped in order to prescribe the drug Cetuximab (anti-EGFR)?	Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with targeted anti-EGFR therapeutics such as cetuximab extends survival in only 25% of patients who test wild-type for KRAS, while the majority of patients prove resistant (J Clin Oncol 28(7):1254-1261, 2010). . Somatic mutation of the EGFR signalling pathway is a prevalent mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (Nature 486(7404):532-536, 2012). If the human genome harbours variants that influence susceptibility of the EGFR pathway to oncogenic mutation, such variants could also be prognostic for cetuximab responsiveness.  KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab.  KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab. KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies. The EGFR-R497K polymorphism is a potential predictor for overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab based therapy in the palliative setting. Laboratories are increasingly required to perform molecular tests for the detection of mutations in the KRAS gene in metastatic colorectal cancers to allow better clinical management and more effective treatment for these patients. KRAS mutation status predicts a patient's likely response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. KRAS mutation has been unambiguously identified as a marker of resistance to cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.   This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status. Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. KRAS mutation is a dramatic example of single nucleotide polymorphism, which is able to identify a priori patients that could receive or not an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab.  While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy. . This study suggests that TP53 mutations are predictive of cetuximab sensitivity, particularly in patients without KRAS mutation, and that TP53 genotyping could have a clinical interest to select patients who should benefit from cetuximab-based CT. A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line.  KRAS genotyping was recently introduced as predictive biomarker, since only tumors carrying a wildtype were found to respond to treatment with panitumumab.	[['KRAS'], ['EGFR'], ['BRAF'], ['T53']]

This study provides the first description of increased expression of miRNA miR-155 and miR-146a in RA In this study we investigated the expression, regulation, and function of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and RA synovial tissue The objective of this study was to identify the expression pattern of microRNA-146 (miR-146) in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) This study shows that miR-146 is expressed in RA synovial tissue and that its expression is induced by stimulation with TNFalpha and IL-1beta pregulated miR-146a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy and disease control individuals, and the expression of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, miR-16, and microRNA let-7a was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR Rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited between 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold increases in miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, and miR-16 expression, whereas let-7a expression was not significantly different compared with healthy control individuals Our data also suggest a possible mechanism contributing to rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, whereby miR-146a expression is increased but unable to properly function, leading to prolonged tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in patients with rheumatoid arthritis Repression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK-1 in THP-1 cells resulted in up to an 86% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, implicating that normal miR-146a function is critical for the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production icroRNA-124a is a key regulator of proliferation and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 secretion in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis We found that miR-124a levels significantly decreased in RA synoviocytes as compared with OA synoviocytes Induction of miR-124a in RA synoviocytes significantly suppressed the production of the CDK-2 and MCP-1 proteins he results of this study suggest that miR-124a is a key miRNA in the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of RA synoviocytes iR-223 is overexpressed in T-lymphocytes of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Although a multifactorial pathogenesis has been hypothesized, the precise mechanisms leading to the disease are still poorly understood at the molecular level. miRNA expression profile analysis highlighted that miR-223 is the only miRNA that is strikingly deregulated in peripheral T-lymphocytes from RA patients compared with healthy donors In summary, our data provide a first characterization of the miRNA expression profiles of peripheral T-lymphocytes of RA patients, identifying miR-223 as overexpressed in CD4(+) naive T-lymphocytes from these individuals Altered microRNA expression profile with miR-146a upregulation in CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis The role of miR-146a overexpression in regulating T cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry We have detected increased miR-146a in CD4+ T cells of RA patients and its close correlation with TNF-alpha levels. Our findings that miR-146a overexpression suppresses T cell apoptosis indicate a role of miR-146a in RA pathogenesis and provide potential novel therapeutic targets icroRNA-146a expresses in interleukin-17 producing T cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients Six miRNAs, let-7a, miR-26, miR-146a/b, miR-150, and miR-155 were significantly up regulated in the IL-17 producing T cells These

(MMP) expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) The current results demonstrate methylation-dependent regulation of miR-203 expression in RASFs  Importantly, they also show that elevated levels of miR-203 lead to increased secretion of MMP-1 and IL-6 via the NF-κB pathway and thereby contribute to the activated phenotype of synovial fibroblasts in RA iR-124a as a key regulator of proliferation

tristetraprolin stabilization Using a microarray, we found two miRNAs, miR-125b and miR-939 predicted to target the 3'-UTR of TNF-α mRNA, to be up-regulated in RA FLS in response to LPS, but their repression did not restore mature TNF-α expression in FLS We showed previously that miR-346, which is upregulated in LPS-activated FLS, inhibited Btk expression that stabilized TNF-α mRNA Different

chronic inflammation in the joint through a positive feedback loop in NF-κB signaling, with concomitant up-regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes and mediators of inflammation in RASFs As inflammation

52f112bb2059c6d71c000002	Which are the enzymes involved in the addition of 7-methylguanosine in mRNA?	In mammals, cap synthesis is catalysed by the sequential action of RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5'-phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), enzymes recruited to RNA pol II (polymerase II) during the early stages of transcription. We recently discovered that the mammalian cap methyltransferase is a heterodimer consisting of RNMT and the RNMT-activating subunit RAM (RNMT-activating mini-protein). RAM activates and stabilizes RNMT and thus is critical for cellular cap methylation and cell viability. Synthesis of the methyl cap initiates with the addition of 7-methylguanosine to the initiating nucleotide of RNA pol II (polymerase II) transcripts, which occurs predominantly during transcription and in mammals is catalysed by RNGTT (RNA guanylyltransferase and 5' phosphatase) and RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase). The RNMT-activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein), is also recruited to transcription initiation sites via an interaction with RNMT. Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript. Myc induces methyl cap formation by promoting RNA polymerase II phosphorylation which recruits the capping enzymes to RNA, and by up-regulating the enzyme SAHH (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase), which neutralizes the inhibitory by-product of methylation reactions. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). The guanylyltransferase (GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.50) reaction responsible for cap formation usually proceeds via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The methylation of the 5' terminal guanosine residue of the cap structure of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mRNAs has been shown to occur in vitro concomitantly with their synthesis (R. K. Cross and P. J. Gomatos, Virology, 114, 542-554, 1981). The enzyme responsible for this methylation, a guanine-7-methyltransferase, is associated with the SFV replication complex An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells.

5358e067f1005d6b5800000b	Which proteins are involved in actin bundling and filopodia formation and function?	CRP1, a protein localized in filopodia of growth cones, is involved in dendritic growth CRP1, which cross-links actin filaments to make actin bundles, is the only CRP family member expressed in the CNS with little known about its function in nerve cells. Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of CRP1 expression by short hairpin RNA interference results in inhibition of filopodia formation and dendritic growth in neurons. Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity. F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. In this study, we investigated the role of fascin, a cytoskeleton actin-bundling protein involved in the formation of filopodia and cell migration, in prostate cancer progression. In cellular models, fascin gene silencing using small interfering RNA in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145 decreased cell motility and invasiveness while increasing cell adhesive properties. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that induces membrane protrusions and cell motility after the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia. The PCH family member MAYP/PSTPIP2 directly regulates F-actin bundling and enhances filopodia formation and motility in macrophages Overexpression of MAYP decreased CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and increased filopodia formation, motility and CSF-1-mediated chemotaxis. The opposite phenotype was observed with reduced expression of MAYP, indicating that MAYP is a negative regulator of CSF-1-induced membrane ruffling and positively regulates formation of filopodia and directional migration. Overexpression of MAYP led to a reduction in total macrophage F-actin content but was associated with increased actin bundling. Consistent with this, purified MAYP bundled F-actin and regulated its turnover in vitro. In addition, MAYP colocalized with cortical and filopodial F-actin in vivo. Because filopodia are postulated to increase directional motility by acting as environmental sensors, the MAYP-stimulated increase in directional movement may be at least partly explained by enhancement of filopodia formation. We report an unexpected direct association between fascin, an actin-bundling component of filopodia, microspikes and lamellipodial ribs, and protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), a regulator of focal adhesions. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. Actin-crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells. IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo. Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo. Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8. Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions. The bundling activity of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein is required for filopodium formation Filopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia. Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments. Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Role of the actin bundling protein fascin in growth cone morphogenesis: localization in filopodia and lamellipodia Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia. Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons. Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles. Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones. Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles.

56bdfa73ef6e394741000003	List symptoms of Hakim Triad.	Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures. Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies.  INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá, Colombia.

Feathers and hair consist of cornified epidermal keratinocytes in which proteins are crosslinked via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of structural proteins to establish mechanical resilience.  The method involves the generation of thiols by controlled reduction of cystine disulfide bonds in keratin ossible chemical bonds formed between alpha-keratins and KAbetaPs may derive from electrostatic interactions in addition to cross-linking through disulphide bonds. The method involves the generation of thiols by controlled reduction of cystine disulfide bonds in the keratin e solubility test in the dithiothreitol/urea extraction buffer, the amino acid composition analysis and studies on keratin secondary structures suggest that the improved stability in water of thermally treated mats can be ascribed to the formation of amide bonds between acid and basic groups of some amino acid side chains. s the energy involved in the formation of disulfide bonds is much greater than that of hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions the structural transition is likely to be dominated by the requirement that the bonded cysteine residues occur at closely equivalent axial positions. The interface of the K5-K14 coiled-coil heterodimer has asymmetric salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, and its surface exhibits a notable charge polarization. A trans-dimer homotypic disulfide bond involving Cys367 in K14's stutter region occurs in the crystal and in skin keratinocytes, where it is concentrated in a keratin filament cage enveloping the nucleus.   the alpha helices which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and the alpha-helical coiled coils which are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, is more sensitive to radiation than the supramolecular architecture of the keratin filament and the filament packing within the keratin associated proteins matrix, which is stabilized by disulphide bonds. . A good solvent attacks the disulfide bonds between cystine molecules and hydrates the hair shaft.	[['cystine disulfide bonds'], ['amide bonds'], ['hydrogen bonds']]
54c90dabf693c3b16b000004	Which genes have been proposed as potential candidates for gene therapy of heart failure?	The molecular abnormalities underlying HF are discussed along with potential targets for gene therapy, focusing on SERCA2a. The aim of this study was to improve cardiac function in chronic HF by overexpressing constitutively active inhibitor-1 (I-1c)  In summary, I-1c overexpression using BNP116 improves cardiac function in a clinically relevant model of ischemic HF. therapeutic activation of YAP or its downstream targets, potentially through AAV-mediated gene therapy, may be a strategy to improve outcome after MI calcium up-regulation by AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy is safe and of potential benefit in advanced heart failure patients.  Survivin gene therapy can attenuate the progression of LV systolic dysfunction in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Heart failure-inducible molecular targeting of PP1β has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for heart failure. The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a), along with the start of more recent phase 1 trials, opens a new era for gene therapy for the treatment of heart failure. Our results present a strong rationale for a clinical trial of S100A1 gene therapy for human heart failure that could potentially complement current strategies to treat end-stage heart failure. S100A1, a positive inotropic regulator of myocardial contractility, becomes depleted in failing cardiomyocytes in humans and animals, and myocardial-targeted S100A1 gene transfer rescues cardiac contractile function by restoring sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca(2+)) handling in acutely and chronically failing hearts in small animal models. Use of gene therapy for heart failure is gaining momentum as a result of the recent successful completion of phase II of the Calcium Upregulation by Percutaneous Administration of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease (CUPID) trial, which showed clinical safety and efficacy of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a). The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the cardiac sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump (SERCA2a) has the potential to open a new era for gene therapy for heart failure. The recent successful and safe completion of a phase 2 trial targeting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a) has the potential to open a new era for gene therapy in the treatment of heart failure. AIMS: Impaired myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) activity is a hallmark of failing hearts, and SERCA2a gene therapy improves cardiac function in animals and patients with heart failure (HF).

52f8995b2059c6d71c00004a	Which genes have been found to be associated with restless leg syndrome	We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS).  The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin.  A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.  In the German sample, variants in MEIS1 and BTBD9 were associated with RLS in ESRD (P(nom)≤0.004, ORs 1.52 and 1.55), whereas, in the Greek sample, there was a trend for association to MAP2K5/SKOR1 and BTBD9  This is the first demonstration of a genetic influence on RLS in ESRD patients with BTBD9 being significantly associated. Four family members developed dopa-responsive dystonia, with onset in their late teens, and subsequently developed restless leg syndrome and migraine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an intragenic guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 duplication in a dopa-responsive dystonia family. To date, no gene mutation has been found, but five gene loci have been mapped in primary RLS to chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, and 20p (RLS1 through 5) We demonstrate linkage to a locus on chromosome 9p that is probably distinct from RLS3. Our family with a rather homogeneous phenotype and very early disease onset represents a unique opportunity to further elucidate the genetic causes of the frequent restless leg syndrome.

52bf1dea03868f1b06000012	What are the side effects of Nalmefene?	Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. Side effects to nalmefene were of greater duration and intensity in the subjects receiving 10 mg of nalmefene vs. those receiving 6 or 2 mg. These included most notably fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting. The nalmefene treated group ate 22% less, both in terms of absolute weight and caloric intake, of a standardised buffet-meal than did the placebo group.  Thus the apparent nutrient specificity of nalmefene appeared to be an indirect consequence of its effect on palatability. Nalmefene also caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for observed changes in eating behaviour. In the second study, six healthy men were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours. A dosing schedule of 20 mg q12h was then started and continued for seven days. Plasma samples were collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose. The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day administration period.  In the first study, single ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg of nalmefene HCl were administered in double-blind fashion to four groups of healthy men. There were six subjects in each group; four received nalmefene and two received placebo. The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, such as lightheadedness, at the higher doses.  Doses of nalmefene as large as 0.4 mg/kg, IV, produced only minor side effects. These side effects included some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and mild sedation. Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden. Sedation wore off during the course of prolonged infusions.  The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness.

530cf4d5e2bfff940c000004	Which are the most common methods for gene prioritization analysis?	We developed a new network inference algorithm called the Knowledge Network Gene Prioritization (KNGP) algorithm which can incorporate both link and node knowledge  In recent years, network-based methods - which utilize a knowledge network derived from biological knowledge - have been utilized for gene prioritization We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour, to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these phenomena  We intend to use the ensemble boosting learning techniques to combine variant computational approaches for gene prioritization in order to improve the overall performance. The experimental results show that our ensemble learning approach outperforms the four gene-prioritization methods in ToppGene suite in the ranking results of the 13 known genes in terms of mean average precision, ROC and AUC measures The proposed enhanced RaJoLink rare-term model combines text mining and gene prioritization approaches.  Computational gene prioritization is based on various pieces of correlative evidence that associate each gene with the given disease and suggest possible causal links Recently, many network-based methods have been proposed that implicitly utilize the modularity principle, which states that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to form physical or functional modules in gene/protein relationship networks the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach, but the modularity principle has not been fully considered in traditional RWR approaches Therefore, we propose a novel method called ORIENT (neighbor-favoring weight reinforcement) to improve the performance of RWR through proper intensification of the weights of interactions close to the known disease genes Network-based methods have been successfully exploiting this concept by capturing the interaction of genes or proteins into a score  Over the last years, computational approaches exploiting interaction network topology have been successfully applied to prioritize individual genes involved in diseases. Here, we propose a genome-wide network-based prioritization framework named GUILD The traditional approach to reduce the number of candidate genes entails fine-mapping studies using markers and pedigrees For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification.  hus, comparing the similarity between experimentally identified phenotypes and the phenotypes associated with human diseases can be used to suggest causal genes underlying a disease. In this manuscript, we present a method for disease gene prioritization based on comparing phenotypes of mouse models with those of human diseases. We present biomarker identification problem using gene prioritization method called gene prioritization from microarray data based on shortest paths, extended with structural and biological properties and edge flux using voting scheme (GP-MIDAS-VXEF). ensemble approach to microarray data-based gene prioritization after missing value imputation Recently, we have introduced the data mining tool ENDEAVOUR (Aerts et al., 2006), which performs this task automatically by relying on different genome-wide data sources, such as Gene Ontology, literature, microarray, sequence and more So far, biologists have relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine such an ordering We study the effect of different data integration methods, and based on the validation studies, we show that our approach, ToppGene http://toppgene.cchmc.org, outperforms two of the existing candidate gene prioritization methods, SUSPECTS and ENDEAVOU  Extending on an earlier hypothesis that the majority of genes that impact or cause disease share membership in any of several functional relationships we, for the first time, show the utility of mouse phenotype data in human disease gene prioritization We use co-expression data from yeast (S. cerevisiae), nematode worm (C. elegans), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), mouse and human and find that the use of evolutionary conservation can indeed improve the predictive value of co-expression Using a training set of genes known to be involved in a biological process of interest, our approach consists of (i) inferring several models (based on various genomic data sources), (ii) applying each model to the candidate genes to rank those candidates against the profile of the known genes and (iii) merging the several rankings into a global ranking of the candidate genes vocabularies, representations and ranking algorithms for gene prioritization by text mining Recently, text mining techniques have been applied to extract prior knowledge from text-based genomic information sources and this knowledge can be used to improve the prioritization process We present an approach to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms for further follow-up in genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes The proposed method combines both the use of open data access from two type 2 diabetes-genome-wide association studies (granted by the Diabetes Genetics Initiative and the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium) and the comprehensive analysis of candidate regions generated by the freely accessible ENDEAVOUR software. ToppGene Suite (http://toppgene.cchmc.org; this web site is free and open to all users and does not require a login to access) is a one-stop portal for (i) gene list functional enrichment, (ii) candidate gene prioritization using either functional annotations or network analysis and (iii) identification and prioritization of novel disease candidate genes in the interactome.

51656c94298dcd4e51000058	What is the inheritance pattern of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy? 	. Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait. Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance. The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers. compatible with X-linked inheritance form The first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD. As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus. contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD. The STA gene encodes emerin and is one of the genes that is affected in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Although it has been reported that EDMD caused by the STA gene mutation is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance, the genotype-phenotype correlations, with special reference to cardiac manifestations, are not well defined. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a muscular disorder characterized by 1) early contracture of the elbows. Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles, 2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a humeroperoneal distribution, and 3) life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction block. Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy. The patient had no familial background of the disease. This patient might have a sporadic inheritance pattern with severe cardiac involvement. autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is characterized by the clinical triad of early onset contractures of elbows, Achilles tendons and spine, wasting and weakness with a predominantly humero-peroneal distribution and life-threatening cardiac conduction defects and/or cardiomyopathy. Two main types of inheritance have been described: the X-linked form is caused by mutations in the STA gene on locus Xq28 and the gene for the autosomal dominant form (LMNA gene) has been localized on chromosome 1q11-q23. Recently, mutations in this LMNA gene have been also found to be responsible for the less frequent autosomal recessive form of the disease. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by early contractures of elbows and Achilles tendons, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and a cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks which is life-threatening. Two modes of inheritance exist, X-linked (OMIM 310300) and autosomal dominant (EDMD-AD; OMIM 181350). EDMD-AD is clinically identical to the X-linked forms of the disease. Mutations in EMD, the gene encoding emerin, are responsible for the X-linked form. including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD, this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance. Seventeen families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) have been studied both by DNA sequencing and by emerin protein expression. Fourteen had mutations in the X-linked emerin gene, while three showed evidence of autosomal inheritance. Twelve of the 14 emerin mutations caused early termination of translation. One family presented a rare autosomal dominant variant of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another with X-linked recessive inheritance showed unusual intrafamilial variability. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is characterised by (1) early contractures of the Achilles tendons, elbows, and postcervical muscles, (2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a predominantly humeroperoneal distribution in the early stages, and (3) cardiomyopathy with conduction defects and risk of sudden death. Inheritance is usually X linked recessive but can be autosomal dominant. Tendon contractures may be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women. Since the disease was diagnosed in 3 brothers, the X-coupled recessive type of its inheritance is assumed. An opinion is advanced that the described form is a clinical variety of Emery-Dreyfus myodystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS) the term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with proximal weakness in both the upper and lower limbs and X-linked scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy represent the same disorder. There is at least one other report of autosomal dominant transmission of this clinical picture, which had previously only been reported as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with X-linked recessive inheritance.

Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities, respectively. Selective ablation of TRalpha2 resulted in an inevitable, concomitant overexpression of TRalpha1.

HMMpTM: improving transmembrane protein topology prediction using phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence. Our method integrates a novel feature in transmembrane protein topology prediction, which results in improved performance for topology prediction and reliable prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. The method is freely available at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/HMMpTM MetaTM - a consensus method for transmembrane protein topology prediction. A novel TM consensus method, named MetaTM, is proposed in this work. MetaTM is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six TM topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. On a large data set comprising 1460 sequences of TM proteins with known topologies and 2362 globular protein sequences it correctly predicts 86.7% of all topologies. CONCLUSION: Combining several TM predictors in a consensus prediction framework improves overall accuracy compared to any of the individual methods. Our proposed SVM-based system also has higher accuracy than a previous consensus predictor. MetaTM is made available both as downloadable source code and as DAS server at http://MetaTM.sbc.su.se We present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. We present the results of applying these tools to a number of complete genomes. Source code, data sets and a web server are freely available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/ Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to the tasks of transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction. In this paper we expand upon this work by making use of the more powerful class of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). Our model, Philius, is inspired by a previously published HMM, Phobius, and combines a signal peptide submodel with a transmembrane submodel. We introduce a two-stage DBN decoder that combines the power of posterior decoding with the grammar constraints of Viterbi-style decoding. Philius also provides protein type, segment, and topology confidence metrics to aid in the interpretation of the predictions We report a relative improvement of 13% over Phobius in full-topology prediction accuracy on transmembrane proteins, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 in detecting signal peptides HMM_RA: an improved method for alpha-helical transmembrane protein topology prediction This paper presents a Hidden Markov Model (referred to as HMM_RA) that can predict the topology of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins with improved performance. HMM_RA adopts the same structure as the HMMTOP method, which has five modules: inside loop, inside helix tail, membrane helix, outside helix tail and outside loop. Each module consists of one or multiple states A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins The algorithms presented here, are easily implemented in any kind of a Hidden Markov Model, whereas the prediction method (HMM-TM) is freely available for academic users TMHMM, the current state-of-the-art method, has less than 52% accuracy in topology prediction on one set of transmembrane proteins of known topology. Based on the observation that there are functional domains that occur preferentially internal or external to the membrane, we have extended the model of TMHMM to incorporate functional domains, using a probabilistic approach originally developed for computational gene finding. Our extension is better than TMHMM in predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins. As prediction of functional domain improves, our system's prediction accuracy will likely improve as well Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions HMMpTM: improving transmembrane protein topology prediction using phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction.

56b739d976d8bf8d13000005	List available genetic multicolor cell labeling techiniques in Drosophila	Flybow: genetic multicolor cell labeling for neural circuit analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. To facilitate studies of neural network architecture and formation, we generated three Drosophila melanogaster variants of the mouse Brainbow-2 system, called Flybow. Sequences encoding different membrane-tethered fluorescent proteins were arranged in pairs within cassettes flanked by recombination sites. Flybow combines the Gal4-upstream activating sequence binary system to regulate transgene expression and an inducible modified Flp-FRT system to drive inversions and excisions of cassettes. This provides spatial and temporal control over the stochastic expression of one of two or four reporters within one sample. Using the visual system, the embryonic nervous system and the wing imaginal disc, we show that Flybow in conjunction with specific Gal4 drivers can be used to visualize cell morphology with high resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this labeling approach is compatible with available Flp-FRT-based techniques, such as mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker; this could further support the genetic analysis of neural circuit assembly and function. Drosophila Brainbow: a recombinase-based fluorescence labeling technique to subdivide neural expression patterns. We developed a multicolor neuron labeling technique in Drosophila melanogaster that combines the power to specifically target different neural populations with the label diversity provided by stochastic color choice. This adaptation of vertebrate Brainbow uses recombination to select one of three epitope-tagged proteins detectable by immunofluorescence. Two copies of this construct yield six bright, separable colors. We used Drosophila Brainbow to study the innervation patterns of multiple antennal lobe projection neuron lineages in the same preparation and to observe the relative trajectories of individual aminergic neurons. Nerve bundles, and even individual neurites hundreds of micrometers long, can be followed with definitive color labeling. We traced motor neurons in the subesophageal ganglion and correlated them to neuromuscular junctions to identify their specific proboscis muscle targets. The ability to independently visualize multiple lineage or neuron projections in the same preparation greatly advances the goal of mapping how neurons connect into circuits. Brainbow: new resources and emerging biological applications for multicolor genetic labeling and analysis.	[['Flybow'], ['Drosophila Brainbow']]
56c703445795f9a73e00000a	Which histone modification discriminates between active and poised enhancers?	Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancer Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers. We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury. However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury. Recent studies using mammalian cells showed that a chromatin state signature is associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and strong depletion of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3 Such permissive binding was largely restricted to open-chromatin regions showing histone modification marks characteristic of active enhancer and promoter regions, whereas open-chromatin regions lacking such marks did not show permissive binding.  We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone The bivalent hypothesis posits that genes encoding developmental regulators required for early lineage decisions are poised in stem/progenitor cells by the balance between a repressor histone modification (H3K27me3), mediated by the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), and an activator modification (H3K4me3) Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.  Furthermore, we compare the ability of eRNAs and H3K27ac to discriminate enhancer activity. We demonstrate that eRNA is more indicative of enhancer activity.	[['H3K4me1'], ['H3K27ac']]
56c344abfedd0b786b000003	What are the properties of super-enhancers?	Here we report that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified by global nuclear run-on sequencing are extensively transcribed within super enhancers and are dynamically regulated in response to cellular signaling. Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers. The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization.  Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation. Here we review evidence for super-enhancer involvement in cancers, complex diseases, and developmental disorders and discuss interactions between super-enhancers and cofactors/chromatin regulators. The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification. Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers (SEs) drive expression of genes that play prominent roles in normal and disease cells, but the functional importance of these clustered enhancer elements is poorly understood, so it is not clear why genes key to cell identity have evolved regulation by such elements Super-enhancers thus provide a platform for signaling pathways to regulate genes that control cell identity during development and tumorigenesis. Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin. We report here that the ESC master transcription factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation Super-enhancers thus play key roles in the control of mammalian cell identity. Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity. We describe here the population of transcription factors, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and transcription apparatus occupying super-enhancers in embryonic stem cells and evidence that super-enhancers are highly transcribed.  Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation. Inflammation-sensitive super enhancers form domains of coordinately regulated enhancer RNAs. NF-κB directs dynamic super enhancer formation in inflammation and atherogenesis. Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.

534bb147aeec6fbd07000014	Which are the cardiac effects of thyronamines?	Most recently, thyroid hormone derivatives were identified, the thyronamines which are decarboxylated thyroid hormones initiating physiological actions like lowering body temperature and heart rate, thereby acting in opposite direction to the classical thyroid hormones. Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass.  Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac output (IC(50)=109 microM, 159 microM, and 242 microM, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC(50)=94 microM and 27 microM, respectively.  A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action.  In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart rate.

55086ea1098a1b487b000001	Matuzumab has been tested for treatment of which cancers?	 Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been studied in phase II trials. A phase I pharmacokinetic study of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This phase I study investigated the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Matuzumab combined with paclitaxel was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC.  This article focuses on anti-Her-2 therapy, specifically trastuzumab, as well as other epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists such as cetuximab, panitumub, matuzumab, nimotzumab, gefitinib, and erlotinib. Phase I study of matuzumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in patients with advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two different weekly doses of the fully humanized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with high-dose 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and cisplatin (PLF) in the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-positive advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been evaluated in phase II trials.  Pemetrexed with or without matuzumab as second-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: This randomized phase II study investigated pemetrexed in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab compared with pemetrexed alone as second-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  Matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) compared with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer: a randomised, multicentre open-label phase II study. BACKGROUND: Clinical data showed promising antitumour activity with feasible tolerability for matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) chemotherapy in untreated advanced oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer.   CONCLUSION: Matuzumab 800 mg weekly combined with ECX chemotherapy does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced OG cancer. In all studies, the patients had different types of advanced carcinoma - mainly colon, rectal and pancreatic cancer. They received matuzumab as multiple 1-hour intravenous infusions in a wide range of dosing regimens (development dataset: from 400 mg every 3 weeks to 2000 mg in the first week followed by 1600 mg weekly; evaluation dataset: from 100 mg weekly to 800 mg weekly).   Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, and ch806, are in different stages of development for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Molecular determinants of response to matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have proven to be effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that express EGFR. We recently published a phase I study of weekly matuzumab plus paclitaxel. Our data suggest that EGFR expression and KRAS mutation status is predictive for clinical response to matuzumab +/- paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. Phase I study of epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine plus matuzumab in previously untreated patients with advanced oesophagogastric cancer. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the humanised antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) in patients as first-line treatment for advanced oesophagogastric cancer that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Therefore, these first successes led to the development of several drugs including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, panitumumab, matuzumab), TK inhibitors targeting one receptor as well as TK pan-inhibitors (lapatinib, HKI 272, PKI 166, EKB-569, AEE-788), currently assessed through clinical trials worldwide. Antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor in non small cell lung cancer: current status of matuzumab and panitumumab. Matuzumab and panitumumab are antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that are being evaluated in several malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In phase I trials of single-agent matuzumab in patients with EGFR-positive cancer, three tumor responses were documented in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well as colorectal carcinoma. A phase II trial of EMD72000 (matuzumab), a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated. In this population of very heavily pretreated patients with epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies, there was no evidence of significant clinical activity when matuzumab was administered as monotherapy. Phase I study of the humanised anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody matuzumab (EMD 72000) combined with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer.  Three groups of chemotherapy-naive advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (n=17) received escalating doses of matuzumab (400 mg weekly, 800 mg biweekly, or 800 mg weekly) and gemcitabine (1000 mg m-2 weekly in weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle).  A phase I study of the humanized monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody EMD 72000 (matuzumab) in combination with paclitaxel in patients with EGFR-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase I study assessed the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the combination of matuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC. Other anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (panitunumab, matuzumab) are currently evaluated.  It is the target for a class of agents at the forefront of development for the treatment of colorectal cancer, ie, the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, which include cetuximab, panitumumab, and matuzumab.  Two other monoclonal antibodies, matuzumab (EMD 72000) and panitumumab (ABG-EGF), also have shown activity against EGFR-expressing CRC but are still in the early stage of clinical development. Matuzumab is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials for gastric, cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.

516c0ebc298dcd4e5100006e	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?	our data suggests that TRbeta1-mediated down regulation of hepatic LDLr gene may play a critical role in iodine excess-induced hypercholesterolemic effects. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. However, the T3-activated expression of the GH gene in GH3-PV and ME gene in SK-Hep-1-PV was repressed by approximately 30% and 90%, respectively, indicating the lack of correlation of PV/TRpbeta1 protein ratio with the dominant negative potency of mutant PV. Transient cotransfection of P450R promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs and the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TR beta1) expression plasmid into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells resulted in a 2.4-fold induction of promoter activity that was both T3 and TR beta1 dependent. At the molecular level, we detected a dose-dependent attenuation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) expression in parallel to the change of serum cholesterol.

5524562387ecba3764000001	Which are the different homologs or family members of the hedgehog proteins in mammals?	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals.  We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC. Previous work has shown that activin, a TGF(beta+) signaling molecule, permits pancreas development by repressing expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules that antagonize pancreas development. Here we show that Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another hedgehog family member, and Patched 1 (Ptc1), a receptor and negative regulator of hedgehog activity, are expressed in pancreatic tissue. The original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh).  Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a secreted signaling molecule of the hedgehog family known to play important roles in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, cortical bone formation, and the development of joints. Hedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH) bind to Patched family receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2) to transduce signals to GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. GLI family transcription factors then activate transcription of Hedgehog target genes, such as FOXE1 and FOXM1 encoding Forkhead-box transcription factors. Indian hedgehog (IHH) and its receptors patched (PTC) and smoothened (SMO) belong to the hedgehog family of signaling molecules, which are essential for a variety of patterning events during mammalian tIssue development. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh).

51486f7dd24251bc0500002e	Which scales are recommended by the American Heart Association for depression screening in cardiovascular patients? 	In 2008, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended a 2-step screening method, consisting of the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) followed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), for identifying depression in cardiovascular patients. The American Heart Association (AHA) statement has recommended routine screening for depression in coronary artery disease with a 2-stage implementation of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). A recent American Heart Association (AHA) Prevention Committee report recommended depression screening of all coronary heart disease patients using 2- and 9-item instruments from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) to identify patients who may need further assessment and treatment. Patients were screened for depression using a protocol identical to the one endorsed by the AHA in a cardiology community clinic in Elmhurst (Queens, New York). Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Depression screening in cardiac patients has been recommended by the American Heart Association, but the best approach remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nurse-administered versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression screening in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome.

We show that Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring (H-NS) protein can facilitate correct recognition of a promoter by RNA polymerase in AT-rich gene regulatory regions One feature is a histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into subunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin Recently the histone-like proteins were found in some primitive eucaryotes and procaryotes The relationship between HMGs (1 + 2) and the "primitive" histone-like DNA-packaging proteins from prokaryotes and mitochondria is discussed The amino acid composition of the protein resembled those of the other prokaryotic histone-like proteins and also to eukaryotic histones H2A and H2B In prokaryotes and in the pool of vegetative phage DNA the most abundant histone-like protein HU is not associated with the bulk DNA, but localised in the border region with ribosomes where transcription and translation occur Like the histones, HU is able to condense DNA in vitro and to introduce negative super-coiling in covalently closed circular, relaxed DNA molecules in the presence of topoisomerase I HU is well conserved in all prokaryotes but surprisingly, it is also homologous to another E. coli DNA-binding protein, IHF Here we describe the identification of two developmental stage-specific genes, one of which is predicted to encode a 26-kDa lysine- and alanine-rich protein that appears to be homologous to several eukaryotic histone H1 proteins No sequence homology was observed between this protein and other bacterial "histone-like" chromosomal proteins, but homology does exist with two other recently described prokaryotic proteins In this study we show that these proteins can substitute for the prokaryotic DNA-bending protein HU in promoting the assembly of the Hin invertasome, an intermediate structure in Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion We have characterized the role of HU in assembling the invertasome, an intermediate nucleoprotein complex involved in Hin-mediated site-specific recombination Using ligase-mediated circularization of short DNA fragments we also show that HU, the high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins from mammals, and

5319a724b166e2b806000025	Which trinucleotide repeat disorders are affecting the nervous system?	The discovery that expansion of unstable repeats can cause a variety of neurological disorders has changed the landscape of disease-oriented research for several forms of mental retardation, Huntington disease, inherited ataxias, and muscular dystrophy. Expansion of trinucleotide repeats is now recognized as a major cause of neurological disease. At least seven disorders result from trinucleotide repeat expansion: X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), two fragile X syndromes of mental retardation (FRAXA and FRAXE), myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Fragile X and myotonic dystrophy are multisystem disorders usually associated with large expansions of untranslated repeats, while the four neurodegenerative disorders, SBMA, Huntington's disease, SCA1, and DRPLA, are caused by smaller expansions of CAG repeats within the protein coding portion of the gene.

Prevalence and long-term outcome of epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is reported to be variable Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are benign tumors, most commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive, frequently lethal cystic lung disease that almost exclusively affects women. Rhabdomyoma is the most common type of cardiac tumor in fetuses and is often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with neurologic sequelae. In contrast to renal angiomyolipomas, which are often associated with tuberous sclerosis, clinical characteristics of subependymal nodule (SN) - subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SGCA) complex in tuberous sclerosis NMI patients had a lower incidence of brain findings on imaging studies, neurological features, and renal findings than those with TSC2 mutations. In contrast, NMI patients had a lower incidence of seizures than TSC patients with TSC1 mutations, but had a higher incidence of both renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. clinical characteristics of subjects with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, both sporadic and tuberous sclerosis-related forms. Women with tuberous sclerosis-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis were younger and had less impaired lung function compared with those with the sporadic form. Balloon cells are histopathological hallmarks of various cortical malformations, i.e., focal cortical dysplasia (Taylor's type, FCD IIb), hemimegalencephaly (HME) or cortical tubers (tuberous sclerosis, TSC).  Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare cause of recurrent pneumothorax and should be considered a differential diagnosis, especially in young women with diffuse bilateral bullous emphysema or tuberous sclerosis. The disease is characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous tumors: neurofibromas and angiofibromas, located in the skin, central nervous system, mucosas and other organs. Abnormal neural cell migration plays an important role in the neurological dysfunctions found in TS, the predominant features being mental retardation, seizures and behavioral disorders. The true prevalence of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is unknown.

54f0920f94afd61504000018	List drugs included in the DHAP-R chemotherapy regiment.	Standard treatment of transplant-eligible patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of rituximab and platinum-based chemotherapy, either ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) or dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP), with autologous transplant consolidation for those with chemosensitive disease. The intergroup Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) set the limits for this standard of treatment after first comparing 2 salvage regimens: rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) and rituximab, dexamethasone, aracytine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).  The response rate (RR) to first salvage chemotherapy was 23% (RR by regimen: dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [DHAP] 15%, etoposide, Solu-Medrol, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [ESHAP] 36%, and gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin [GDP] 45%); 25% (n = 28) of patients underwent ASCT.  PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens based on platinum and cytarabine in association with etoposide and methylprednisolone (ESHAP) or with dexamethasone (DHAP) with or without Rituximab (± R) in patients with refractory or a relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).  R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP). Because of the inability to safely administer unattenuated doses of anthracycline-based regimens, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) was used at full doses (along with rituximab for the DLBCL patient) until hepatic function normalized (1-5 cycles).  Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable).  Patients are first randomised between ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, ara-C and cisplatin), both combined with rituximab (R-ICE or R-DHAP). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The treatment of the patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) remains difficult. It was reported that DHAP regimen(cisplatin + Ara-C + dexamthsone) was an effective salvage therapy, but there was no report about it in China.

57220e400fd6f91b68000015	Which are the most common symptoms in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome?	Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder characterized by proximal limb muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased deep-tendon reflexes, and autonomic symptoms. There are 2 forms of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: one most frequently associated with small-cell lung cancer (P-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and the other that is a pure autoimmune form (NP-Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) LEMS weakness typically involves lower and upper limbs and the proximal muscles are predominantly affected. A significant proportion of patients also have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. LEMS recognition is based on clinical, electrophysiological and immunological criteria. Nearly 50-60% of patients with LEMS have an underlying tumour that, in almost all cases, is a small-cell lung cancer; In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels reduce the quantal release of acetylcholine, causing muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction. More than half of the affected patients have associated small cell lung cancer The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms.

TiSH--a robust and sensitive global phosphoproteomics strategy employing a combination of TiO2, SIMAC, and HILIC. An initial TiO(2) phosphopeptide pre-enrichment step is followed by post-fractionation using sequential elution from IMAC (SIMAC) to separate multi- and mono-phosphorylated peptides, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) of the mono-phosphorylated peptides (collectively abbreviated "TiSH"). After enrichment by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate proteins. Combining immunoprecipitation with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment, isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide fractionation by strong cation exchange chromatography combined with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment enabled quantification of more than 8000 distinct phosphorylation sites in Ppt1 wild-type versus Ppt1-deficient yeast cells By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins. Our method combines the use of strong cation exchange (SCX) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) for phosphopeptide enrichment, high-resolution MS for peptide and protein identification, and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for quantification. Phosphopeptides were isolated with high specificity through a simple derivatization procedure based on phosphoramidate chemistry.

56c3326750c68dd41600000b	Which histone modifications are correlated with transcription elongation?	 This is accompanied by reductions in the level of H3K36 trimethylation, a posttranslational histone modification associated with efficient transcriptional elongation, and the number of full-length transcripts from these genes. Also like BUR kinase and the PAF complex, the Spt5 CTR is important for histone H2B K123 monoubiquitination and histone H3 K4 and K36 trimethylation during transcription elongation. A positive feedback loop links opposing functions of P-TEFb/Cdk9 and histone H2B ubiquitylation to regulate transcript elongation in fission yeas  Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3 We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We next analyzed isolated ZNF 3' exons using stably integrated episomes. Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. Overall, our results show and suggest that multiple H4, H2A, and H3 residues contribute to and form a Set2 docking/recognition site on the nucleosomal surface so that proper Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation, histone acetylation, and transcriptional elongation can occur. Sp3 depletion correlated with increased H3K36me3 and H2Bub1, two histone modifications associated with transcription elongation Using a SIR-regulated heat shock-inducible transgene, hsp82-2001, and a natural drug-inducible subtelomeric gene, YFR057w, as models we demonstrate that substantial transcriptional induction (&gt;200-fold) can occur in the context of restricted histone loss and negligible levels of H3K4 trimethylation, H3K36 trimethylation and H3K79 dimethylation, modifications commonly linked to transcription initiation and elongation Sp3 depletion correlated with increased H3K36me3 and H2Bub1, two histone modifications associated with transcription elongation.

534df8c9aeec6fbd07000016	List diseases where protein citrullination plays an important role.	his modification has been linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Over the past decade, PADs and protein citrullination have been commonly implicated as abnormal pathological features in neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and rheumatoid arthritis.  These findings suggest that PAD2 and citrullinated proteins may play a key role in the brain pathology of prion diseases.  We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression.  recent advances have shown that the once obscure modification known as citrullination is involved in the onset and progression of inflammatory diseases and cancer. These observations may reflect a role of P. gingivalis in the protein citrullination, which is related to the pathogenesis of RA. Protein citrullination has been detected in the CNS and associated with a number of neurological diseases. Protein and peptide citrullination are important in the development of rheumatoid arthritis citrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.  Our data thus suggest that autoantibody formation in response to citrullinated vimentin directly induces bone loss, providing a link between the adaptive immune system and bone. citrullinated protein also has a negative side, because this protein's accumulation in the brain is a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease.  The aim of the present work was to study the effect of tobacco smoking on disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis patients and its relation to anti-cyclical citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullination we have reported pathological characterization of PAD2 and citrullinated proteins in scrapie-infected mice,  aberrant citrullinated proteins could play a role in pathogenesis and have value as a marker for the postmortem classification of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that abnormal protein citrullination by PAD2 has been closely associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and prion disease This study suggests that accumulated citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 may function in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and serve as potential therapeutic targets. PTMs such as citrullination due to alterations of peptidylarginine deiminase activity or generation of RA-specific epitopes, should be considered as a trigger in tolerance break. Protein citrullination is an important posttranslational modification recognized by rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific autoantibodies.  Protein citrullination, a once-obscure post-translational modification (PTM) of peptidylarginine, has recently become an area of significant interest because of its suspected role in human disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and also because of its newfound role in gene regulation. he increased levels of citrullinated CNS proteins associated with MS are also observed during the development of EAE.  Rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are examples of human diseases where protein citrullination involvement has been demonstrated citrullinated proteins may become a useful marker for human neurodegenerative diseases.

5311bf53e3eabad021000006	Which are the biotracers used for detection of Alzheimer's disease using PET?	(18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample. This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid β positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting)  is implicated in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects. High Aβ dep g biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid deposition [imaged with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose metabolism (imaged with [(18)F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural atrophy (imaged by MRI). Recently we published the initial subset of imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. We now exte Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent Aβ burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that Aβ-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE T ol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging. The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance. We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects. By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls). In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights. The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI  disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several Aβ-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied Aβ-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between Aβ-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of Aβ-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing Aβ content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition, is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE ε4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- EMCI and ε4- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than ε4- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE ε4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data als sitron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for β-amyloid (Aβ). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled Aβ ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvid™) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain. It was the  (Abeta) plaque formation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and precedes the onset of dementia. Abeta imaging should allow earlier diagnosis, but clinical application is hindered by the short decay half-life of current Abeta-specific ligands.

This inhibition correlated with the packaging of inhibitory APOBEC3 proteins into PFV virions, due to a specific PFV Gag/APOBEC3 interaction, and resulted in the G to A hypermutation of PFV reverse transcripts [Antiviral defense by APOBEC3 family proteins]. All APOBEC3 family proteins differentially inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition.

51487ef9d24251bc05000031	Which two catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors can be used for treatment of Parkinson disease?	Entacapone is a highly potent, reversible, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used as an adjunct to L-dopa in the treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Stalevo is a combination tablet comprised of levodopa, carbidopa, and the COMT inhibitor entacapone. It is available in fixed-dose combinations of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, 50/12.5/200, 75/18.75/200, 100/25/200, 125/31.25/200, 150/37.5/200 and 200/50/200 mg. Stalevo is currently approved for use in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose wearing off. Good news were marketing of ropinirole, a new non-ergot agonist, in December 2006 and entacapone, the first catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor in Japan in April 2007. Having faced these new situations, Japanese Neurological Association has started revising "the Guideline 2002 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease". Stalevo (Orion) combines levodopa, the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa and the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone in a single tablet. We investigated whether administration of the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, at doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, alters the pharmacokinetics of apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients experiencing severe motor fluctuations. The catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone is given in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off. Entacapone (Comtess/Comtan) is Orion Pharma's original proprietary catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor. Entacapone is able to slow down degradation of levodopa and improve the availability and efficacy of each levodopa dose, hence its use as a complement to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sleep attacks in Parkinson's disease induced by Entacapone, a COMT-inhibitor. We present a patient who suffered from sleep attacks after starting entacapone in addition to levodopa. Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, alters the pharmacokinetics of levodopa, leading to increase of levodopa concentration in plasma and brain. Two COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been made available as adjunctive agents to levodopa Two inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been introduced as adjuncts to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients. Tolcapone, a peripheral and central COMT inhibitor, appears to be quite effective, producing a 47% reduction in 'off' time. . Entacapone, a purely peripheral COMT inhibitor with a lower potency than tolcapone, has also proved to be effective and has not been associated with liver damage, obviating the need for testing. Here we report that a treatment of the cerebral tissue with tolcapone, a central and peripheral inhibitor of COMT, does not change the membrane responses of midbrain dopamine neurons to dopamine and levodopa. Therefore, the therapeutic action of tolcapone in Parkinson's disease, might be dependent on the reduction of COMT activity in the extracerebral tissue. Pretreatment with entacapone (OR-611), a peripheral catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor, greatly reduces the plasma 3OMFD fraction and provides an ideal situation to evaluate the contribution of the plasma 3OMFD fraction in several kinetic models of FDOPA uptake. The novel and reversible inhibitors are the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitors, Ro 40-7592 (3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone), and the monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor, Ro 19-6327 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-2-pyridine carboxamide HC1).

54c225bcf693c3b16b000002	Mutations of which genes have been associated with Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)?	Mutation in four genes – RYR2, CASQ2, TRDN, and CALM1 – is known to cause CPVT or related phenotypes of adrenergically induced life-threatening arrhythmias. The presence of other as-yet unidentified loci is postulated  some KCNJ2 mutation carriers lack the ATS triad and sometimes share the phenotype of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) In 50 Japanese probands from unrelated families who satisfied clinical criteria for CPVT, genetic testing was conducted in all exons on 3 CPVT-related genes: cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) and inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (KCNJ2) point mutations in RYR2, the gene encoding for the cardiac isoform of the RyR (RyR2), are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by the development of adrenergically-mediated ventricular tachycardia in individuals with an apparently normal heart. Recessive CPVT variants are due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene.  Recent studies have shown that CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) genes. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmogenic disorder associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) genes.

Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform. The practice of "liquid biopsy" as a diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic tool in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is an appealing approach, at least in theory, since it is noninvasive and easily repeated Here we introduce cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an economical and ultrasensitive method for quantifying ctDNA.  Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq. We envision that CAPP-Seq could be routinely applied clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies, thus facilitating personalized cancer therapy.

We were able to detect a protein fragment corresponding to the expected molecular mass (30 kDa) for type III deiodinase by means of Western blot analysis. RT-PCR as well as Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of D3 mRNA in the cerebellum. The presence of 5D (type-III) together with our previous report of 5'-deiodinase (type-I in euthyroidism and type-II in hypothyroidism) shows that the isozymes of deiodinases in the neurohypophysis are quite similar to those in the brain.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) hold great promise for providing various differentiated cell models for in vitro toxigenicity testing.  A direct comparison of BoNT detection using primary rat spinal cord cells and hiPSC-derived neurons showed equal or increased sensitivity BoNT/A intoxication studies demonstrate that the hiPSC-derived neurons reproducibly and quantitatively detect biologically active BoNT/A with high sensitivity (EC(50) ∼0.3 U).  these data suggest that neurons derived from hiPSCs provide an ideal and highly sensitive platform for BoNT potency determination, neutralizing antibody detection and for mechanistic studies.

56c33e5695c1e7cc5b000001	In which nuclear compartments is heterochromatin located?	This compartment localizes into three main regions: the peripheral heterochromatin, perinucleolar heterochromatin, and pericentromeric heterochromatin By separating cells according to transgene expression we show here that silencing appears to be associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), DNA methylation and the localization of the silenced gene to a specific nuclear compartment enriched in these modifications The cell nucleus is divided into chromosome territories and the extrachromosomal domain. The latter includes several structural and functional compartments involved in RNA processing and transport. We also describe a new apocentric nuclear compartment with a unique set of histone modifications that occurs as a zone of chromatin surrounding centromeric heterochromatin in differentiated lymphocytes.  Little is known about the mechanisms of gene targeting within the nucleus and its effect on gene expression, but most studies have concluded that genes located near the nuclear periphery are silenced by heterochromatin After TSA and NaBt treatment, the HP1 proteins were repositioned more internally in the nucleus, being closely associated with interchromatin compartments, while centromeric heterochromatin was relocated closer to the nuclear periphery Taking into account the different heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome, our data suggest that the relative abundance of Ty3/gypsy LTRrs along each chromosome arm is determined mainly by the different proportions of heterochromatin, particularly pericentric heterochromatin, relative to total arm length	[['peripheral heterochromatin'], ['perinucleolar heterochromatin'], ['pericentromeric heterochromatin']]
570921e4cf1c325851000017	In which genomic regions are Alu enriched?	There are regions such as the four homeobox gene clusters, which are nearly devoid of these repeats that contrast with repeat dense regions in other transcriptionally active regions of the genome. These elements are more clustered in genes which are involved in metabolism, transport, and signaling processes. In contrast, they are significantly fewer in genes coding for information pathway components as well as structural proteins. This bias in Alu distribution is independent of the effect of Alu density of the flanking genomic region and is also not affected by the GC content of the gene and its upstream and downstream regions. The relative proportions of Alu subfamilies (Alu J, Alu S, and Alu Y) are not significantly different in genes with high Alu density belonging to the functional categories of transport, metabolism, and signaling. We suggest that Alu elements might be involved in regulatory mechanisms and are therefore differentially selected in primate genomes. Sequence analysis demonstrated these "young" Alu insertions represented gene conversion events of pre-existing ancient Alu elements or independent parallel insertions of older Alu elements in the same genomic region.  This study suggests that the majority of Alu insertions in primate genomes are the products of unique evolutionary events. Our screening of the Alu insertion loci also resulted in the recovery of several "young" Alu elements that resided at orthologous positions in nonhuman primate genomes.

52f89fd32059c6d71c000051	List interaction partners for the protein GATA1.	Our work describes, for the first time, distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9.  Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis.  LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and down regulates the expression of GPA. We identify novel transcription factor binding partners for PIAS3 including ETS, EGR1, NR1I2, and GATA1. At other differentiation stages, additional combinatorial interactions occurred between RUNX1 and its coregulators, GATA1 and ETS.  Ldb1, a ubiquitously expressed LIM domain binding protein, is essential in a number of tissues during development. It interacts with Gata1, Tal1, E2A and Lmo2 to form a transcription factor complex regulating late erythroid genes.  Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. Here we show that Ski interacts with GATA1, a transcription factor essential in erythropoiesis. Using a Ski mutant deficient in GATA1 binding, we show that this Ski-GATA1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress GATA1-mediated transcription and block erythroid differentiation.  The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1.  tudies involving point mutants of GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another.

H2A.Z is an evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved H2A variant that regulates processes ranging from gene expression to the DNA damage response activation of DNA damage checkpoints (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX (H2AFX))) the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.X and H2A.Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cell histone variants (H2AX and H2A.Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) H2A.Z incorporation in the coding regions of genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of meiosis and genotoxic stress responses  phosphorylation of H2AX, a DNA damage signal DSB) are generally considered the most critical lesion induced by ionizing radiation (IR phosphorylated forms of histone H2AX  H2AX has a complete SQ(E/D)varphi (where varphi denotes a hydrophobic residue) known to be phosphorylated in response to DNA damage H2A.X, plays a very important role in the cellular response to DNA damage H2A.X is an H2A variant present in multicellular organisms that is specifically phosphorylated on the serine in the C-terminal consensus sequence, canonically "SQEY," in response to DNA damage. H2AFX) is important in maintaining chromatin structure and genetic stability Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the linker histone HHO1 is involved in DNA repair H1 variant, H1R is involved in DNA damage response high levels of histone H2AX phosphorylation and an increased incorporation of the Htz1p histone variant into chromatin surrounding the DSB TRF2 upregulation was more dramatic in drug-resistant cells and occurred before the expression of ATM, gammaH2AX and p53 DNA double-strand breaks induced by anticancer drugs or irradiation increase TRF2 expression Histone variant H2AX and core histone H2A are phosphorylated in mammals and budding yeast, respectively. We demonstrate the DSB-induced phosphorylation of histone variant H2Av in Drosophila melanogaster formation of a double-strand break (DSB) in chromosomal DNA is highly conserved H2A variants, H2AX and H2AZ. H2AX is phosphorylated on a serine four residues from the carboxyl terminus in response to the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks In response to IR, ZNF668 knockdown reduces Tip60-H2AX interaction and impairs IR-induced histone H2AX hyperacetylation, thus impairing chromatin relaxation. RPA foci formation were reduced in parallel with increasing levels of H2AX phosphorylation H2AX phosphorylation on a C-terminal serine residue to form "γ-H2AX" is a critical early event in the chromatin response to chromosomal DNA double strand breaks in eukaryotes The phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (gammaH2AX) is one of the best examples of histone PTMs in response to DNA damage induction One of the most well-characterized modifications is caused by the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), resulting in phosphorylation of histone H2AX (the so-called gamma-H2AX) on the chromatin surrounding the DNA lesion H2AX appears to be mainly associated with maintaining the genome integrity by participating in the repair of the double-stranded DNA breaks exogenously introduced by environmental damage (ionizing radiation, chemicals) or in the process of homologous recombination during meiosis The sustained localization of BMI1 to damage sites is dependent on intact ATM and ATR and requires H2AX phosphorylatio unique functional interactions among various chromatin modifiers, suggesting new regulatory pathways, such as a heterochromatin-specific modulation of DNA damage response involving H2A.X and WICH, both enriched in silent domains	[['H2A.X'], ['H2A.Z'], ['H1R']]
52f895602059c6d71c000040	List tele monitoring applications of miniaturised sensors	Home-polysomnography (HPSG) has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis. We assessed, in a feasibility study, whether telematic transmission using the Dream® and Sleepbox® technologies was associated with low HPSG failure rate  In this study, we monitored remotely self-measured body weight and blood pressure, in parallel with the data automatically transmitted by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Body weight, patient activity, and the difference between MHR and RHR are mutually correlated and may reasonably contribute to an algorithm for predicting heart failure deterioration. Blood pressure appears to offer no additional value. As both genesis and symptoms of heart failure exacerbation are non-uniform and complex, the telemonitoring concepts for heart failure patients should employ continuous monitoring of multiple diagnostic parameters, rather than rely on a single parameter. System and can collect users' vital signs with a set of wireless sensors this terminal is very helpful in special circumstances such as disaster relief, dangerous outdoor sports and adventure monitoring, and antiterrorism activities. A new, phonocardiography-based telemetric fetal home monitoring system. The input element of the system was the home monitor with two sensors for recording the trans-abdominal fetal heart signal and the uterine contractions. T Telemonitoring is currently being used in community-based healthcare, at the scene of medical emergencies, by ambulance services and in hospitals.  Mobile telemonitoring for achieving tighter targets of blood pressure control in patients with complicated diabetes:  Patients in the intervention arm transmitted weekly blood pressure readings wirelessly, using adapted sensors via mobile phones to a central server.  In patients with diabetes, mobile telemonitoring has potential for delivering intensified care to improve blood pressure control, and its use may be associated with reduced exposure to hyperglycemia. A new codivilla-spring prosthesis with sensors for telemonitoring / telerehabilitation has been designed and constructed. It provides step counting This article is a survey of systems, algorithms and sensors, for the automatic early detection of the fall of elderly persons.  We describe a vital sign telemonitor (VST) that acquires, records, displays, and provides readings such as: electrocardiograms (ECGs), temperature (T), and oxygen saturation (SaO2) over the Internet to any site. The design of this system consisted of three parts: sensors, analog signal processing circuits, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).  The paper describes the development of biomedical clothing for ambulatory telemonitoring of human vital parameters.

551829a76487737b43000009	List the diseases for which there are point-of-care breath tests	Additionally, we try to clarify controversial issues concerning possible experimental malpractice in the field, and propose ways to translate the basic science results as well as the mechanistic understanding to tools (sensors) that could serve as point-of-care diagnostics of cancer. Point of care monitoring of hemodialysis patients with a breath ammonia measurement device based on printed polyaniline nanoparticle sensors.  Excellent intraindividual correlations were demonstrated between breath ammonia and BUN (0.86 to 0.96), which demonstrates the possibility of using low cost point of care breath ammonia systems as a noninvasive means of monitoring kidney dysfunction and treatment. Recently, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has emerged as an important biomarker for the assessment and management of asthma. Here we discuss the potential of adapting a technology from the electronics industry, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, for diagnosis of multiple markers of sepsis in real time, using non-invasive assays of exhaled breath condensate.  Together these data indicate that FeNO testing has an important role in the assessment and management of adult asthma.  Measurement of acetone in human breath samples has been previously shown to provide significant non-invasive diagnostic insight into the control of a patient's diabetic condition.   Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and treatment response. These animal model results suggest that exhaled breath can be used as a point-of-care tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis. Point-of-care breath test for biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis. RATIONALE: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath provide biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB) because Mycobacterium tuberculosis manufactures VOC metabolites that are detectable in the breath of infected patients.  CONCLUSIONS: A six-minute point-of-care breath test for volatile biomarkers accurately identified subjects with active pulmonary TB. Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) can measure volatile compounds in breath on-line in real time and has the potential to provide accurate breath tests for a number of inflammatory, infectious and metabolic diseases, including diabetes. Breath analysis by SIFT-MS offers a rapid, reproducible and easily performed measurement of acetone concentration in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes.  IGR is a new approach for non-invasive cardiac output measurement in mechanically ventilated individuals, but requires further investigation for clinical use. The liver metabolic breath test relies on measuring exhaled (13) C tagged methacetin, which is metabolized only by the liver. Measuring this liver-specific substrate by means of molecular correlation spectroscopy is a rapid, non-invasive method for assessing liver function at the point-of-care.  Our recent findings regarding the ability of point-of-care (13) C MBT to assess the hepatic functional reserve in patients with acute and chronic liver disease are reviewed along with suggested treatment algorithms for common liver disorders. 13[C]-urea breath test as a novel point-of-care biomarker for tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The non-invasive real-time BreathID GBT reliably assesses changes in liver glucose metabolism, and the degree of insulin resistance.  DISCUSSION: The LiMAx test can validly determine liver function capacity and is feasible in every clinical situation. A P(ET,CO(2)) of >or=36 mmHg may reliably exclude PE. Accuracy is augmented by combination with Wells score. P( ET,CO(2)) should be prospectively compared to D-dimer in accuracy and simplicity to exclude PE. Point-of-care continuous (13)C-methacetin breath test improves decision making in acute liver disease: results of a pilot clinical trial. CONCLUSION: The (13)C-MBT provides a rapid, non-invasive assessment of liver function in acute severe liver disease of diverse etiologies.  CONCLUSION: The determination of CO by IGR and CWD revealed a good agreement and reproducibility with a low rate of impossible measurements, suggesting that IGR and CWD can be used interchangeably in the clinical setting. BACKGROUND: Exhaled NO (FE(NO)) is a useful biomarker for the monitoring of asthma control and response to therapy.  A high percentage of patients with different severities of asthma and regardless of their treatment with ICS and current smoking habit (current and/or ex-smokers) had highly elevated FE(NO) values, suggesting that their current therapy was possibly insufficient to control the underlying degree of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. H. pylori-positive status was defined by positivity on at least 2 tests: a commercial H. pylori stool antigen enzyme immunoassay, an immunoglobulin G antibody enzyme immunoassay, and the C-urea breath test End-tidal carbon dioxide measurements in children with acute asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive bedside measurement of EtCO2 values among children with acute asthma is feasible.  Review article: the assessment of liver function using breath tests. The recent development of a real-time, point-of-care liver function breath test has made it straightforward to assess the metabolic function of the liver. RESULTS: The (13)C-methacetin breath test enables accurate follow-up of patients with acute or chronic liver damage, where overall hepatic function is significantly suppressed by known causes of liver disorders, including acute, sub-acute or chronic conditions.  CONCLUSIONS: Breath testing that provides continuous quantification of methacetin metabolism may be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disorders.  A multi-center study in a multi-ethnic population compared the RAPIRUN urine antibody test with the (13)C-urea breath test (C-UBT) and a traditional serologic test, the high-molecular-weight cell-associated protein enzyme immunoassay (HM-CAP EIA).  CONCLUSION: EGA provided non-invasive, accurate, continuous, high-resolution COHb% measurements. Applying EGA to carboxyhaemoglobin dilution, we achieved RCV measurements with accuracy equivalent to that of CO-haemoximetry, with one-fifth of the COB infusion volume.  These results suggest that the IR device, which is small, light-weight, and rugged may enable the foreign gas uptake method to be used in clinical, field, and point-of-care settings for Q (T) measurement. UNLABELLED: The 13C-urea breath test provides non-invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection with the possibility of analysis at the point of care.  CONCLUSION: Fdlate, a variable of VCap, had a statistically better diagnostic performance in suspected PE than the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) gradient.   In conclusion, the investigated rebreathing system allows for a non-invasive determination of PBF at the bedside.  Non-invasive measurement of pulmonary blood flow during prone positioning in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 13C-urea breath test provides accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of active Helicobacter pylori infection and can document posttherapy cure.  A portable Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) multicomponent point-of-care analyzer was tested for the diagnosis of methanol intoxications. Breath analysis with FT-IR was fast and easy, and no sample preparation was needed. CONCLUSIONS: The Fd(late) is a valuable tool for bedside screening of PE in surgical patients.

52bf209303868f1b0600001a	What are the indications for alteplase?	In Japan, intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), was approved for an indication of ischemic stroke in 2005 on the basis of the results of a clinical trial with a unique dose of the drug (0.6 mg/kg).  Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited. The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children. To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients.  Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator improves outcomes in patients treated early after stroke but at the risk of causing intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is the only approved thrombolytic agent at present indicated for acute ischaemic stoke. This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from the manufacturer to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process. The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days. Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months. The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities. Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated. Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation.  Alteplase is the first thrombolytic drug to be approved in France for the treatment of ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptom onset. However, the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke suggests that alteplase is the most promising treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.   To determine whether cryopreserved solutions of the thrombolytic agent alteplase could be used as a safe, effective, and economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in patients presenting with occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). Alteplase has been reported as an efficacious alternative to urokinase for treatment of occluded CVADs.  Patients presenting with occluded CVADs received a sufficient volume of the thawed alteplase solution to fill the occluded catheter(s).  Cryopreserved 1-mg/mL aliquots of alteplase are safe and effective in the clearance of occluded CVADs when stored at -20 degrees C for 30 days. The ability to cryopreserve alteplase aliquots makes it an economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in the setting of CVAD occlusion. Of the thrombolytic agents and therapeutic protocols in use, alteplase 100 mg/2 hours seems to be the best compromise between the risk of bleeding and efficacy in reducing pulmonary resistances by 30 to 40% and relatively early pulmonary revascularisation of 40-50%.  To explore the best regimen of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism(APE), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-h infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, Alteplase (rt-PA) and urokinase(UK).  A 2 h regimen of rt-PA or UK showed reliable efficacy and safety for treatment of APE. The indication of thrombolytic therapy can be extended. Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase. Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries.  Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min. A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI. An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention. Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period. Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis. However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease. Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate.  Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI. The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate. Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion. However, its use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as extensively documented. Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are scarce. Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism. The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA).  In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients. Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not proven in a satisfactory manner. Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more readily than occlusive thrombi. For this indication the optimal dose regimens for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not established.  To save 1 year of life, the costs of thrombolytic therapy using intravenous streptokinase, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) or anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex) under standard restricted indication criteria, vary from 1000 pounds British sterling to 1700 pounds British sterling in the UK, SEK3090 to 9660 in Scandinavia and $US35 000 to 800 000 in the US, depending on time delay in starting treatment after pain onset, size of infarct, thrombolytic agents used, study methodology, lists of clinical events considered in cost counting and the discount rate. Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis. Further studies are needed to define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication. Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension.  The local treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively.  More recently, new drugs like alteplase, reteplase, lanoteplase and saruplase have been a breakthrough in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children Some acute ischemic strokes (before the 3rd hour) could be treated with alteplase if there is no absolute or relative contraindication for thrombolysis. Alteplase and reteplase are the most efficient thrombolytics despite a higher risk of cerebral bleeding.

55152bd246478f2f2c000002	List scaffold proteins of the ERK signaling pathway.	Human disc-large homolog (hDlg), also known as synapse-associated protein 97, is a scaffold protein, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, implicated in neuronal synapses and epithelial-epithelial cell junctions whose expression and function remains poorly characterized in most tissues, particularly in the vasculature.  Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human aorta cDNA library, we identified mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)2, a member of the ERK cascade, as an hDlg binding partner. Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses. Here, we show that two scaffold proteins, caveolin-1 and IQGAP1, are required for phosphorylation of the actin associated pool of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in response to protein kinase C activation. ERK activation is enhanced by the scaffolding proteins KSR and MP1, localized near the cell membrane and late endosomes respectively, but little is known about their dynamic interplay.  Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells. These scaffolds include KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), beta-arrestin, MEK partner-1, Sef and IQGAP1. Here we analyze a potential scaffold of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), by generating KSR-deficient mice.  This demonstrates that KSR is a bona fide scaffold that is not required for but enhances signaling via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. We reported previously that several 14-3-3 isotypes bind to protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta and facilitate coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 [van der Hoeven, van der Wal, Ruurs, van Dijk and van Blitterswijk (2000) Biochem. J. 345, 297-306], an event that boosts the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) pathway in Rat-1 fibroblasts.  In this study, IQGAP1 (IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1), a new Nrf2 interaction partner that we have published previously, was found to modulate MEK-ERK-mediated Nrf2 activation and induction of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes. In the aggregate, these results suggest that IQGAP1 may play an important role in the MEK-ERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway.  Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses. The MAP kinase ERK and its scaffold protein MP1 interact with the chromatin regulator Corto during Drosophila wing tissue development. KSR-1 is a scaffold protein that is essential for Ras-induced activation of the highly conserved RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Previously, we identified a close homolog of KSR-1, called KSR-2, through structural homology-based data mining The scaffold protein beta-arrestin2 interacted with both p-ERK and D1 DA receptor, triggering the cytosolic retention of p-ERK and inducing striatal neuronal apoptotic death.  Involvement of the MP1 scaffold protein in ERK signaling regulation during Drosophila wing development. Beta-arrestin mediates desensitization and internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs), but also acts as a scaffold protein in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Recent studies indicate that kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR)is a scaffold protein for the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in mammals.  The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates cell signaling through the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade and positively regulates ERK signaling. Our results indicate that KSR-2 may act as a scaffold protein similar as KSR-1 to mediate the MAPK core (RAF-MEK-ERK) signaling but with a distinct RAF isoform specificity, namely KSR-2 may only mediate the A-RAF signaling while KSR-1 is responsible for transducing signals only from c-RAF. Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts with the core kinase components of the ERK cascade, Raf, MEK, ERK to provide spatial and temporal regulation of Ras-dependent ERK cascade signaling. These findings identify KSR2 as a Ca2+-regulated ERK scaffold and reveal a new mechanism whereby Ca2+ impacts Ras to ERK pathway signaling. MEK Partner-1 (MP1) was identified as a potential "scaffold" protein for the mammalian extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway The scaffold protein MP1 (MEK1 partner) assembles a scaffold complex in the ERK cascade IQGAP1 scaffold-MAP kinase (ERK) interaction was noted in the human myeloma RPMI8226 cell lines. In conclusion, IQGAP1 plays an important role in the cell proliferation of MM via the MAP kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK-regulated, metastasis-associated scaffold protein Ezrin bsence of kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), a scaffold protein of the ERK signaling pathway GAB2 is a scaffold protein with diverse upstream and downstream effectors. MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are known effectors of GAB2. In Drosophila, dMP1, that encodes an ERK scaffold protein, regulates ERK signaling during wing development and contributes to intervein and vein cell differentiation. Scaffold proteins regulate intracellular MAP kinase signaling by providing critical spatial and temporal specificities. We have shown previously that the scaffold protein MEK1 partner (MP1) is localized to late endosomes by the adaptor protein p14. The scaffold protein Shoc2/SUR-8 accelerates the interaction of Ras and Raf. We propose that Shoc2 regulates the spatio-temporal patterns of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway primarily by accelerating the Ras-Raf interaction. Proteomic characterization of the dynamic KSR-2 interactome, a signaling scaffold complex in MAPK pathway. Kinase modules are associated with scaffold proteins that regulate signaling by providing critical spatial and temporal specificities. Some of these scaffold proteins have been shown to be conserved, both in sequence and function. In mouse, the scaffold MP1 (MEK Partner 1) forms a signaling complex with MEK1 and ERK1.   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway scaffold protein MP1.  We propose that MORG1 is a component of a modular scaffold system that participates in the regulation of agonist-specific ERK signaling.  IQGAP1, a scaffold protein linking cadherin-mediated cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton. This effect was accompanied by reduction of N-cadherin/IQGAP1/Erk-2 interactions. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a Rho-activated scaffold protein for the ERK MAP kinase cascade.

52f129d92059c6d71c000009	Which diseases are associated with Alu element insertion?	Alu elements are known to be the source of microsatellite repeats responsible for two other repeat expansion disorders: Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10. We identified an Alu-element insertion located in intron 7 of OPA1 causing an in-frame deletion of exon 8 in 18 family members. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy caused by mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene. However, this is the first report of a pathogenic OPA1 gene mutation resulting from an Alu insertion. The first reported case of Menkes disease caused by an Alu insertion mutation We present the first reported case of Menkes disease caused by an Alu element insertion mutation that interfered with splicing regulatory elements. HIGM syndrome caused by insertion of an AluYb8 element in exon 1 of the CD40LG gene A new mutation of the CD40LG gene that encodes the CD40 ligand molecule was characterized in a young patient harboring a hyper-IgM with immunodeficiency syndrome. Inactivation of CD40LG gene resulted from the insertion of an AluYb8 element in exon 1 responsible for a total deficiency of CD40 ligand expression by T lymphocytes. Alu-element insertion in the homeodomain of HESX1 and aplasia of the anterior pituitary One patient, who also has retinal coloboma, carries a HESX1 defect in the homozygous state: an Alu insertion in exon 3, a sequence that encodes the major part of the homeodomain. Anterior pituitary aplasia is a new example of a human disease caused by a germline retrotransposition event involving an Alu sequence. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with abnormal expansions of the CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of its gene. Previous studies in individuals of European origin demonstrated strong linkage disequilibrium between different CTG repeat length alleles and an Alu element insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 8 of the DM gene	[['myotonic dystrophy type 2'], ['Friedreich ataxia'], ['spinocerebellar ataxia type 10'], ['autosomal dominant optic atrophy'], ['Menkes disease'], ['hyper-IgM with immunodeficiency syndrome (HIGM)'], ['anterior pituitary aplasia'], ['HNPCC'], ['FAP']]
55192f20622b194345000014	Which proteins are the different members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors?	The transcription factor NF-kappaB is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of Rel/NF-kappaB-family polypeptides, which include Rel-A, c-Rel, Rel-B, NF-kappaB/p50 and NF-kappaB2/p52 . Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) is a dimeric transcription factor comprised of five family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 and p52. In mammals, the genes rela, relb, crel, nfkappaΒ1, and nfkappaB encode the five NF-kB protein family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, respectively, which form homo- and heterodimeric DNA-binding complexes capable of regulating target gene transcription of specific biological responses differentially. These results suggest that the Rel-homology domain can act as an allosteric effector to promote transcription by p50/NFkappaB1 and that the configuration of p50 is important for its activity.

[A case with Rotor syndrome in hyperbilirubinemic family]. Hyperbilirubinemia syndromes (Gilbert-Meulengracht, Crigler-Najjar, Dubin-Johnson, and Rotor syndrome) Rotor syndrome is a rare, benign familial disorder characterized by chronic fluctuating, nonhemolytic and predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal hepatic histology Jaundice is often the first and sometimes the only symptom of liver disease. Besides in parenchymal liver disease jaundice is also observed in chronic non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinemias (Crigler-Najjar type I and II, Gilbert's syndrome) and in hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemias (Dubin-Johnson- and Rotor-syndrome).  Rotor syndrome is a rare, benign familial disorder characterized by chronic fluctuating, nonhemolytic and predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal hepatic histology.

551910d3622b194345000008	Which proteins have been identified as RET ligands?	Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the 4 RET ligands, GDNF, NTN, ARTN, PSPN, and susceptibility to Hirschsprung disease Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487 The ligands bind RET through GDNF family receptor alpha, termed GFRalpha1-4 RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin GDNF availability determines enteric neuron number by controlling precursor proliferation Five germline mutations in the glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene, one of the RET ligands, have been detected in HSCR patients. The glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors alpha (GFRalpha) are cell surface bound glycoproteins that mediate interactions of the GDNF ligand family with the RET receptor In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.  Mutations in genes that encode RET ligands (GDNF and NTN); components of another signaling pathway (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE-1); and the transcription factor, SOX10, have been identified in HSCR patients. Expression of RET and its ligand complexes, GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2, in medullary thyroid carcinomas Mutations in the GDNF gene, and encoding one of the RET ligands, either alone or in combination with RET mutations, can also cause HSCR, as can mutations in four other genes (EDN3, EDNRB, ECE1, and SOX10) In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.  Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin. Mutation of the RET ligand, neurturin, supports multigenic inheritance in Hirschsprung disease Considering that RET and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mutations have been reported in the disease, we regarded the other RET ligand, neurturin (NTN), as an attractive candidate gene, especially as it shares large homologies with GDNF Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease The c-ret protooncogene, RET, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a ligand of RET tyrosine kinase, and its family ligands promote the survival and differentiation of a variety of neurons. We demonstrate here that, after injury, the absence of c-Jun specifically in SCs caused impaired axonal regeneration and severely increased neuronal cell death. c-Jun deficiency resulted in decreased expression of several neurotrophic factors, and GDNF and Artemin, both of which encode ligands for the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, were identified as novel direct c-Jun target genes. GDNF, now known to be the first identified member of a family of factors, signals through the previously known receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret. Unlike most ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, GDNF does not bind and activate Ret directly, but requires the presence of GPI-linked coreceptors. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In 1996, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was identified as one of the ligands of the RET transmembrane receptor. The ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose ligands belong to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein family. RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin. Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor molecule GDNFR-alpha, have recently been identified as members of the RET ligand binding complex Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET Replacing short segments of GDNF with the homologous segments from persephin (PSPN) (which cannot bind or activate GFRalpha1.RET or GFRalpha2.RET) identified sites along the second finger of GDNF critical for activating the GFRalpha1.RET and GFRalpha2.RET receptor complexes GDNF mediates its actions through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a ligand-binding glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (designated GDNFR-alpha) and the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase Ret	[['GDNF', 'glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor'], ['ARTN', 'artemin'], ['NTN', 'neurturin'], ['PSPN', 'persephin']]

52fb78d82059c6d71c000068	Which mutations of SCN5A gene are implicated in Brugada syndrome?	This was the first study to systematically investigate sodium channel variants in Chinese patients with ARVD; a new SCN5A mutation, I137M, was found.  We describe a family showing the association between Brugada syndrome and epilepsy in which a known mutation in the SCN5A gene (p.W1095X, c.3284G>A) was identified.  Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a life-threatening arrhythmia disorder associated with autosomal-dominant mutations in the SCN5A gene. We aimed to characterize the diagnostic challenges and clinical manifestations of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with BrS. RESULTS: From a novel SCN5A mutation (c.664C>T; p.Arg222X) identified in a proband with the characteristic electrocardiographic pattern and the history of sudden collapse, 122 family members were studied including 40 carriers of the mutation.  We analyzed the sequence of this gene in 25 Spanish patients with Brugada syndrome. In 4 (16%), we found mutations that had not previously been described: three were amino acid changes (i.e. Ala2>Thr, Ala735>Thr and Val1340>Ile) and one was an intron mutation that affected messenger RNA processing (i.e. IVS18-1G>A). The 4 most frequent BrS1-associated mutations were E1784K (14x), F861WfsX90 (11x), D356N (8x), and G1408R (7x). One missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region among the cohort of 19 patients. A H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele.  Thus, we studied the functional restoration of nonsense-mutated SCN5A. RESULTS: HEK293 cells were transfected with SCN5A cDNA or its mutant carrying W822X, a nonsense mutation associated with Brugada syndrome and sudden cardiac death.  Among the cohort of 19 patients, one missense mutation (G400A) in SCN5A was detected in a conserved region. An H558R polymorphism was detected on the same allele. Novel SCN5A mutation (Q55X) associated with age-dependent expression of Brugada syndrome presenting as neurally mediated syncope. A novel nonsense SCN5A mutation (Q55X) was identified in the proband, his mother, and his asymptomatic brother. Novel SCN5A gene mutations associated with Brugada syndrome: V95I, A1649V and delF1617 An intronic mutation (c.4810+3_4810+6dupGGGT) in the SCN5A gene, located outside the consensus splice site, was detected in this study in a family with a highly variable clinical phenotype of Brugada syndrome and/or conduction disease and in a patient with Brugada syndrome. We genetically screened 30 asymptomatic probands (29 men and 1 woman; mean age 47.1 years) exhibiting a spontaneous Brugada-type ECG. Family members of patients with Brugada syndrome were excluded from the study.  Genetic screening failed to identify SCN5A mutations in most cases but demonstrated a novel double missense mutation (K1527R and A1569P) located on the same allele in another asymptomatic subject (case 2). We screened patients with SUNDS for mutations in SCN5A, the gene known to cause Brugada syndrome, as well as genes encoding ion channels associated with the long-QT syndrome. One mutation, R367H, lies in the first P segment of the pore-lining region between the DIS5 and DIS6 transmembrane segments of SCN5A. A second mutation, A735V, lies in the first transmembrane segment of domain II (DIIS1) close to the first extracellular loop between DIIS1 and DIIS2, whereas the third mutation, R1192Q, lies in domain III. The substitution (D1790G) causes LQTS and the insertion (D1795) induces both LQTS and Brugada syndromes in carrier patients.

52f4f1d62059c6d71c00001c	Which are the clinical characteristics of isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy?	Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder caused by the arrest of myocardial compaction during embryogenesis, leading to a non compacted endocardial layer with marked hypertrabeculation and deep recesses. The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 ± 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 ± 10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved in all the cases. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 40%o. Prominent hypertrabecularisation (ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium >2) in the apical and mid left ventricular segments is typical for non-compaction cardiomyopathy.  Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during early embryogenesis. Sudden cardiac death (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40). LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, heart failure in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious sick sinus syndrome (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients.

533c384dc45e133714000006	In which genomic positions is the histone variant macroH2A enriched?	Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A1, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin This repressor activity is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold mH2A1 consistently colocalizes with a heterochromatin marker (H3K27me2; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27) and mH2A2 with a euchromatin marker (H3K4me3; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4) Similar results were found for the L41gene, with enrichment of mH2A in the promoter region. By using highly specific antibodies against mH2A1 and stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mH2A1 or GFP-H2A, we found that the Xi chromosome contains approximately 1.5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome. Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes. macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing. We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies. These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB) In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome. Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2 before reforming in late G1, macroH2A1 remains associated during mitosis with specific regions of the Xi, including at the X inactivation center	[['Repressed regions'], ['Inactive X chromosome'], ['Centromeres']]
54e071e11388e8454a00000d	Which agents are included in the FLAMSA chemotherapy regimen?	After 3 days of rest, RIC was carried out, consisting of 4 Gy total body irradiation, antithymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius), and cyclophosphamide (fludarabine, amsacrine, and cytarabine (FLAMSA)-RIC protocol). We report a retrospective single center analysis of aplasia-inducing chemotherapy using fludarabine, cytarabine, and amsacrine (FLAMSA) followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 62 consecutive primary refractory or relapsed AML patients. A sequential regimen of cytoreductive chemotherapy (fludarabine, high-dose AraC, amsacrine) followed by reduced intensity conditioning (FLAMSA-RIC), was uniformly used for conditioning. Between November 2003 and June 2010, 30 patients (20 high-risk MDS, 10 sAML) received fludarabine (4 × 30 mg/m(2)), amsacrine (4 × 100 mg/m(2)), and Ara-C (4 × 2 g/m(2), FLAMSA).

5506e2ff8e1671127b00000d	Which are the subunits of the IkB protein kinase (IKK)?	NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) associates with catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ to form the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and is a key regulator of NF-κB pathway signaling. All known NF-κB activators converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex to activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKγ that regulates the canonical NF-κB pathway, whereas IKKα regulates the non-canonical pathway.  The IKK protein complex is comprised of IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO subunits, with IKKβ thought to play the dominant role in modulating NF-κB activity.  The IκB kinase (IKK) complex plays a crucial role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by phosphorylating an inhibitory molecule IκBα. Recently, we showed that IKK2 (also called IKKβ), a catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, induces immunoglobulin E-mediated degranulation in mast cells by phosphorylating SNAP-23, the target-membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE). The depletion of any of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) kinase (IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO), each of which is essential for the canonical NFκB activation pathway, limits autophagy induction by physiological or pharmacological triggers, while constitutive active IKK subunits suffice to stimulate autophagy.  NF-κB activation is tightly regulated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO. Activation of the classical NF-κB pathway is mediated through the activity of the IKK kinase complex, which consists of a heterotrimer of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ subunits.  NF-kB is a key regulator of inflammation and immunity in cancer development. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-α, -β and -γ.  Activation of NF-κB involves the IκB kinase (IKK)-complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory scaffold protein, IKKγ. The IKK kinase complex is the core element of the NF-kappaB cascade. It is essentially made of two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKgamma. Additional components may exist, transiently or permanently, but their characterization is still unsure. Activation of NF-kappaB subunits is regulated by the upstream IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex which contains IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma; the latter also known as NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). Proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation requires the IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). Inhibition of NF-kappaB by suppressing the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway, for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKK1, IKK2 and NEMO) triggers apoptosis in such cells.  The IkappaB-Kinase (IKK) complex is a multisubunit protein complex crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation of the IkappaB proteins and thus controls the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Besides the two kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the IKK complex contains NEMO/IKKgamma, an additional subunit with regulatory and adaptor functions. Activation of a large multisubunit protein kinase, called the inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, is central to the induction of the family of transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB. IKK is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory IKKgamma subunit. The IkB kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit complex containing catalytic subunits termed IKK-α, -β and -γ	[['IKKalpha', 'IKKα', 'IKK1'], ['IKKbeta', 'IKKβ', 'IKK2'], ['IKKgamma', 'IKKγ', 'NEMO']]

5148e1d6d24251bc0500003a	Mutation of which gene and which chromosome cause Neurofibromatosis type I?	The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. Nine markers from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 were typed in 16 British and five South African families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Inspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers suggests that the NF1 gene is located between the markers EW301 (cen-p11.2) and EW206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to pHHH202 (q11.2-q12). The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17. In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use. To better map the location of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7AE-11. This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17. The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint. The frequent LOH surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with NF1. In the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots and axillary freckling. In addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis I gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of NF1. Duplicon-mediated microdeletions around the NF1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type I in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower IQ values. Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans. It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. In 95% of NF1 individuals, a mutation is found in the NF1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the NF1 gene and several flanking genes. Herein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented NF1. Genetic study (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated no chromosomal losses or gains. Testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the EGFR, p16, PTEN, MDM2 and NF1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of PTEN, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people. The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11.2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons. A patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type I is described. The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17. Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors. The NFI gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11.2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases. A novel mutation c.4821delA was identified in NF1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p.Leu1607fs). She had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene. RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members. Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene. We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation. The disease gene of the Chinese NF1 family was linked to NF1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, G1336X in the NF1 gene was identified. The present study demonstrated that G1336X mutation in the NF1 gene cause Neurofibromatosis type I in the family.	[['NF1 gene'], ['chromosome 17']]
515c4f05298dcd4e51000006	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 regulate in the heart?	A group of mice was treated with debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a selective TRα1 inhibitor (AMI-DBD) Furthermore, AMI resulted in β-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB). The latter further declined in AMI-DBD mainly due to increased expression of PLB We identified that mice expressing the mutant TRalpha1R384C (TRalpha1+m mice) displayed a mild bradycardia, which becomes more pronounced during night activity or on stress and is accompanied by a reduced expression of nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2 mRNA in the heart KCNE1 was four to 10-fold overexpressed in mice deficient in TRalpha1 The bradycardia and prolonged QT(end) time in hypothyroid states can be explained by altered K(+) channel function due to decreased TRalpha1-dependent repression of KCNE1 expression Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f) current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels. T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation. PE, in the absence of T3, resulted in 5.0 fold increase in TRalpha1 expression in nucleus and 2.0 fold decrease in TRalpha1 expression in cytosol, P<0.05. As a result, a fetal pattern of myosin isoform expression with marked expression of beta-MHC was observed in PE treated vs the untreated cells, P<0.05. PKC alpha overexpression in cardiomyocytes caused marked repression of triiodothyronine (T3)-responsive genes, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated adenosinetriphosphatase SERCA2. Treatment with T3 for 4 h resulted in significant reductions of PKC alpha in nuclear and cytosolic compartments, and decreased TR alpha1 mRNA and protein, with normalization of phenotype. The mechanism of TH and TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38 Excised TRalpha(1)+/m hearts showed an increased expression of phospholamban (PLB) administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), lpha-Myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) decreased in DRON while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT. The activity of TR DNA binding to the transcriptional regulatory region in the alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes and the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the heart and plasma 3,3'-triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were altered in association with changes in the myocardial TR protein levels. addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, and TRalpha1 to alpha-MyHC transcription and increased myocyte size OBJECTIVE: The reduced heart rate and prolonged QT(end) duration in mice deficient in thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1 may involve aberrant expression of the K(+) channel alpha-subunit KCNQ1 and its regulatory beta-subunit KCNE1.

52f509232059c6d71c00001f	Which genes are implicated in short QT syndrome?	A novel gain-of-function KCNJ2 mutation associated with short-QT syndrome impairs inward rectification of Kir2.1 currents. In this study, we identified a novel KCNJ2 gain-of-function mutation, M301K, associated with SQTS.  A mutation in genes related to SQTS was found in 23% of the probands; most of them had a gain of function mutation in HERG (SQTS1). We present, for the first time, a novel loss-of-function mutation coding for an L-type calcium channel subunit.  however, a new variant at a heterozygous state was identified in the CACNA2D1 gene (nucleotide c.2264G > C; amino acid p.Ser755Thr), coding for the Ca(v)α(2)δ-1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel. In the present study, we report the first pathogenic mutation in the CACNA2D1 gene in humans, which causes a new variant of SQTS. A novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene associated with short QT syndrome. The altered function of T618I-HERG channels suggests that this mutation in the KCNH2 gene is responsible for the SQTS phenotype in this family.  Gain of function mutations in three genes encoding K(+) channels have been identified, explaining the abbreviated repolarization seen in this condition: KCNH2 for I(kr) (SQT1), KCNQ1 for I(ks) (SQT2) and KCNJ2 for I(k1) (SQT3).  To evaluate the possible diagnosis of SQTS, DNA sequencing of genes known to be associated with SQTS was performed and identified a novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene. The mutation of genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) encoding for cardiac potassium channels plays a central role in SQTS.  To date, different mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome.  Mutations in 3 different genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and KCNJ2, all encoding cardiac ionic potassium channels have been identified in affected patients.  Genetic analysis has, to date, identified three distinct forms of the condition, involving gain-of-function mutations to three different cardiac potassium channel genes: KCNH2 (SQT1), KCNQ1 (SQT2) and KCNJ2 (SQT3).  Three different gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding for cardiac potassium channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) have been identified up to now to cause short QT syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Gradenigo's syndrome is nowadays a rare condition characterized by a triad of otorrhea, facial pain with trigeminal nerve involvement and abducens nerve palsy. Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare but life threatening complication of acute otitis media (AOM), which includes a classic triad of otitis media, deep facial pain and ipsilateral abducens nerve paralysis.  We report a case of typical Gradenigo's syndrome, including left abducens nerve palsy, left facial pain and paresthesia in V1 and V2 distribution of trigeminal nerve caused by solitary osseous plasmacytoma of the left petrous apex. BACKGROUND: Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare disease, which is characterized by the triad of the following conditions: suppurative otitis media, pain in the distribution of the first and the second division of trigeminal nerve, and abducens nerve palsy. RESULTS: It was after Gradenigo that the well-known syndrome consisting of diplopia and facial pain due to a middle ear infection was named. Gradenigo's syndrome, the triad of suppurative otitis media, abducens nerve palsy and pain in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, remains a rare complication of otitis media. In 1904, Giuseppe Gradenigo published his case series on the triad of ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy, facial pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution, and suppurative otitis media, which would subsequently be referred to as Gradenigo syndrome	[['otitis media'], ['deep facial pain'], ['abducens nerve paralysis']]

Mice expressing the mutant thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1R384C, which has a 10-fold reduced affinity to the ligand T(3), exhibit hypermetabolism due to an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. To define the consequences in the liver, we analyzed hepatic metabolism and the regulation of liver genes in the mutant mice. Our results showed that hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase was up-regulated and pyruvate kinase mRNA down-regulated, contrary to what observed after T(3) treatment Remarkably, there was an obligatory requirement for a TR, whether TRbeta or TRalpha1, for any detectable D1 expression in liver.

516ec97f298dcd4e51000087	By which methods can we evaluate the reliability of a phylogenetic tree?	For robustness evaluation, we apply bootstrap and jackknife techniques to input data. An alignment confidence score capturing robustness to guide tree uncertainty. We build on the widely used bootstrap method for perturbing the phylogenetic tree. SuperTRI: A new approach based on branch support analyses of multiple independent data sets for assessing reliability of phylogenetic inferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, called SuperTRI, which is based on the branch support analyses of the independent data sets, and where the reliability of the nodes is assessed using three measures: the supertree Bootstrap percentage and two other values calculated from the separate analyses: the mean branch support (mean Bootstrap percentage or mean posterior probability) and the reproducibility index. In contrast to other similar software, the program FreeTree (available at http://www.natur.cuni.cz/~flegr/programs/freetree or http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/vol51/issue3/) can also assess the robustness of the tree topology by bootstrap, jackknife or operational taxonomic unit-jackknife analysis. Unlike any previous tool for inferring phylogenies from rearrangement data, TIBA uses novel methods of robustness estimation to provide support values for the edges in the inferred tree. Fast and accurate phylogenetic reconstruction from high-resolution whole-genome data and a novel robustness estimator. Moreover, whereas phylogenetic analyses from sequence data are deemed incomplete unless bootstrapping scores (a measure of confidence) are given for each tree edge, no equivalent to bootstrapping exists for rearrangement-based phylogenetic analysis. We also describe a novel approach to estimate the robustness of results-an equivalent to the bootstrapping analysis used in sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction. The standard deviation also suggests the reliability level of the branch order. Assessment of the reliability of a given phylogenetic hypothesis is an important step in phylogenetic analysis. The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was probed with the bootstrapping of 100 replicates of the original sequence alignments.	[['bootstrap'], ['jackknife']]

56d8b47a51531f7e33000004	What are the main clinical characteristics of Pendred syndrome?	Obligatory features are profound deafness in childhood and defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. Therefore, goiter is a common symptom. Hypoplasia of the cochlea is another feature. If a child has progressive sensorineural deafness and a widened vestibular aqueduct, it is important to consider a diagnosis of Pendred syndrome.  Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, Pendred syndrome is a disease that shows congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, with a positive finding in the perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syndrome results from various mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene that cause production of an abnormal pendrin protein Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. It is caused by mutations in the PDS gene.  Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Aside from the branchio-otorenal syndrome, Pendred syndrome is the only other known genetic disorder with a widened vestibular aqueduct. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and sonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis in association with sensorineural hearing loss. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and widened vestibular aqueducts are characteristic features of Pendred's syndrome, which provides the opportunity to diagnose Pendred's syndrome clinically in the first few years of life, as has recently been suggested in a case report (Cremers et al., Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and a widend vestibular aqueduct in Pendred syndrome, Arch. Pendred syndrome is the most common syndromal form of deafness, yet the primary defect remains unknown. Pendred syndrome is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in patients with syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and ultrasonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis (elevated TSH, low T4/fT4, goitre or normal thyroid volume) in association with sensorineural hearing loss.

5506eca18e1671127b00000f	Which are the subunits of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the canonical pathway activation?	In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 UL42 protein, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, was a novel antagonism of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-α mediated NF-κB activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50.  Thus, it was first time we demonstrated that HSV-1 UL42 appeared to prevent NF-κB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 and p50 in the cytoplasm, and UL42-dependent transcriptional activation were inherently coupled to promote HSV-1 lytic replication, which also may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1. The review describes NF-κB and its two pathways: the canonical, mediated by the p65 and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical, mediated by the subunits RelB, p52 and p50.  The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has not yet been established. In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation.

51475d5cd24251bc0500001b	Where is X-ray free electron laser used?	In conjunction with the XFEL temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage. We discuss the pertinent physics of the intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the timescales of collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of biological systems, material science investigations, and the study of matter in extreme conditions. employment of "exotic" systems, such as the Free Electron LASER (FEL), that are expected to focus on the fundamental processes of life, following chemical reactions and biological processes as they happen, on unprecedented time and size scales.

These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump--probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. The use of femtosecond exposure times, rather than freezing of samples, as a means of minimizing radiation damage is shown to open up new opportunities for the molecular imaging of biochemical reactions at room temperature in solution New opportunities for solving the phase problem for XFEL data are outlined. A summary of the latest results is given, which now extend to atomic resolution for nanocrystals. Possibilities for time-resolved chemistry using fast WAXS (solution scattering) from mixtures is reviewed, toward the general goal of making molecular movies of biochemical processes. Molecular imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers. The recent development of X-ray free-electron laser sources has created new opportunities for the structural analysis of protein nanocrystals. X-ray free electron lasers hold the promise of enabling atomic-resolution diffractive imaging of single biological molecules. The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales. In this paper we report room temperature X-ray diffraction data of PS II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort (< 50 fs) 9 keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac Coherent Light Source. High-resolution protein structure determination by serial femtosecond crystallography We applied serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals (less than 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer by 3 micrometers) of the well-characterized model protein lysozyme. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. Here we recorded interpretable diffraction data from micrometer-sized lipidic sponge phase crystals of the Blastochloris viridis photosynthetic reaction center delivered into an X-FEL beam Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Single mimivirus particles intercepted and imaged with an X-ray laser Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources. With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. Diffractive imaging using the intense and coherent beam of X-ray free-electron lasers opens new perspectives for structural studies of single nanoparticles and biomolecules. The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination. Where possible we also highlight areas that we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane protein structural biology community. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) deliver short (<100 fs) and intense (∼10(12) photons) pulses of hard X-rays, making them excellent sources for time-resolved studies. Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. In single-particle coherent x-ray diffraction imaging experiments, performed at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), samples are exposed to intense x-ray pulses to obtain single-shot diffraction patterns. The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the "diffraction-before-destruction" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Ultrashort X-ray pulses from free-electron laser X-ray sources make it feasible to conduct small- and wide-angle scattering experiments on biomolecular samples in solution at sub-picosecond timescales. The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage destroys the sample. The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains largely unsolved. Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from x-ray free-electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data, or both. By combining serial nanocrystallography with x-ray free-electron laser sources in the future, it may be possible to produce molecular-resolution electron-density maps using membrane protein crystals that contain only a few hundred or thousand unit cells. Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the principle of collect and destroy.

54db7c4ac0bb8dce23000001	Which protein kinases have been found to phosphorylate Phospholamban and affect its biological activity?	Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects.  We have found that phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A (PKA) leads to an increase in the rate of Ca(2+) leak from Ca(2+)-loaded SR vesicles. PKG activity of cardiac myocytes was assessed by phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation determined by western blot.  PLB is not a unique reporter for PKG activity since it is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA),  Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays an important role mediating apoptosis/necrosis during ischemia-reperfusion (IR). The onset of reperfusion increased the phosphorylation of Thr(17) site of phospholamban, without changes in total protein, consistent with an increase in CaMKII activity.  We found that when activated, Akt interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr(17), the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIdelta site, whereas silencing Akt signaling, through the knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PLN at Thr(17).  Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Dephosphorylated PLN tonically inhibits the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a), while phosphorylation at Ser16 by PKA and Thr17 by Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) relieves the inhibition, and this increases SR Ca(2+) uptake.  Both CaMKIIdelta(C) and the novel CaMKIIbeta(4) isoforms were found to exist in complex with alphaKAP and SERCA2a at the SR and were able to phosphorylate Thr-17 on phospholamban (PLN), an accessory subunit and known regulator of SERCA2a activity Phospholamban is the major membrane protein of the heart phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. In cell-free systems, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes exclusive phosphorylation of serine 16 of phospholamban, whereas Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gives exclusive phosphorylation of threonine 17 (Simmerman, H. K. B., Collins, J. H., Theibert, J. L., Wegener, A. D., and Jones, L. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13333-13341).

51434c74d24251bc0500000c	What are the computational tools for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins?	In this work, we propose a method based on radial basis networks for predicting the number of beta-strands in OMPs and identifying their membrane spanning segments. We have developed a web server, TMBETAPRED-RBF for predicting the transmembrane beta-strands from amino acid sequence and it is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/tmrbf.html. We have developed a prediction server, TMBETADISC-RBF, which is available at http://rbf.bioinfo.tw/~sachen/OMP.html. TMB finding pipeline: novel approach for detecting beta-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences. Interestingly, the present approach identified TMBs from all 15 families in TCDB. A new method is presented for identification of beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture obeying these proteins' construction principles. Once the HMM is trained, log-odds score relative to a null model is used to discriminate beta-barrel membrane proteins from other proteins. PRED-TMBB: a web server for predicting the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins. We present here a web server (PRED-TMBB, http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB) which is capable of predicting the transmembrane strands and the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. The method is based on a Hidden Markov Model, trained according to the Conditional Maximum Likelihood criterion. Predicting transmembrane beta-barrels in proteomes. Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs. A sequence-profile-based HMM for predicting and discriminating beta barrel membrane proteins. RESULTS: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information. BOMP: a program to predict integral beta-barrel outer membrane proteins encoded within genomes of Gram-negative bacteria. This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. On the basis of existing knowledge of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins, several state of the art prediction methods, as well as a new in-house program (PROB) were employed for the systematic exploration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes for potential beta-barrel structures. Computational identification of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes as putative vaccine candidates. BETAWARE: a machine-learning tool to detect and predict transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in prokaryotes. Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. Supersecondary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane β-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods. BOCTOPUS: improved topology prediction of transmembrane β barrel proteins. Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). TMBHMM: a frequency profile based HMM for predicting the topology of transmembrane beta barrel proteins and the exposure status of transmembrane residues. We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. We present BTMX (Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure), a computational method to predict the exposure status (i.e. exposed to the bilayer or hidden in the protein structure) of transmembrane residues in transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs). BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84.2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions. A method for discovering transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in Gram-negative bacterial proteomes. A web server based on the proposed method is available at http://yanbioinformatics.cs.usu.edu:8080/TMBKNNsubmit. This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for discriminating TMB and non-TMB proteins. TMBpro: secondary structure, beta-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. A consensus algorithm to screen genomes for novel families of transmembrane beta barrel proteins. Here we describe a new algorithm combining composition and hidden Markov model topology based classifiers (called TMB-Hunt2), which achieves a crossvalidation accuracy of >95%, with 96.7% precision and 94.2% recall.

Lacritin is a novel human tear glycoprotein In primates, lacritin was produced in the lacrimal gland and secreted into tear fluid. Here we show by quantitative real-time PCR that lacritin is expressed in human breast tumors, breast cancer cell lines, and normal breast. The previously reported restricted expression pattern of lacritin is therefore incorrect.

53357c98d6d3ac6a3400004a	What genes are related to breast cancer?	Network analysis showed increased expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways were also highly expressed These results indicate that nuclear NRF2 protein plays important roles in the proliferation and/or progression of breast carcinoma, and nuclear NRF2 immunoreactivity is therefore considered a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients Our previous studies in breast cancer cells indicate that 2CdA and F-ara-A are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription  It seems to be a new important element of ClF anticancer activity and may indicate its potential efficacy in epigenetic therapy of solid tumours, especially at early stages of carcinogenesis many molecular components that regulate HR are tumour suppressors p53, a negative regulator and breast cancer early-onset (BRCA)2, a positive regulator. Both the players not only interact with each other but also directly interact with human RAD51 (hRAD51), the key recombinase in HR  Our findings suggest a rigorous p53-mediated regulation on hRAD51 functions in HR even in the presence of BRCA2 coordinated replication and transcription of pericentromeric repeats enable RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated transmission of pericentromeric heterochromatin in fission yeast, which is essential for the proper function of centromeres. Rad3/ATR kinase phosphorylates histone H2A on serine-128/-129 to create γH2A in pericentromeric heterochromatin during S phase, which recruits Brc1 through its breast cancer gene 1 protein (BRCA1) C-terminal (BRCT) domains protein BRCA2 affect its interactions with the recombinase RAD51 and are associated with an increased risk of cancer  serial deletion mutation experiments, binding strengths were increased when the C-terminal BRC repeat was removed from BRC1-8, BRC1-5 and BRC1-3. These results may provide an insight into the effects of missense or truncation mutations in BRCA2 in canine tumours. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses. Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts Genetic BRCA2 insufficiency is associated with breast cancer development; however, in sporadic breast cancer cases, high BRCA2 expression is paradoxically correlated with poor prognosis HER-2 and TOP2A gene amplification showed a tendency to be associated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, high level of apoptotic and proliferative indexes, and low level of p53 and Bcl-2 expression, which all together indicate group of patients with similar outcome during the progression of the disease	[['p53', 'TP53'], ['BRCA2'], ['NRF2'], ['BRCA1'], ['BRCT'], ['HER2', 'ERBB2', 'RPS2'], ['TOP2A'], ['TRIM22']]
54fb5720d176fff445000002	Which transcription factors are known as the four (4) "Yamanaka factors" that have been used to create induced pluripotent stem cells  (iPSCs)?	The recently established reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka represents a valuable tool for future therapeutic applications. In particular, the mechanisms how the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) directly drive reprogramming and which additional components are involved are still not yet understood. Here we show that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4)-expressing EV can also reprogram adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) into pluripotency, yet at a very low efficiency. The CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit contains four SeV-based reprogramming vectors, each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (i.e., Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and are optimized for generating iPSCs from human somatic cells. Delivery of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc via integrating viral vectors has been widely employed to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from both normal and disease-specific somatic tissues, providing an invaluable resource for medical research and drug development. We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable. Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the application of Yamanaka factors (OSKM), but the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming remain poorly understood. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM).  Through the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc, human somatic cells can be converted to a pluripotent state, generating so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(1-4). We have shown the generation of transgene-free human iPSCs from patients with different lung diseases using a single excisable polycistronic lentiviral Stem Cell Cassette (STEMCCA) encoding the Yamanaka factors(6). These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are created by the reprogramming of somatic cells via overexpression of certain transcription factors, such as the originally described Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) iPSC production was first achieved by transducing, with the use of retroviral vectors, four specific transcription factors: Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OKSM), into primary cells in culture Takahashi and Yamanaka, (Cell 126(4):663-676, 2006)	[['Oct4', 'Oct 3/4'], ['Sox2'], ['Klf4'], ['c-Myc']]
5363bad27d100faa0900000e	Which are the most abundant human lincRNA?	One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. Because viruses borrow molecular mechanisms from their hosts, we searched highly abundant human long-noncoding RNAs and identified putative ENE-like structures in metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and multiple endocrine neoplasia-β (MENβ) RNAs.  MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long nuclear-retained noncoding RNA. Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to have epigenetic regulatory function in humans, including HOTAIR and XIST. metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis. It is highly abundant, its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes, and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution. Thus, loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development. bundant expression of the long noncoding (lnc) PAN (polyadenylated nuclear) RNA by the human oncogenic gammaherpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) depends on a cis-element called the expression and nuclear retention element (ENE) alat1 is an abundant long, noncoding RNA that localizes to nuclear bodies known as nuclear speckles, which contain a distinct set of pre-mRNA processing factors. Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant and highly conserved lncRNAs, and it exhibits an uncommon 3'-end processing mechanism H19 large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is one of the most highly abundant and conserved transcripts in mammalian development, being expressed in both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages, yet its physiological function is unknown.  Our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species reveal no more than three abundant large non-coding polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus; the canonical large noncoding RNA XIST and NEAT1 and NEAT2 19, which is one of the most abundantly expressed imprinted genes during mammalian embryonic and foetal development, has been cloned from a ruminant H19 mRNA is highly abundant in most ovine embryonic and foetal tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origins but was not detected in tissues of ectodermal origin such as the trophectoderm and the foetal brain Abundant expression of H19 was evident in fetal bladder but was absent in normal adult bladder urthermore, we discuss results showing an abundant expression of H19 gene in some adenocarcinomas of bad prognosis, in the context of the otherwise established tumor-suppressor role of this gene, or the strictly controlled gene dosage, which could be overridden in these particular cases. One of the first lncRNA genes discovered was MALAT1, the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1,21 later also referred to as NEAT2 for nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2.

56c830635795f9a73e00000e	Which components of the stress granules are known to be related to motor neuron degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?	Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as a key protein in the pathogenesis of some cases of ALS. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients.  in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. These findings demonstrate a potential link between FUS mutations and cellular pathways involved in stress responses that may be relevant to altered motor neuron homeostasis in ALS. both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43. These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms abnormal ubiquitinated and phosphorylated inclusions in brain tissues from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA binding protein, have been associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness and has overlapping clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response. Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder consisting of progressive loss of motor neurons. TDP-43 has been identified as a component of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions of motor neurons in ALS. SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) PTE significantly reduced the incorporation of R521C FUS/TLS into stress granules under stress conditions.

5720a8da0fd6f91b68000010	Which could be some of the possible causes of hypersomnia?	Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In acute TBI, we recently found decreased CSF levels of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter Hypocretin levels 6 months after TBI were significantly lower in patients with post-traumatic EDS These results suggest that sleep-wake disturbances, particularly EDS, fatigue and hypersomnia are common after TBI, and significantly impair quality of life When sleepiness is excessive, undesirable, inappropriate or unexplained, it often indicates a clinical disorder that is generically termed hypersomnia. One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases We report on an 83 yr old man with hypersomnia and central sleep apnoea (CSA) One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea. In this article, the causes of hypersomnia are detailed following the conventional classification of hypersomnic syndromes: narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia, insufficient sleep syndrome, medication- and toxin-dependent sleepiness, hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders, hypersomnia associated with neurological disorders, posttraumatic hypersomnia, infection (with a special emphasis on the differences between bacterial and viral diseases compared with parasitic diseases, such as sleeping sickness) and hypersomnia, hypersomnia associated with metabolic or endocrine diseases, breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep apnea syndromes, and periodic limb movements in sleep. In the absence of sleep deprivation (either because of behavioral or medical causes) or pharmacologically induced sleepiness, hypersomnia is a manifestation of one of the central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, and recurrent hypersomnias such as Kleine-Levin syndrome. Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), narcolepsy, chronic sleep deprivation (insufficiency), and restless legs/periodic limb movements in sleep syndrome (RLS/PLMS) represent the most common causes of hypersomnia. Hypocretin (orexin) deficiency in narcolepsy and primary hypersomnia. One of the leading causes of hypersomnia is sleep apnea.	[['traumatic brain injury (TBI)'], ['sleep apnea'], ['dementia']]
531375a6e3eabad021000011	which are the risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and can detect myocardial replacement fibrosis (anindependent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes) using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).  J wave is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The J wave may be a risk factor for SCA in patients with HCM. Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was the most common risk factor present (alone or in combination with other markers) in patients experiencing primary prevention interventions (17 of 26 [65%]). Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy was most frequently associated with appropriate interventions. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that LGE has incremental value in addition to clinical risk factors for risk stratification and management of patients with HC. Fibrosis as detected by CMR should be evaluated as an additional risk factor to further delineate risk of SCD in carriers of an HCM causing mutation. Nonsustained VT was the only predictive risk factor (RF) for an appropriate ICD intervention in the PP (positive predictive value 22%, negative predictive value 96%). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia seems to be the most predictive RF for appropriate device discharges.  However, LGE was strongly associated with surrogates of arrhythmia and remained a significant associate of subsequent SCD and/or ICD discharge after controlling for other variables. If replicated, LGE may be considered an important risk factor for sudden death in patients with HCM. In conclusion, our cohort study results do not support LVOTO as an independent risk factor for SD in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The appearance of a "hump" at the ST segment during exercise testing appears to be a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM. However, further studies are necessary to validate this finding in larger populations and to elucidate the mechanism of the appearance of the "hump." The ICD is definitely indicated for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients with HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest with documented ventricular fibrillation, or experienced one or more episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. A number of risk markers are used to assess the magnitude of risk, including family history of premature sudden death; extreme left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (> 30 mm) in young patients; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter electrocardiographic recording; unexplained (not neurally mediated) syncope, particularly in young patients; and blood pressure decrease or inadequate increase during upright exercise. Measured risk factors for sudden death included family history of sudden death, massive left ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, and unexplained prior syncope. The following risk factors were analyzed: 1) previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 2) family history of sudden cardiac death; 3) high-risk genetic mutations; 4) syncope; 5) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 6) hypotensive response to exercise; and 7) marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Family history of sudden death was associated with a positive predictive value of 25% for appropriate therapies, 40% for syncope and 50% for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value.  It is concluded that there is an association of the mutation Arg719Trp in the beta-myosin heavy chain with sudden cardiac death in a young child.

531b3ff3b166e2b80600003d	Which proteins are related to the loss of cell-cell adhesion during EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)?	conserved polarity proteins Par6 and aPKC regulate cell polarization processes  In addition to signaling pathways that alter genetic programes that trigger the loss of cell-cell adhesion, alternative pathways can alter cell plasticity to regulate cell-cell cohesion and increase invasive potential One such pathway involves TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Par6 Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT Numb has been shown to play an important role in the proper functions of Par protein complex and in cell-cell junctions, both of which are associated with EMT Recently, we showed that Numb is capable of binding to both Par3 and E-cadherin Knockdown of Numb by shRNA in MDCK cells led to a lateral to apical translocation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, active F-actin polymerization, mis-localization of Par3 and aPKC, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and an increase in cell migration and proliferation This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1. EGF induces EMT in the breast cancer cell line PMC42-LA and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (ST) induces EMT in embryonic neural epithelial cells, with F-actin de-bundling and disruption of cell-cell adhesion, via inhibition of aPKC ST in combination with EGF directed a greater EMT via actin depolymerisation and focal contact size reduction, resulting in a loosening of cell-ECM attachment along with Snail1-Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by several inducers of EMT, in particular the ZEB and Snail factors, downregulate the expression and/or functional organization of core polarity complexes TGFbeta has pleiotropic effects that range from regulation of proliferation and apoptosis to morphological changes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) Morphological changes were accompanied by decrease in E-cadherin and increased Snail expression but the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, SMAalpha and Vimentin) studied remained unchanged Neutralising E-cadherin function promoted the invasion and inhibited the aggregation of endocrine-sensitive MCF7 cells, whilst having little effect on the behaviour of TamR cells	[['ZEB'], ['SNAIL'], ['SIRT1'], ['EGF'], ['TGFb'], ['aPKC'], ['Par6']]

5717ab7ccb4ef8864c00000c	Which are the main functions of G3BP1 and G3BP2 proteins?	Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 are required for translation of interferon stimulated mRNAs and are targeted by a dengue virus non-coding RNA We examined three conserved host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 in dengue virus (DENV-2) infection and found them to be novel regulators of the interferon (IFN) response against DENV-2 Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number like G3BP1, the overexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli Collectively, these results suggest that both G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a role in the formation of SGs in various human cells and thereby recovery from these cellular stresses Regulation of PMP22 mRNA by G3BP1 affects cell proliferation in breast cancer cells G3BP has been reported to both stabilize and induce degradation of specific mRNAs Global gene expression analyses of G3BP1- and G3BP2-depleted cells indicate that primarily G3BP1, and much less G3BP2, influences mRNA expression levels. Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) was one gene that was significantly influenced by G3BP1 depletion which led to a 2-3 fold increased expression Depletion of PMP22 resulted in increased proliferation and the G3BP1-mediated effect on proliferation was not seen upon PMP22-depletion Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are overexpressed in various human tumors and participate in several signaling pathways involved in growth, differentiation and apoptosis Two related proteins found in association with nsP4 at both times of infection, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and G3BP2 were also previously identified as associated with SINV nsP2 and nsP3. We demonstrate a likely overlapping role for these host factors in limiting SINV replication events Modulation of p53 and MDM2 activity by novel interaction with Ras-GAP binding proteins (G3BP) we have found that members of the Ras network of proteins, Ras-GTPase activating protein-SH3-domain-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and 2), bind to p53 in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that expression of G3BPs leads to the redistribution of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The G3BP2 isoform additionally associated with murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53. G3BP2 expression resulted in significant reduction in MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and degradation. Interestingly, MDM2 was also stabilized in G3BP2-expressing cells and its ability to ubiquitylate itself was compromised We identified several proteins, including DDX6, G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1, and USP10, implicated in P body (PB) and stress granule (SG) function, and not previously known to bind DENV RNAs. Additional experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to DDX6, the SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1 and USP10 bind to the variable region (VR) in the 3' UTR. G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 are required for translation of interferon stimulated mRNAs and are targeted by a dengue virus non-coding RNA. Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number.  Collectively, these results suggest that both G3BP1 and G3BP2 play a role in the formation of SGs in various human cells and thereby recovery from these cellular stresses. Furthermore, expression of shRNA targeting either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in human cancer cell lines resulted in marked upregulation of p53 levels and activity.  Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a component of SGs that initiates the assembly of SGs by forming a multimer. Although single knockdown of either G3BP1 or G3BP2 in 293T cells partially reduced the number of SG-positive cells induced by arsenite, the knockdowns of both genes significantly reduced the number. Moreover, like G3BP1, the overexpression of G3BP2 induced SGs even without stress stimuli. We found that HDAC6 interacts with another SG protein, G3BP (Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1), and localizes to SGs under all stress conditions tested. Dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly re-emerging flavivirus that causes dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), diseases for which there are no available therapies or vaccines.  The DENV-2 positive-strand RNA genome contains 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that have been shown to form secondary structures required for virus replication and interaction with host cell proteins.  In order to comprehensively identify host cell factors that bind the DENV-2 UTRs, we performed RNA chromatography, using the DENV-2 5' and 3' UTRs as "bait", combined with quantitative mass spectrometry.  We identified several proteins, including DDX6, G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1, and USP10, implicated in P body (PB) and stress granule (SG) function, and not previously known to bind DENV RNAs.  Additional experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to DDX6, the SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, Caprin1 and USP10 bind to the variable region (VR) in the 3' UTR.

56c6dc6f5795f9a73e000007	Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of facultative heterochromatin?	We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing ("ChIP-seq") of DNA associated with the centromere-specific histone H3, CENP-A (CenH3), to identify centromeric DNA, and ChIP-seq with antibodies against dimethylated H3K4, trimethylated H3K9 and trimethylated H3K27 to determine the relative distribution and proportion of euchromatin, obligate and facultative heterochromatin, respectively Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin. In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. Remarkably, H3K9me3 is predominant in coding regions of active genes, a phenomenon that is not restricted to the X chromosome. We detected the H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 modifications, with H3K27me3, which is indicative of facultative heterochromatin, exhibiting the highest enrichment on all viral promoters tested.  Our study identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells.

Members of the Betaproteobacteria (i.e. Dechloromonas, Ralstonia, Rhodoferax, Polaromonas, Delftia, Chromobacterium) and the Firmicutes dominated the biostimulated aquifer community. Shewanella oneidensis is an important model organism for bioremediation studies because of its diverse respiratory capabilities, conferred in part by multicomponent, branched electron transport systems. metal-reducing Geobacter species  Identifications based on bacterial 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the dominant cultivable bacteria belonged to the genus Bacillus. Members of the genera Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Klebsiella, Microbacterium and Chryseobacterium were also isolated from the LAAs soil samples.  Geobacter Geobacteraceae Geobacteraceae will be responsible for much of the Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction during uranium bioremediation in these sediments.  Our previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial communities involved in uranium bioremediation and energy harvesting are both dominated by microorganisms in the family Geobacteraceae and that the organisms in this family are responsible for uranium bioremediation and electron transfer to electrodes.  the organisms in the family Geobacteraceae that have been found to be associated with metal reduction in previous studies  to stimulate the activity of Geobacter species during in situ uranium bioremediation.

Geobacter uraniireducens sp. nov., isolated from subsurface sediment undergoing uranium bioremediation. A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterium, strain Rf4T, which conserves energy from dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction concomitant with acetate oxidation, was isolated from subsurface sediment undergoing uranium bioremediation.  . Constant levels of Geobacter ompB transcripts were detected in groundwater during a field experiment in which acetate was added to the subsurface to promote in situ uranium bioremediation.  Geobacter species are the predominant organisms,  Firmicutes were the predominant organisms whereas no Firmicutes sequences were detected in background sediments which did not have the capacity to sorb U(VI), Geobacter species that predominates during in situ uranium bioremediation at this site.

5173eb428ed59a060a000021	What type of cancers and inherited diseases have been associated to mutations in the Notch pathway?	Comparative functional genomic analysis identified a signature of Notch activation in 30% of HCC samples from patients. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. We found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human cancers. We detected Notch1 missense mutations in 8.3% of the tumors (only in the posterior fossa location and in case of 9q33-34 gain). Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). Here, we demonstrate that endothelial-specific deletion of Jag1 leads to cardiovascular defects in both embryonic and adult mice that are reminiscent of those in Alagille syndrome. In this study, analysis of 21 Vietnamese ALGS individuals led to the identification of 19 different mutations (18 JAG1 and 1 NOTCH2), 17 of which are novel, including the third reported NOTCH2 mutation in Alagille Syndrome. Genetics of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation of the developing human forebrain, is due to multiple genetic defects. Most genes that have been implicated in HPE belong to the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Here we describe a new candidate gene isolated from array comparative genomic hybridization redundant 6qter deletions, DELTA Like 1 (DLL1), which is a ligand of NOTCH. Four genes causing a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease have been identified: DLL3 (SCDO1: MIM 277300), MESP2 (SCDO2: MIM 608681), LFNG (SCDO3: MIM609813) and HES7 (SCDO4). These genes are all essential components of the Notch signalling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Previously, only a single SCD-causative missense mutation was described in HES7. In this study, we have identified two new missense mutations in the HES7 gene in a single family, Here we have used autozygosity mapping to identify a mutation in a fourth Notch pathway gene, Hairy-and-Enhancer-of-Split-7 (HES7), in an autosomal recessive SCD family. Alagille syndrome (AGS) is caused by mutations in the gene for the Notch signaling pathway ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), which are found in 94% of patients. To identify the cause of disease in patients without JAG1 mutations, we screened 11 JAG1 mutation-negative probands with AGS for alterations in the gene for the Notch2 receptor (NOTCH2). We found NOTCH2 mutations segregating in two families and identified five affected individuals. Mutations in the JAG1 (Jagged 1) gene, coding a ligand in the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway, are responsible for AGS. Here we present sixteen different JAG1 gene mutations, among them twelve novel, not described previously. Altogether 226 different JAG1 mutations have been described in association with AGS, including our novel 36 mutations. Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of JAG1 mutations result in AGS. These include total gene deletions, protein truncating, splicing and missense mutations which are distributed across the coding region of the gene. Here we present results of JAG1 mutation screening by SSCP and FISH in 105 patients with AGS. For these studies, new primers were designed for 12 exons. Mutations were identified in 63/105 patients (60%) We have screened 54 AGS probands and family members to determine the frequency of mutations in JAG1. Three patients (6%) had deletions of the entire gene. Of the remaining 51 patients, 35 (69%) had mutations within JAG1, identified by SSCP analysis. Of the 35 identified intragenic mutations, all were unique, with the exceptions of a 5-bp deletion in exon 16, seen in two unrelated patients, and a C insertion at base 1618 in exon 9, also seen in two unrelated patients. Analyses of many patients with cytogenetic deletions or rearrangements have mapped the gene to chromosome 20p12, although deletions are found in a relatively small proportion of patients (< 7%). We have mapped the human Jagged1 gene (JAG1), encoding a ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, to the Alagille syndrome critical region within 20p12.

51bdb644047fa84d1d000001	Which are the known human transmembrane nucleoporins?	We investigated the interplay between import receptors and the transmembrane nucleoporin Pom121 the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. The transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1 NDC1 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that is required for NPC assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The only protein known to localize to and be important in the assembly of both of these yeast structures is the integral membrane protein, Ndc1p. However, no homologues of Ndc1p had been characterized in metazoa. Here, we identify and analyze NDC1 homologues that are conserved throughout evolution. We show that the overall topology of these homologues is conserved. Each contains six transmembrane segments in its N-terminal half and has a large soluble C-terminal half of approximately 300 amino acids. Although it is not known whether vertebrate NDC1 protein localizes to nuclear pores like its yeast counterpart, the human homologue contains three FG repeats in the C-terminus, a feature of many nuclear pore proteins. we bring together data from another study to demonstrate that the human homologue of NDC1 is the known inner nuclear membrane protein, NET3. The conserved transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1 we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans gp210 is a major constituent of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) with possible structural and regulatory roles. It interacts with components of the NPC via its C-terminal domain (CTD), which follows a transmembrane domain and a massive ( approximately 200 kDa) N-terminal region that resides in the lumen of the perinuclear space. The membrane-spanning glycoprotein gp210 is a major component of the nuclear pore complex. This nucleoporin contains a large cisternal N-terminal domain, a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and a single transmembrane segment. We propose that gp210 is organized into the pore membrane as a large array of gp210 dimers that may constitute a luminal submembranous protein skeleton. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently produce autoantibodies against gp210, an integral glycoprotein of the nuclear pores. this protein consists of three main domains: a large glycosylated lumenal domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis frequently develop autoantibodies directed to gp210, a major glycoprotein of the nuclear pore complex. This protein contains a large glycosylated cisternal domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis recognize a restricted region within the cytoplasmic tail of nuclear pore membrane glycoprotein Gp210 Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently have autoantibodies against a 210-kD integral glycoprotein of the nuclear envelope pore membrane. This protein, termed gp210, has a 1,783-amino acid amino-terminal domain located in the perinuclear space, a 20-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 58-amino acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail. We investigated the interplay between import receptors and the transmembrane nucleoporin Pom121. Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Here, we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans. Here, we report the solution structure of the human gp210 CTD as determined by various spectroscopic techniques. Using human gp210 isolated from HeLa cells we found the lumenal domain as the major target. This protein, termed gp210, has a 1,783-amino acid amino-terminal domain located in the perinuclear space, a 20-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 58-amino acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail.  In vertebrate cells, GLYCOPROTEIN OF 210 kD (gp210), PORE MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF 121 kD (Pom121), and NUCLEAR DIVISION CYCLE1 (NDC1) have been identified as integral pore membrane proteins (Cronshaw et al., 2002).

Abnormal hypermethylation in CpG island of hepaCAM promoter is involved in absence of hepaCAM gene expression when bladder cancer occurs. Methylated RARβ(2) and APC were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients (62.8%, 59.5%) than benign (16.4%, 5%) but not detected in healthy volunteers (0%) at (P < 0.0001). Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73.4%) showed methylated RARβ(2) and 86 (67.2%) showed methylated APC. Thus, methylated RARβ(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer. Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells. hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells. Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of hepaCAM gene was reversed and expression of its mRNA and protein were re-activated in two cell lines by DNA methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-CdR	[['hepaCAM (hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule)'], ['RARβ(2)'], ['APC'], ['TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain)'], ['RASSF1A'], ['p14(ARF)'], ['p16']]
51740da48ed59a060a000024	Which are the bioinformatics tools for gene structure prediction? 	The prediction of the complete structure of genes is one of the very important tasks of bioinformatics, especially in eukaryotes. A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence. This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into 'exon-intron' (EI), 'intron-exon' (IE) or 'None' (N) boundary classes. The proposed WPSS method poses efficient results compared with the performance of many methods proposed in the literature. SCGPred: a score-based method for gene structure prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Moreover, computational gene finding in newly sequenced genomes is especially a difficult task due to the absence of a training set of abundant validated genes. Here we present a new gene-finding program, SCGPred, to improve the accuracy of prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Therefore, SCG-Pred can serve as an alternative gene-finding tool for newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes. The program is freely available at http://bio.scu.edu.cn/SCGPred/. Incorporation of splice site probability models for non-canonical introns improves gene structure prediction in plants. We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy. Source code for the updated versions of GeneSeqer and SplicePredictor (distributed with the GeneSeqer code) isavailable at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/bioinformatics2go/gs/download.html. Web servers for Arabidopsis, rice and other plant species are accessible at http://www.plantgdb.org/PlantGDB-cgi/GeneSeqer/AtGDBgs.cgi, http://www.plantgdb.org/PlantGDB-cgi/GeneSeqer/OsGDBgs.cgi and http://www.plantgdb.org/PlantGDB-cgi/GeneSeqer/PlantGDBgs.cgi, respectively.

Software to generate training data and parameterizations for Bayesian splice site models is available at http://gremlin1.gdcb.iastate.edu/~volker/SB05B/BSSM4GSQ/ Prediction of splice sites with dependency graphs and their expanded bayesian networks. A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the precise exon-intron boundaries, i.e. the splice sites, in the coding region. Software (a program called DGSplicer) and datasets used are available at http://csrl.ee.nthu.edu.tw/bioinf/ BACKGROUND: cclu@ee.nthu.edu.tw. Gene structure prediction from consensus spliced alignment of multiple ESTs matching the same genomic locus. Accurate gene structure annotation is a challenging computational problem in genomics. The splice site prediction tool (SplicePredictor) is distributed with the GeneSeqer code. A SplicePredictor web server is available at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/sp.cgi We have developed a software tool, Transcript Assembly Program (TAP), to delineate gene structures using genomically aligned EST sequences. GeneBuilder: interactive in silico prediction of gene structure. In the case of low homology, GeneBuilder is still able to predict the gene structure. The GeneBuilder system has been tested by using the standard set (Burset and Guigo, Genomics, 34, 353-367, 1996) and the performances are: 0.89 sensitivity and 0.91 specificity at the nucleotide level. The computer program SeqHelp organizes information from database searches, gene structure prediction, and other information to generate multiply aligned, hypertext-linked reports to allow for fast analysis of molecular sequences. Identification of human gene structure using linear discriminant functions and dynamic programming. Development of advanced technique to identify gene structure is one of the main challenges of the Human Genome Project. A gene structure prediction system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition functions. Analysis of uncharacterized human sequences based on our methods for splice site (HSPL, RNASPL), internal exons (HEXON), all type of exons (FEXH) and human (FGENEH) and bacterial (CDSB) gene structure prediction and recognition of human and bacterial sequences (HBR) (to test a library for E. coli contamination) is available through the University of Houston, Weizmann Institute of Science network server and a WWW page of the Human Genome Center at Baylor College of Medicine. In the bioinformatics field, many computer algorithmic and data mining technologies have been developed for gene prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, sequence analysis, and protein folding predictions, to name a few. The accurate prediction of intron boundaries largely facilitates the correct prediction of gene structure in nuclear genomes.

Selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) generates the selenium donor for selenocysteine biosynthesis in eubacteria. One homologue of SelD in eukaryotes is SPS1 (selenophosphate synthetase 1) and a second one, SPS2, was identified as a selenoprotein in mammals.

552435602c8b63434a000009	Which genes/proteins have been found to inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)?	Interestingly, the Cdk inhibitor p18(Ink4c) was induced in the transgenic pineal glands independently of p53, and transgenic mice that lacked Ink4c developed invasive PNET, although at an older age than those lacking p53. Our finding that the Cdk4 inhibitor p18(Ink4c) is a tumor suppressor in cyclin D1-driven PNET suggests that pharmacologic interventions to inhibit Cdk4 activity may be a useful chemoprevention or therapeutic strategy in cancer driven by primary RB pathway disruption. Our previous studies showed that while both specific CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4A (P16) and gankyrin bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in similar fashion, only P16 inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4. Recent biological studies of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 have proposed that p21 C-terminal domain (p21(CT)) plays a key role as a potent Cdk4 inhibitor.  Especially, our data suggests that the D(149)FYHSKRR(156) region of p21 is critical for Cdk4 binding, indicating that the major driving force for complex originates from hydrophobic interaction between p21 and Cdk4. We show that c-Myc prevents induction of the cdk4 inhibitor p15(Ink4b) and the subsequent inhibition of G(1) cdks by TGF-beta. CDK activity is modulated by inhibitors such as p15INK4b and p16INK4a. Loss of function of p15INK4b and p16INK4a (multiple tumor suppressor-I and CDK4 inhibitor) determines impairment in the control of the cell cycle and contributes to the transformation of several cell types.  D-type cyclins, in association with the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In the present study, we analyzed human ovarian carcinoma cell lines for abnormalities in the tumor suppressor gene Rb (retinoblastoma) and in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor genes (p16INK4 and p15INK4B) using molecular biology techniques. These data suggest that abnormalities of Rb and CDK4 inhibitor genes (p16INK4, p15INK4B) may be involved in human ovarian carcinogenesis. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1.  The p15 and p16 CDK4 inhibitor genes map within the chromosome band 9p21 region deleted frequently in malignant mesothelioma and other cancers. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) inhibitor (p16INK4/MTS1/CDKN2) gene has been recently identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of the high frequency of homozygous deletion observed in numerous human tumor cell lines, including leukemias.  The identification of a cdk4 inhibitor, p16INK4, as a target for mutations in cultured tumor lines and primary tumors suggested that RB activity may be affected in these cells. Roles of cyclin A-Cdk2 as a p27 target and cyclin D2-Cdk4 as a p27 reservoir may result from the differential ability of bound p27 to inhibit the kinase subunit in these complexes. Role of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor gene family p15, p16, p18 and p19 in leukemia and lymphoma. Identification of functional elements of p18INK4C essential for binding and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6. One of the INK4 molecules, p16, is also known as multiple tumor suppressor and has been found to be mutated or deleted in various tumors and cell lines. We have previously identified p18 as a member of the INK4 family. Members of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors specifically bind and inhibit the G1-specific CDK molecules CDK4 and CDK6. The subcellular locations of p15(Ink4b) and p27(Kip1) coordinate their inhibitory interactions with cdk4 and cdk2.

54f21b69c409818c32000007	Which disorders are associated to mutated Hepcidin (HAMP)?	juvenile hemochromatosis due to hemojuvelin and hepcidin mutation  Mutations in all of the currently known genes implicated in non-HFE HH (hemojuvelin, hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, and ferroportin) have been reported in patients from the Asia-Pacific region.  In conclusion, HAMP and hemojuvelin mutations are rare among Spanish HH patients, and their impact in this population is not significant. Juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is the most severe form, usually caused by mutations in hemojuvelin (HJV) or hepcidin (HAMP).  We have identified novel mutations in HJV, HAMP, and SLC40A1 in countries not normally associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Thailand). In humans, loss of TfR2, HJV, and hepcidin itself or FPN mutations result in full-blown hemochromatosis.  Targeting hepcidin with replacement therapy to decrease iron may be a treatment of not only HCV, HH, and alcoholic cirrhosis, but also PCT. Hepcidin deficiency underlies iron overload in HFE-hemochromatosis as well as in several other genetic iron excess disorders, such as hemojuvelin or hepcidin-related hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor 2-related hemochromatosis.  In addition to HFE gene, mutations in the genes that encode hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1) have been associated with regulation of iron homeostasis and development of HH	[['juvenile hemochromatosis']]
52e203bc98d0239505000011	Which are the most under-represented oligonucleotides in higher eukaryote genomes?	Unusual frequencies of certain alternating purine-pyrimidine runs in natural DNA sequences Octanucleotides are the most deficient, occurring at only 60% of the frequency expected in random sequences. An unexpectedly high proportion of these octamers consists of alternating tetramers with the repeat structure (PuPyPuPy)2 or (PyPuPyPu)2 For dinucleotides, TA is almost universally under-represented, with the exception of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, and CG is strongly under-represented in vertebrates and in mitochondrial genomes For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences The dinucleotide CpG is significantly under-represented in vertebrate DNA and is usually methylated One such pattern recognition system is based on unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in particular sequence contexts (CpG motifs); these motifs are common in bacterial DNA but are under-represented ("CpG suppression") and methylated in vertebrate DNA We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context--which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans--is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes	[['TA'], ['CG'], ['(PuPy)n'], ['GCA/TGC'], ['CTA/TAG']]
515df86a298dcd4e5100002e	List co-morbidities that may occur together with "Stiff man Syndrome"	To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves' disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature. This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves' disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with immunosuppressive therapy. HCV may be the etiologic virus of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity; a rare disorder similar to stiff-man syndrome although different because it is progressive and fatal. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS. GAD has been suggested as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). GAD-65 is a dominant autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An elderly man with progressive dementia and concomitant development of stiff-man syndrome is described. He had not had stiff-man syndrome one year earlier, when he had only mild dementia. An association between stiff-man syndrome and dementia has not been previously described. It is possible that this patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia.

5322d3cb9b2d7acc7e000010	Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?	Inhibition of HDAC6 deacetylase activity increases its binding with microtubules and suppresses microtubule dynamic instability in MCF-7 cells HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions. Moreover, acetylation of α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). MEC-17 deficiency leads to reduced α-tubulin acetylation and impaired migration of cortical neurons MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different species in vivo. Thus, MEC-17, which regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, appears to control the migration and morphological transition of cortical neurons. This finding reveals the importance of MEC-17 and α-tubulin acetylation in cortical development. NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an α-tubulin deacetylase. Moreover, α-tubulin acetylation levels of microtubules specifically extending into the terminal synaptic boutons are reduced in response to dTip60 HAT reduction. In this study, angiotensin II induced disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using RNA interference. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced vascular remodeling. Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic microtubule dynamics can be explained by impaired histone deacetylase 6 function Addition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold). Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules. We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells. The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform. Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration. Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin	[['MEC-17'], ['SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2)'], ['HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6)'], ['dTip60']]

Imatinib can decrease tumor size preoperatively and help to improve postsurgical aesthetic appearance and minimize functional impairment. for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Treatment with adjuvant imatinib following surgical resection of localized Kit-positive GIST, the most recent FDA-approved indication (December 2008), has been shown to significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with surgical resection alone Currently, there are no clinical recommendations regarding how to incorporate imatinib drug plasma monitoring in patients with either chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors, indications for which imatinib is approved. Imatinib was effective against GIST that were positive for KIT protein The introduction of alternative therapies, such as imatinib for CML, has challenged well-established indications. More micro-GIST are discovered with the development of investigations, rising the question of wait and see policy for some of them. In locally advanced inoperable patients and metastatic patients, Imatinib is the standard treatment. The introduction of alternative therapies has challenged well-established indications such as imatinib for chronic myeloid leukaemia.

APOBEC3 proteins inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition in the absence of ORF1p binding.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n/(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9ORF72 gene Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological change in a variety of heart diseases contributing to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. Up-regulating relaxin expression by G-quadruplex interactive ligand to achieve antifibrotic action Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin. We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the first cleavage step in the proteolysis of the APP to the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a process involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease Anti-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein APP by α-secretase prevents formation of the amyloid-β peptide, which accumulates in senile plaques of Alzheimer disease patients. α-Secretase belongs to the family of a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs), and ADAM10 is the primary candidate for this anti-amyloidogenic activity Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a G-rich region between nucleotides 66 and 94 of the ADAM10 5'-UTR forms a highly stable, intramolecular, parallel G-quadruplex secondary structure under physiological conditions FANCJ helicase defective in Fanconia anemia and breast cancer unwinds G-quadruplex DNA to defend genomic stability. Telomerase inhibition with a novel G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin: in vitro and in vivo studies in acute leukemia Recently, we have demonstrated that treatment with a G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in the BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines A G-quadruplex-interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), induces telomere shortening with apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia We examined G-quadruplex interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), for its ability to inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia cells, including freshly obtained leukemia cells.

52bf1cb303868f1b0600000b	What hand deformities do patients with Apert syndrome present with?	Five patients, ranging from Upton type 1 to type 3 Apert hand deformities, have had preoperative computed tomography angiography that delineated the vascular anatomy. This allowed planning and execution of a single-stage syndactyly release in all patients. The protocol presented allows preoperative planning and single-stage operation for complete release of syndactyly in patients with Apert syndrome. In patients with Apert syndrome, the hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures. These include a short thumb with radial clinodactyly, complex syndactyly with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, symphalangism and simple syndactyly of the fourth web space. The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions and the neurovascular bundles.  Two of the patients had Apert syndrome (syndromic craniosynostosis with symmetrical syndactyly) and two had polydactyly.  The overall strategy involved early bilateral separation of syndactylous border digits at 1 year of age, followed by sequential unilateral middle syndactyly mass separation with thumb osteotomy and bone grafting as needed. In these 10 patients, a total of 53 web spaces were released, 49 of which involved osteotomies for complex syndactyly.  Apert syndrome, characterised by craniosynostosis, craniofacial anomalies, and symmetrical syndactyly of the digits (cutaneous and bony fusion), has been associated with two canonical mutations in the FGFR2 gene (S252W, P253R) in the great majority of cases.  The Apert syndrome hand demonstrates many typical clinical features including syndactyly, symbrachyphalangism, and growth disturbances. In Apert syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals.  urgical correction of syndactyly of the Apert hand should begin by 6 months and be completed by 3 years of age. As much surgery as possible is carried out at each sitting.  The syndactyly cases were more complicated than the average, among them 4 cases of Apert syndrome were noted.

5539029cbc4f83e828000012	Which genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development?	Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups. Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1 and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotype Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation PCDH10 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene in medulloblastoma The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progression We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were associated with significantly decreased patient survival Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's expression and survival in children with medulloblastoma Bmi1 is required for Hedgehog pathway-driven medulloblastoma expansion These data provide the first demonstration that Bmi1 is required for spontaneous de novo development of a solid tumor arising in the brain, suggest a crucial role for Bmi1-dependent, nestin-expressing progenitor cells in medulloblastoma expansion, and implicate Bmi1 as a key factor required for Hh pathway-driven tumorigenesis Genomic amplification of orthodenticle homologue 2 in medulloblastomas Genomic alterations normally associated with medulloblastomas, including MYC amplification and isochromosome 17q, were easily detected. Surprisingly, analysis of only five genomes revealed novel amplicons on chromosome 14q, one of which contained the orthodenticle homologue 2 (OTX2) homeobox gene. DNA copy number analysis showed that OTX2 had undergone genomic amplification in 2 of 11 medulloblastoma cell lines and 8 of 42 primary tumors Serial analysis of gene expression of 240 different human tumors or normal tissues revealed that 96% of all 783 OTX2 transcripts sequenced were in medulloblastomas or embryonic stem cells OTX2 functions to specify the fate of neuroectoderm in various regions of the developing brain. This developmental role is consistent with the evidence suggesting that OTX2 is a medulloblastoma oncogene Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella) In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum These data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis Biallelic epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma development Seventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG island Hypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine Epigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma RASSF1A hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological variants and age and sex groupings Medulloblastoma, a brain tumor, develops in about 3% of NBCCS patients, and mutations in PTCH have also been described in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomas Recently, a transgenic mouse hemizygous for the Ptch gene was generated by homologous recombination. Medulloblastomas were found in about 19% of these mice within the first 25 weeks after birth We also examined the mRNA expression levels for the remaining Ptch allele, as well as for Gli1, a gene known to be transcriptionally activated by Ptch inactivation. Blot analysis of RNA from the 13 tumors shows that Ptch mRNA of appropriate size is expressed in all tumors at varying levels. Expression of Gli1 was increased in tumors compared to normal cerebellum. These results suggest that deletion of one copy of Ptch may be sufficient to promote medulloblastoma development in mice	[['PTCH1'], ['SUFU'], ['PTEN'], ['CREBBP'], ['PTEN'], ['MYT1L'], ['NFIA'], ['NFIB'], ['TEAD1'], ['TGIF2'], ['IGF2'], ['PCDH10'], ['BMI1'], ['MYC'], ['OTX2'], ['RASSF1A'], ['HIC1'], ['CASP8']]
5300aad02059c6d71c000080	Which sports have a risk for commotio cordis?	This study sought to characterize the demographics of commotio cordis globally in comparison to the U.S. experience. Not unexpectedly, the groups differed with baseball/softball and football predominant in the United States (55% of events) and soccer, cricket, and hockey most common internationally (47% of events).  The authors reviewed 41 incidents of baseball injuries reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research from 1982 until 2002. Catastrophic injuries included 23 severe head injuries, 8 cervical injuries, 3 cases of commotio cordis, and 2 cases each of a collapsed trachea and facial fractures. Commotio cordis events occurred most commonly during organized sporting events (79 [62%]), such as baseball, but 49 (38%) occurred as part of daily routine and recreational activities. Twenty-two (28%) participants were wearing commercially available chest barriers, including 7 in whom the projectile made direct contact with protective padding (baseball catchers and lacrosse/hockey goalies), and 2 in whom the projectile was a baseball specifically designed to reduce risk. In a recent study of fatal chest impacts by baseballs, 28% of the children were wearing a chest protector. This study evaluates the effectiveness of chest protectors in reducing the risk of commotio cordis.  It has been described after blows to the chest from baseballs, softballs, hockey pucks, and other objects. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Several measures, such as the use of safety baseballs and the use of chest protectors, can help protect young athletes from commotio cordis.

55181d1e6487737b43000008	What are the breath test biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO), a key macrophage antimycobacterial mediator that ameliorates immunopathology, is measurable in exhaled breath in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis.  CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, impaired pulmonary NO bioavailability is associated with more-severe disease and delayed mycobacterial clearance. Four KI windows corresponded with KI values of VOCs previously identified as biomarkers of pulmonary TB and metabolic products of M. tuberculosis, principally derivatives of naphthalene, benzene and alkanes.  Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide as a potential screening tool for pulmonary tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: While eNO measurement has limited value in the direct diagnosis of pulmonary TB, it may be worth developing and evaluating as a cost-effective replacement of chest X-ray in screening algorithms of pulmonary TB where X-ray is not available. 13[C]-urea breath test as a novel point-of-care biomarker for tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response.  RESULTS: Breath VOCs contained apparent biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis comprising oxidative stress products (alkanes and alkane derivatives) and volatile metabolites of M. tuberculosis (cyclohexane and benzene derivatives). Pulmonary tuberculosis may alter volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath because Mycobacteria and oxidative stress resulting from Mycobacterial infection both generate distinctive VOCs.  We conclude that volatile biomarkers in breath were sensitive and specific for pulmonary tuberculosis: the breath test distinguished between "sick versus well" i.e. between normal controls and patients hospitalized for suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis, and between infected versus non-infected patients i.e. between those whose sputum cultures were positive or negative for Mycobacteria. RESULTS: The concentrations of H202 and TBARs (1022.96+/-186.02 nM and 4.22+/-0. 80 microM, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis as compared with the controls (398.15+/-37.10 nM and 0.48+/-0.17 microM, respectively).  We conclude that volatile biomarkers in breath were sensitive and specific for pulmonary tuberculosis: the breath test distinguished between "sick versus well" i. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath may contain biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis derived from the infectious organism (metabolites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and from the infected host (products of oxidative stress). Volatile biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis in the breath. Breath VOCs contained apparent biomarkers of active pulmonary tuberculosis comprising oxidative stress products (alkanes and alkane derivatives) and volatile metabolites of M.

Of the substitutions, a G.C-->A.T transition including a tandem (CC-->TT) mutation was mainly observed. 2-OH-dATP elicits G.C-->T.A transversions the alpha subunit incorporated 2-OH-dATP 10 times more frequently opposite T than opposite G. 2-OH-dATP elicited G-->T transversions, indicating the formation of G*2-OH-dATP pairs. Interestingly, 2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. The polymerase almost exclusively incorporated 8-hydroxy-dGTP (8-OH-dGTP) opposite template adenine (A) at 60% efficiency of normal dTTP incorporation, and incorporated 2-hydroxy-dATP (2-OH-dATP) opposite template thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C) at substantial rates. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations. Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that the alpha subunit incorporated 2-OH-dATP 10 times more frequently opposite T than opposite G. On the other hand, the incorporation of 2-OH-dATP opposite T by the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment was 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than that opposite G. These results indicate that the misinsertion specificity of 2-OH-dATP differs between replicative and repair-type DNA polymerases, and provide a biochemical basis for the mutations induced by 2-OH-dATP in E. coli. Interestingly, 2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations. On the other hand, in an experiment using the Klenow fragment, incorporation of 2-OH-dATP was observed only opposite T. Steady-state kinetic studies indicated that incorporation of 2-OH-dATP by DNA polymerase alpha opposite T was favored over that opposite C by a factor of only 4.5. 2-OH-dATP induced mutations in a dose-dependent manner and elicited substitution and deletion mutations.

56c1f034ef6e394741000050	List features of the Perry syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Depression, parkinsonism, and hypoventilation (Perry syndrome) or familial motor neuron disease have been linked to mutations in dynactin P150(Glued) (DCTN1). BACKGROUND: Perry syndrome (PS) caused by DCTN1 gene mutation is clinically characterized by autosomal dominant parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss, and hypoventilation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mutations of the DCTN1 gene have been previously associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with Perry syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by weight loss, parkinsonism, central hypoventilation, and psychiatric disturbances.  OBJECTIVES: Perry syndrome consists of autosomal dominant Parkinsonism, depression, weight loss, and central hypoventilation. A patient with a mood disorder and a Parkinsonian syndrome with frontal cognitive impairment thought to resemble progressive supranuclear palsy defied precise diagnosis until the development of respiratory compromise, prompting consideration of the diagnosis of Perry syndrome. Perry syndrome is a familial parkinsonism associated with central hypoventilation, mental depression, and weight loss.  Perry syndrome (PS) caused by DCTN1 gene mutation is clinically characterized by autosomal dominant parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss, and hypoventilation Perry syndrome is a familial parkinsonism associated with central hypoventilation, mental depression, and weight loss Perry syndrome due to the DCTN1 G71R mutation: a distinctive levodopa responsive disorder with behavioral syndrome, vertical gaze palsy, and respiratory failure Perry syndrome consists of early-onset parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss and hypoventilation, with brain pathology characterized by TDP-43 immunostaining. We carried out genome-wide linkage analysis and identified five disease-segregating mutations affecting the CAP-Gly domain of dynactin (encoded by DCTN1) in eight families with Perry syndrome; these mutations diminish microtubule binding and lead to intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Solanezumab's two Phase III trials in AD patients failed to meet endpoints when analyzed independently.  Unfortunately, the first active vaccine (AN1792, consisting of preaggregate Aβ and an immune adjuvant, QS-21) was abandoned because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of treated patients Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being developed. several monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are in clinical trials. These are bapineuzumab, solanezumab, ponezumab, gantenerumab, BAN2401, gammaguard and octagam. Since each antibody has a different antigen epitope of Abeta, anti-amyloid activities are different. Several types of Aβ peptide immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease are under investigation, direct immunization with synthetic intact Aβ(42) , active immunization involving the administration of synthetic fragments of Aβ peptide conjugated to a carrier protein and passive administration with monoclonal antibodies directed against Aβ peptide An active anti-Aβ vaccine preparation, AN1792, has been used in AD patients with some clues of clinical efficacy but causing meningoencephalitis in about 6% of patients and it has been abandoned The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients.  The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab will tell us if passive anti-Aβ immunization is able to alter the course if this devastating disease. Solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to β-amyloid (Aβ), a protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. The drug is currently being investigated in Phase III trials as a disease-modifying treatment for AD.  The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, which is composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies that has been tested in two Phase II trials.

The ability to differentiate between brain tumor progression and radiation therapy induced necrosis is critical for appropriate patient management. I Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis Mass spectrometry based proteomics technologies have allowed for a great progress in identifying disease biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, they face acute challenges from a data reproducibility standpoint, in that no two independent studies have been found to produce the same proteomic patterns. Such reproducibility issues cause the identified biomarker patterns to lose repeatability and prevent real clinical usage. In this work, we propose a profile biomarker approach to overcome this problem from a machine-learning viewpoint by developing a novel derivative component analysis (DCA) In this paper, a random forest classifier (RFC) approach is proposed to diagnose lymph diseases The algorithm provides excellent discrimination of PD patients from PSP patients at an individual level, thus encouraging the application of computer-based diagnosis in clinical practice. The objective of this project was the development and validation of a multiparameter machine learning algorithm and system capable of predicting the need for life-saving interventions (LSIs) in trauma patients.

In Escherichia coli, initial assembly of the Z ring for cell division requires FtsZ plus the essential Z ring-associated proteins FtsA and ZipA. FtsZ is an essential cell division protein in Escherichia coli, and its localization, filamentation, and bundling at the mid-cell are required for Z-ring stability. the bacterial division FtsZ protein The GTPase-dependent polymerization/depolymerization dynamics of FtsZ regulate bacterial cell division in vivo.  Bacterial cytokinesis depends upon the tubulin-like GTPase FtsZ, which polymerizes into an annular structure at midcell (the Z-ring) that defines the division site. FtsZ is the first of the divisome proteins to accumulate at the division site and is widely thought to function as a force generator that constricts the cell envelope.  the cell division protein FtsZ FtsZ, the key protein of bacterial cell division was selected as a potent anti bacterial target.  the cell-division protein FtsZ  FtsZ and PG together function in orchestrating cell division and maintaining cell shape in almost all other bacteria.  the tubulin-like protein of the division septum FtsZ FtsZ is a widely distributed major cytoskeletal protein involved in the archaea and bacteria cell division.  Four major roles of FtsZ have been characterized: cell elongation, GTPase, cell division, and bacterial cytoskeleton.  Bacterial cell division involves a complex and dynamic sequence of events whereby polymers of the protein FtsZ assemble at the division plane and rearrange to achieve the goal of contracting the cell membrane at the site of cell division, thus dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells.  the cell division protein FtsZ FtsZ, the homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is a GTPase that assembles into cytokinetic Z rings essential for cell division in prokaryotic cells	[['cell elongation'], ['GTPase'], ['cell division'], ['bacterial cytoskeleton']]

5321badd9b2d7acc7e00000a	Which types of cancer can be recognized and treated by the use of immunotherapy?	omising expansion of antigen-specific T cells, the clinical responses following vaccination have been limited, indicating that further improvements of DC vaccine potency are necessary. Pre-clinical studies suggest that vaccination with combination of primary DC subsets, such as myeloid and plasmacytoid blood DCs (mDCs and pDCs, respectively), may result in stronger clinical responses. However, it is a challenge to obtain high enough numbers of primary DCs for immunotherapy, since their frequency in blood is very low. We therefore explored the possibility to generate them from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we show that by inhibiting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor with its antagonist StemRegenin 1 (SR1), clinical-scale numbers of functional BDCA2(+)BDCA4(+) pDCs, BDCA1(+) mDCs, and BDCA3(+)DNGR1(+) mDCs can be efficiently generated from human CD34(+) HPCs. The ex vivo-generated DCs were phenotypically and functionally comparable to peripheral blood DCs. They secreted high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers following stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Further, the odent models of prostate cancer have served as valuable preclinical models to evaluate novel treatments and understand malignant disease progression. In particular, a transgenic rat autochthonous model of prostate cancer using the SV40 large T antigen expressed under a prostate-specific probasin promoter was previously developed as a model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (TRAP). In the current report, we backcrossed this strain to the Lewis strain, an inbred rat strain better characterized for immunological analyses. We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age. Tumors were predominantly androgen-dependent, as castration prevented tumor growth in the majority of animals. Finally, we demonstrate that Lew-TRAP rats could be immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding a human prostate tumor antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase) with the development of Lewis strain-specific T-cell responses.

5540eda30083d1bf0e000006	Which proteins constitute the methyl-directed mismatch repair system (MMR) in bacteria?	MutY and MutSL (mismatch repair system [MMR]) Escherichia coli DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein MutS  We have characterized the mismatch repair system (MMR) of the highly radiation-resistant type strain of Deinococcus radiodurans, ATCC 13939. We show that the MMR system is functional in this organism, where it participates in ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and recombination. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. the mutS/L operon essential for methyldirected mismatch repair (MMR) activity The mismatch repair system (mutS, mutL and uvrD genes) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa The mismatch repair system (MMR) recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases caused mainly by DNA polymerase, and contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication in living cells. In Escherichia coli, the MutHLS system is known to function in MMR, and homologues of MutS and MutL are widely conserved in almost all organisms. A simple genetic system has been developed to test the effect of over-expression of wild-type or mutated human MutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) proteins on methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) in Escherichia coli. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria. The methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo, but one of the difficulties in determining the biological relationships between the MMR-related proteins is the tendency of MutL to self-aggregate. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. MutL is required to assist the mismatch repair protein MutS during initiation of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) response in various organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Moreover, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) is known to trigger sensitivity to methylating agents via a mechanism that involves recognition by MutS of the O(6)-mG:T replication intermediates. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. In Escherichia coli, the best studied mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is the methyl-directed long patch repair system which is mediated by three gene products; MutS, MutL and MutH. Cells devoid of MutS1 or MutL proteins were as resistant to gamma-rays, mitomycin C and UV-irradiation as wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the mismatch repair system is not essential for the reconstitution of a functional genome after DNA damage.

5508685b4b2a315d4100000a	List the diseases that can be treated using Vedolizumab.	A new gut-specific monoclonal antibody, vedolizumab, has been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease, and in continued trials no patients have developed PML.  Finally, several studies were presented on new drugs with new therapeutic targets, such as vedolizumab, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.  We review the role of vedolizumab, a humanized antibody against the α4β7 - integrin, in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Results from clinical trials show that vedolizumab is effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in active CD and UC and has a very good safety profile. Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. NCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52.  Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab was more effective than placebo as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis. New and emerging treatments for ulcerative colitis: a focus on vedolizumab.  This article reviews the emerging data on the use of vedolizumab for UC.   Newer treatments such as vedolizumab and tofacitinib may represent valuable future therapies. SUMMARY: New therapeutic targets in IBD patients who failed anti-TNF-α therapy are urgently required, and tofacitinib, vedolizumab and ustekinumab appear to be the most promising drugs.  BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab, a gut-selective, anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody, has shown preliminary efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).  CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks had an adverse event profile similar to that previously observed. Mean disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score) improved with all 3 doses investigated. The new drugs discussed here are those that disturb lymphocyte homing to the gut (natalizumab, vedolizumab and anti-mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule); one that blocks interleukin (IL)-12 as well as the IL-23/T helper 17 (Th17) axis (ustekinumab) and one that blocks the signaling of multiple cytokines (tofacitinib). Vedolizumab  for Crohn's disease. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the potential role of vedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, for the treatment of CD. All randomised placebo-controlled trials that evaluated vedolizumab for the treatment of CD were reviewed and safety and efficacy data evaluated. EXPERT OPINION: Vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated drug that is an important advance for the treatment of CD. Treatment strategies that appear particularly appealing include selective anti-integrin therapy with vedolizumab (anti-α4β7), etrolizumab (anti-β7 antibody) and PF-00547,659 (anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody), anti-interleukin 12/23p40 therapy with ustekinumab and Janus kinase 1, 2 and 3 inhibition with toafacitinib. We discuss a number of them with specific focus on vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha4beta7 integrin on lymphocytes, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, and tofacitinib, a small molecule targeting Janus-activated kinase. Most likely, these three agents will find their way to the market and offer significant therapeutic alternatives for the management of Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis. Natalizumab, vedolizumab, alicaforsen AJM300, rhuMAb β7, CCX282-B, and PF-00547,659 are few of monoclonal antibodies that have shown high promise in trials with the potential for more attractive benefit:risk ratio than currently available therapies. Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we discuss the current treatment options available for patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the history of CAM inhibitors, the current state of development of vedolizumab and its future role in inflammatory bowel disease, if approved by regulatory agencies. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. Several antibodies exist which constitute selection adhesion molecule inhibitors, including Natalizumab, MLN-0002 (Vedolizumab) and ISIS 2302 (Alicaforsen) will be discussed in this review. Vedolizumab for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled phase 2 dose-ranging study. BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic that has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). They are anti CD4+ T cell cytokine including interleukin (IL)-12/23 and IL-17 blockers, selective anti-adhesion molecule known as natalizumab, vedolizumab and alicaforsen, T-cell proliferation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory cytokine, immune stimulator, growth factor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor.

Large phase III, multicenter trials in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will provide valuable data for the ongoing development of vedolizumab, which might evolve as a new anti-inflammatory treatment option for the management of therapy-refractory patients. The development of a new specific molecule, vedolizumab, is currently under investigation in a large clinical trial. This novel specific anti-integrin drug seems to hold promise in the treatment of gut inflammation. The binding specificity and selective antagonism of vedolizumab, an anti-alpha4beta7 integrin therapeutic antibody in development for inflammatory bowel diseases. These pharmacologic properties of vedolizumab, in conjunction with the gastrointestinal tropism of alpha(4)beta(7) integrin function, may ultimately confer an improved risk-to-benefit profile for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. In the Crohn's disease study that included maintenance treatment, vedolizumab was significantly more effective at 52 weeks than placebo in both endpoints (clinical remission was the only primary endpoint in the maintenance study) Vedolizumab is a useful addition to the treatment options available for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52	[['Ulcerative colitis'], ["Crohn's disease"]]

PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade Bacterial genomes displaying a strong bias between the leading and the lagging strand of DNA replication encode two DNA polymerases III, DnaE and PolC, rather than a single one. SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC-PolE DNA polymerases We conclude that PAS is a characteristic of organisms with a heterodimeric DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit constituted by polC and dnaE, which may play a direct role in the maintenance of SGD. Furthermore, SGD, PAS, and polC are all features associated with a group of low-GC, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes) In contrast, PolC co-evolves with RNA degradation enzymes that are present only in the A+T-rich Firmicutes clade, suggesting at least two origins for the degradosome.

56cf4b623975bb303a00000a	List the neurotransmitters that are metabolized by MAOA.	 MAOA metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters.  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) modulates metabolism of serotonin and dopamine metabolism, neurotransmitters involved in regulation of appetite and food intake.  Tumors from patients with high-grade aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit increased expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine.  These traits are controlled by neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of amines, has been reported to be associated with aggression, impulsivity, depression, and mood changes. Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) is a critical enzyme in the catabolism of monoaminergic neurotransmitters.  Monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) have a key role in the degradation of amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin.  Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters including serotonin and norepinephrine, are commonly used to treat neurological conditions including depression.  Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one of the major enzymes responsible for the degradation of neurotransmitters. Monoamine oxidase membrane enzymes are responsible for the catalytic breakdown of extra- and intracellular neurotransmitters  Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a key mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin The monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) gene plays a vital role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, e.g, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

52bf1d6003868f1b0600000e	Which are the subtypes of Pfeiffer syndrome?	Of 802 patients treated for craniosynostosis, 28 were identified with Pfeiffer syndrome: 17 were classified as type I (61 percent), seven were classified as type II (25 percent), and four were classified as type III (14 percent).  Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes. Type 1 "classic" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull.  Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth.  It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307]. Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases. These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy. Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence.

5306158358348c0f52000001	Which genetic defects are observed in Prader-Willi syndrome?	Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disease caused by lack of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder caused by genetic defects in certain regions of chromosome 15q11-13. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an example of a human genetic disorder that involves imprinting genes on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 and SNRPN gene as a candidate gene for this syndrome. Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. The predominant genetic defects in PW are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy. In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-13 loci. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by absence of a paternal contribution of the chromosome region 15q11-q13, resulting from paternal deletions, maternal uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting mutations. Because methylation analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS. The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 15q11-q13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy (UPD). In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene. The genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) map to 15q11-13.

5149af96d24251bc05000046	Which are the state-of-the-art computational tools for the prediction of gene fusion events?	MosaicFinder: Identification of fused gene families in sequence similarity networks This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. Inference of gene function based on gene fusion events: the rosetta-stone method. The basic idea is based on the principle of "guilt by association." It is assumed that two proteins, which are found to be transcribed by a single transcript in one (or several) genomes are likely to be functionally linked, for example by acting in a same metabolic pathway or by forming a multiprotein complex. This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteins This chapter uses the FusionDB database (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) as source of information. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments. PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages. While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison. Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters. To investigate the fidelity of gene-fusion characters, we developed an approach for identifying differentially distributed gene fusions among whole-genome datasets: fdfBLAST. Genome-scale comparative analysis of gene fusions, gene fissions Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods--chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion Pairs of genes that function together in a pathway or cellular system can sometimes be found fused together in another organism as a Rosetta Stone protein--a fusion protein whose separate domains are homologous to the two functionally-related proteins. Using the Rosetta Stone method and this scoring scheme, we find all significant functional linkages for proteins of E. coli, P. horikshii and S. cerevisiae, and measure the extent of the resulting protein networks.

514a11add24251bc05000054	Which diseases can Oncotype DX be used for?	Prognostic and predictive markers Oncotype DX® currently allow avoidance of an over therapy or under therapy a high score on the Oncotype DX gene expression profile r poor-prognosis ER-positive breast cancers in need of more aggressive therapy luminal B class The 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX: RS) appears to augment clinico-pathologic prognostication and is predictive of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+), endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. Half of all breast cancers are early stage, lymph node negative, and hormone receptor positive. A 21-gene (Oncotype DX®; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) recurrence score (RS) is prognostic for recurrence and predictive of chemotherapy benefit. We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes. Molecular tests such as the Oncotype DX(®) breast cancer test are proving to be more effective tools for individualized patient stratification and treatment planning than traditional methods such as patient demographic variables and histopathology indicators. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy. The oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and treatment decisions. The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer. The 21-gene signature has been intensively studied and incorporated into major guidelines for treatment decision in early breast cancer. Among early-stage breast cancer patients who received Oncotype DX, we found low knowledge about many aspects of genomic recurrence risk testing. the gene expression signatures that define specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets, such as luminal A and B, basal, normal-like, and ERBB2+, and prognostic signatures including MammaPrint and Oncotype DX, predicted genomic instability in our samples. This remarkable congruence suggests a biological interdependence of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome. The Oncotype DX assay is one of the molecular tests that provide predictive and prognostic information to breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and node-negative disease. This study evaluates the association of Forkhead-box protein A1 (FOXA1) and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) expressions with Oncotype DX recurrences scores in 77 cases of patients with ER-positive node-negative breast carcinomas diagnosed at Indiana University. the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond to chemotherapy. The EWG found adequate evidence regarding the association of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with disease recurrence and adequate evidence for response to chemotherapy. EWG) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer. confirmed the clinical validity of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay, not only as a way to predict recurrence but also as a tool for determining therapeutic benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Over several decades, investigators working through National Cancer Institute-sponsored Cooperative Groups have contributed to major advances in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer. Cooperative Group studies have contributed to the development of a molecular profiling test, Oncotype Dx, which identifies women who have an excellent prognosis with hormonal therapy alone. In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. 78 women, treated for early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with 0-3 positive lymph nodes, whose medical records indicated they received Oncotype DX testing earlier.

5165932e298dcd4e51000059	Which are the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases inhibitors?	5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a nucleoside analog that can inhibit DNA cytosine methylation, possesses potent antitumorigenic activities for myeloid disorders. Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear. The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor. The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site. These results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme. Rapid synthesis of new DNMT inhibitors derivatives of procainamide. Six compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic Dnmt3A/3L complex and of human DNMT1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. The inhibitors showed selectivity for C5 DNA methyltransferases. DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site. A number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine. ODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers. The inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward DNMT may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues. Despite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the DNMT1 binding site. These findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel DNMT inhibitors. Inhibition of HhaI DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation. The presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro. Thus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action. Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI. Zebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases. The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism. Synthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites. The incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into DNA causes potent inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferases. T Mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferases by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine. Substitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine. These results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation. Analysis of DNA methylation processes related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by 5-azacytidine in Streptomyces antibioticus ETH 7451. Our results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on DNA and RNA synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase. DNA containing 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits methylation by HhaI methyltransferase. The inhibitory effect of the 4'sulfur atom on enzymatic activity may be traced to perturbation of a step in the methylation reaction after DNA binding but prior to methyl transfer. Treatment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with the C5 DNA methyltransferase (C5Mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has previously been shown to induce G2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize Foxp3 expression in Tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo. Booster of pluripotency: RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA), have recently been highlighted for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, their action mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Structurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to             5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen®), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor             (DNMTi). Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear. Human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW48, SW480) were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, followed by trichostatin A (TSA), as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. With increasing 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, the expression of DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Psammaplin A (11c) is a marine metabolite previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of two classes of epigenetic enzymes: histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. Defining the parameters of zebularine-mediated tumor inhibition may advance the future development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as an effective cancer treatment. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor [trichostatin A (TSA)] both significantly up-regulated miR-146a transcriptional activation by altering the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in macrophages isolated from aged mice, which suggests that DNA methylation and histone acetylation are involved in the suppression of age-dependent miR-146a expression. Diverse DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective DNMTIs. Currently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools. The effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined. Cooperative action of HDACi and DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTi) has been reported, making combined treatment an attractive choice for cancer therapy.

5516757c46478f2f2c000008	Which are the main NMD factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?	In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) requires Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p to accelerate the decay rate of two unique classes of transcripts: (1) nonsense mRNAs that arise through errors in gene expression, and (2) naturally occurring transcripts that lack coding errors but have built-in features that target them for accelerated decay (error-free mRNAs) In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p Our results indicate that Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p regulate decapping and exonucleolytic degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs. In addition, we show that these factors also regulate the same processes in the degradation of wild-type mRNAs This quality control pathway depends on the NMD-specific factors, Upf1p, Upf2p/Nmd2p, and Upf3p, as well as the two release factors, eRF1 and eRF3 (respectively designated Sup45p and Sup35p in yeast) In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation.  Association of yeast Upf1p with direct substrates of the NMD pathway  Translation termination factors eRF1 (Sup45) and eRF3 (Sup35) participate not only in the last step of protein synthesis but also in mRNA degradation and translation initiation via interaction with such proteins as Pab1, Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3. From these results, we conclude that sup111, sup112 and sup113 are mutant alleles of UPF2, UPF3 and UPF1, respectively, and thus attribute suppressor activity of these mutations to defects in the NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) machinery. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) requires Upf1p, Upf2p, and Upf3p to accelerate the decay rate of two unique classes of transcripts: (1) nonsense mRNAs that arise through errors in gene expression, and (2) naturally occurring transcripts that lack coding errors but have built-in features that target them for accelerated decay (error-free mRNAs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p. To date, human (h) Upf1 protein (p) (hUpf1p), a group 1 RNA helicase named after its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue that functions in both translation termination and NMD, has been the only factor shown to be required for NMD in mammalian cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapid degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs requires the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, the 5-to-3 exoribonuclease Xrn1p, and the three nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factors, Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three trans-acting factors (Upf1p to Upf3p) are required for NMD. Interactions between Upf1 and the decapping factors Edc3 and Pat1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of this pathway depends on the recognition of the PTC by the translational machinery and interaction of translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 with Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3 proteins. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of this pathway depends on the recognition of the PTC by the translational machinery and interaction of translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 with Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3 proteins NMD activation is also enabled by the absence of the poly(A)-binding protein, Pab1p, downstream of a termination event Of those, a group of weak and recessive suppressors, sup111, sup112 and sup113, is of particular interest because of their dependency on [PSI+], a yeast prion.

54df6ed91388e8454a000007	List non-surgical treatment modalities that are included in the Stupp protocol.	OBJECTIVE: It is now accepted that the concomitant administration of temozolomide with radiotherapy (Stupp regime), in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), significantly improves survival and this practice has been adopted locally since 2004. BACKGROUND: The introduction of ALA-Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp-protocol is representative of the major changes in glioblastoma therapy in the past years. CONCLUSIONS: FGS and radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol have induced an impressive improvement in overall survival in glioblastoma patients.  Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy.  The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients with primary GBM were postoperatively treated with either radiation and concomitant TMZ, followed by adjuvant TMZ (Stupp protocol) (n = 154), or radiation followed by adjuvant TMZ (n = 37). Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol.  The treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by chemoradiation with the protocol of Stupp et al.  Since the publication of a study by Stupp et al in 2005, which used a protocol of conventional fractionated irradiation with concomitant TMZ followed by standard TMZ for six cycles, many clinical studies in the People's Republic of China have demonstrated that such a treatment strategy has significantly improved efficacy with limited side effects for newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgery as compared with strategies that do not contain TMZ. Standard chemoradiotherapy as per the Stupp protocol, together with multimodal rehabilitation, resulted in substantial functional improvement within 6 weeks of initiation. BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma treated with BCNU wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the Stupp protocol. This is followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) according to the Stupp protocol.  CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status and low MGMT expression both were identified as positive prognosticators in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection and received Gliadel wafer implants followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant oral TMZ chemotherapy (the Stupp protocol). INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the incidence and impact of early post-chemoradiation (cRT) 'pseudoprogression' (PsPD) amongst glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with the current standard of care - 60 Gy conformal radiotherapy with concurrent low-dose temozolomide, followed by six cycles of high-dose temozolomide (the 'Stupp protocol').  In patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is no consensus on the sequential use of two existing regimens: post-operative Gliadel implantation into the surgical cavity and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide ('Stupp protocol').  We also screened for associations between the level of methylation of CpG sites and overall survival in a cohort of 50 patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (STUPP protocol).  Surprisingly, less than half the patients having surgery received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol.  We analyzed MGMT methylation by methylation-specific PCR in 90 GBM patients from four Portuguese hospitals, uniformly treated with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp protocol). The current care standards for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consist, when feasible, in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, as described in the Stupp protocol.  Moreover, there are no data concerning the effect of concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the STUPP protocol on the course ofMS in patients with coexisting glioblastoma.  Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the "Stupp protocol") or resection with implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy The standard treatment today is maximal surgical resection followed by concomitant chemo-radiation therapy followed by adjuvant TMZ according to Stupp protocol	[['radiotherapy'], ['chemotherapy']]
54e22b62ae9738404b000011	Which genes are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II?	It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the α1 and the α2-chain of type V collagen, respectively In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein Order of intron removal influences multiple splice outcomes, including a two-exon skip, in a COL5A1 acceptor-site mutation that results in abnormal pro-alpha1(V) N-propeptides and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I (the classical variety) is a dominantly inherited, genetically heterogeneous connective-tissue disorder. Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals. Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I Mutations of the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen impair matrix assembly and produce ehlers-danlos syndrome type I We have identified mutations of the COL5A2 gene, which encodes the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen, in two unrelated patients with the severe type I form of EDS Our findings show that heterozygous mutations of the COL5A2 gene can produce the EDS type I phenotype A splice-junction mutation in the region of COL5A1 that codes for the carboxyl propeptide of pro alpha 1(V) chains results in the gravis form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type I) We report that genomic polymorphisms at the pro alpha 1(V) gene (COL5A1) locus cosegregated with the gravis form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) (type I) in a three generation family Since exon 65 encodes 78 residues of the carboxyl propeptide, the expected result of this mutation is reduced efficiency in incorporating mutant pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen molecules and reduced type V collagen synthesis These studies indicate that heterozygous mutations in COL5A1 can result in EDS type I The gene encoding collagen alpha1(V)(COL5A1) is linked to mixed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II Recently, genetic linkage has been demonstrated between the COL5A1 gene, which encodes the alphal chain of type V collagen, and EDS type II in a large British kindred Using a polymorphic intragenic simple sequence repeat at the COL5A1 locus, we now demonstrate tight linkage to EDS type I/II in a three-generation family The variation in expression in this family suggests that EDS types I and II are allelic, and the linkage data support the hypothesis that mutation in COL5A1 can cause both phenotypes. Null alleles of the COL5A1 gene of type V collagen are a cause of the classical forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (types I and II). Recently mutations have been found in the genes for type V collagen in a small number of people with the most common forms of EDS, types I and II The gene encoding collagen alpha1(V)(COL5A1) is linked to mixed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II.

5512c1ee6a8cde6b72000009	Which proteins are the different isoforms of the p38 MAP kinase?	The p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) kinase, a serine/threonine kinase, is one of the best characterized kinases in the inflammatory process. Among the four identified p38 isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ), the α-form is the most fully studied and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines i.e. IL-1β and TNF-α at the translational and transcriptional levels. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the kinase pathways that regulate the production of IL-1β and TNFα. Importantly, small molecule inhibitors of the p38 MAPK family have been developed and show efficacy in blocking the production of IL-1β and TNFα. The p38 family consists of at least four isoforms (p38α, β, γ, δ) encoded by separate genes. Defining the roles of the various p38 family members, specifically p38alpha and p38beta, in these processes has been difficult.  The anomalous p38 inhibitor effect on IL-1alpha induction of MMP-3 and phosphorylation of p38 delta/gamma suggests complex interactions between p38 MAP kinase isoforms and their differential uses by TNFalpha and IL-1alpha in TM. Human and porcine TM cells expressed p38 alpha, beta, delta, and gamma isoforms, which migrate coincident with bands of specific phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is a Ser/Thr kinase, originally isolated from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. There are four isoforms of the enzyme (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta), which differ in tissue distribution, regulation of kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream substrates. We report the molecular cloning of a novel isoform of p38 MAP kinase, p38 beta 2. The p38 MAP kinase kinase MKK6 is identified as a common activator of p38 alpha, p38 beta 2, and p38 gamma MAP kinase isoforms, while MKK3 activates only p38 alpha and p38 gamma MAP kinase isoforms.  four identified p38 isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ),  The mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family is composed of four members (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ), which are very similar in amino acid sequence but differ in their expression patterns.  Four p38 isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta) exist in mammalian cells, being p38alpha and p38gamma the most abundantly expressed isoforms in adult skeletal muscle.  Among the four identified p38 isoforms (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ), the α-form is the most fully studied and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines i The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated in response to various extracellular signals in eukaryotic cells and play a critical role in the cellular responses to these signals. The four mammalian isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma, and p38delta) are coexpressed and coactivated in the same cells. four p38 isoforms  p38 MAPK isoforms are becoming increasingly important for a variety of cellular functions. The physiological functions of p38α and -β are now well documented in contrast to -γ and -δ which are comparatively under-studied and ill-defined. Of the four p38 isoforms known to date, two (p38alpha and p38beta) have been identified as targets for cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs.  the contribution of each of the four p38 isoforms (encoded by different genes) to senescence induction is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that p38alpha and p38gamma, but not p38beta, play an essential role in oncogenic ras-induced senescence.  Involvement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms in myogenic differentiation. we showed here that p38alpha, beta, and gamma are expressed with distinct expression patterns during differentiation. The p38 family of kinases is a subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. It is composed of four isoforms and is involved in critical biological processes as well as in inflammatory diseases p38alpha and -beta2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p38gamma and -delta appear to have more restricted expression.

54fb5c69d176fff445000003	Which are the 3 basic transcription factors that have been used for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte like-cells?	Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT). Here we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for in vitro cardiac reprogramming using retroviruses encoding GMT. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C.  Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors. Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.  We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, in vitro and in vivo. To assess the efficiency of direct fibroblast reprogramming via viral overexpression of GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT).   In addition, transplantation of GMT infected CFs into injured mouse hearts resulted in decreased cell survival with minimal induction of cardiomyocyte genes. Here, to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes. Through this screening method the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4 that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously. More recently, we showed that reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo after coronary artery ligation using three cardiac transcription factors (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) offers an alternative approach to regenerate heart muscle. Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i.e., Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Srivastava's group reported the first direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblast cells into mesoderm lineage cells (cardiomyocytes) with the enforced expression of three cardiac transcriptional factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.

5542644fed966d112c000004	Which are the methods for in silico prediction of the origin of replication (ori) among bacteria?	Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics we have applied a combination of multiple in silico approaches - Z curve, the cell division cycle (cdc6) gene location and location of consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences for location of origin of replication Using features that have been previously experimentally verified in the alpha-Proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, the origin of DNA replication (ori) regions were identified in silico for Wolbachia strains and eleven other related bacteria belonging to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia genera. These features include DnaA-, CtrA- and IHF-binding sites as well as the flanking genes in C. crescentus. The sequences of the ori regions described here are only similar among closely related bacteria while fundamental characteristics like presence of DnaA and IHF binding sites as well as the boundary genes are more widely conserved. We propose a correlation measure and show that it is correctly able to predict the origin of replication in most of the bacterial genomes. When applied to Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast and Nicotiana tabacum plastid, this correlation based method is able to correctly predict the origin of replication whereas the generally used GC skew measure fails. DNA base composition asymmetry is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes. These analyses include finding the dnaA gene and its binding sites; making BLAST analyses of the intergenic sequences compared to related species; studying the gene order around the origin sequence; and studying the distribution of the genes encoded in the leading versus the lagging strand. DnaA binds a single DnaA box as a monomer In silico comparative analysis of sequenced mollicute genomes indicated the lack of conservation of gene order in the region containing the predicted origin of replication (oriC) and the existence, in most of the mollicute genomes examined, of putative DnaA boxes lying upstream and downstream from the dnaA gene. In this paper we have applied a combination of multiple in silico approaches - Z curve, the cell division cycle (cdc6) gene location and location of consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences for location of origin of replication in Thermococcus onnurineus, Thermococcus gammatolerans and other Themococcales and compared the results to that of the well-documented case of Pyrococcus abyssi. DNA base composition asymmetry is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes. It increases the prediction accuracy of the replication termini compared with previously documented methods based on genomic base composition. Using compositional skews such as the GC skew, replication origin and terminus can be predicted in silico by observing the shift points.

550316a6e9bde69634000029	Which diseases have been associated with the PTPN22 620W allele?	The frequency of the minor allele (620W) was significantly higher in GPA patients than in controls [P = 0.005, χ(2 )= 7.858, odds ratio (OR) = 1.91], while no statistically significant association was found with MPA or CSS. Among GPA patients, the 620W allele was particularly enriched in ANCA-positive patients as compared with controls (P = 0.00012, χ(2 )=���14.73, OR = 2.31) The PTPN22 620W allele confers susceptibility to the development of GPA (but not of MPA or CSS), and particularly of its ANCA-positive subset The PTPN22 620W allele is a risk factor for Wegener's granulomatosis Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders The PTPN22 620W allele frequency was significantly increased in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive WG patients compared with healthy controls The PTPN22 620W allele appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of WG, and ANCA positivity seems to be the hallmark Rheumatoid arthritis seropositive for the rheumatoid factor is linked to the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22-620W allele The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes for lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase LYP, involved in the negative regulation of early T-cell activation. An association has recently been reported between the PTPN22-620W functional allele and rheumatoid factor-positive (RF+) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among other autoimmune diseases A functional variant (R620W) of the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22) has now been conclusively shown to confer approximately two-fold risk for seropositive RA as well as several other autoimmune disorders the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto thyroiditis The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). The risk of developing RA later in life in patients with type 1 DM may be attributed, in part, to the presence of the 620W PTPN22 allele, suggesting that this risk factor may represent a common pathway for the pathogenesis of these 2 diseases. The minor allele of the R620W missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2476601) in the PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22) gene has been reported to be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis and vitiligo.

56ddbbaf51531f7e33000009	Which histone modifications distinguish between promoters and enhancers?	Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure genome-wide changes in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a marker of active enhancers, in unstimulated HUVECs and HUVECs stimulated with VEGFA for 1, 4, and 12 h. Here we use whole-transcriptome analysis coupled with genome-wide profiling of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 to map chromatin states and enhancers in mouse embryonic forelimb and hindlimb. Using H3K27ac profiles, we identified 28,377 putative enhancers, many of which are likely to be limb specific based on strong enrichment near genes highly expressed in the limb and comparisons with tissue-specific EP300 sites and known enhancers.  a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of H3K27ac marking, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong depletion of H3K27me3 We also find that some developmental enhancers exhibit components of this signature, including hypersensitivity, H3K27ac enrichment, and H3K27me3 depletion, at lower levels in tissues in which they are not active. At some locations, H3K27 monomethylation was also found to be associated with chromatin signatures of gene enhancers. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers.  We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.  Although certain chromatin features, such as the histone acetyltransferase P300 and the histone modification H3K4me1, indicate the presence of enhancers, only a fraction of enhancers are functionally active. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers.

The clinical features of cytopenia, developmental defects, and tumor predisposition are similar in each group, suggesting that the gene products participate in a common pathway. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia and predisposition to both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors Patients with FA exhibit a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical features. The most significant and consistent phenotypic characteristics are stem cell loss, causing progressive bone marrow failure and sterility, diverse developmental abnormalities and a profound predisposition to neoplasia Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, cancer susceptibility disorder characterized by diverse clinical features, such as short stature, skeletal or skin abnormalities, progressive bone marrow (BM) failure, and increased risk of malignancies Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by congenital abnormalities, defective haemopoiesis, and a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia and certain solid tumours Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer.

53355befd6d3ac6a34000046	List programs suitable for protein docking	We present CSBB-ConeExclusion, a methodology and computer program which provides a measure of the applicability of solution dockings to solid support The structure of the α1I-peptide complex was investigated using data from NMR, small angle x-ray scattering, and size exclusion chromatography that were used to generate and validate a model of the complex using the data-driven docking program, HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven Biomolecular Docking).  We report the performance of our approaches for protein-protein docking and interface analysis in CAPRI rounds 20-26. At the core of our pipeline was the ZDOCK program for rigid-body protein-protein docking GalaxyDock protein-ligand docking program is introduced. GalaxyDock performs conformational space annealing (CSA) global optimization to find the optimal binding pose of a ligand both in the rigid-receptor mode and the flexible-receptor mode Utilizing NMR titration data, we generated the structural models of S100B-FGF2 complex from the computational docking program, HADDOCK which were further proved stable during 15ns unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations Thereafter, all molecules were docked into the newly generated active site environment of the selected protein using glide docking program, and the 3D-QSAR analysis was performed in PHASE program utilizing the docking based alignment of the molecules DockRank uses interface residues predicted by partner-specific sequence homology-based protein-protein interface predictor (PS-HomPPI), which predicts the interface residues of a query protein with a specific interaction partner. We compared the performance of DockRank with several state-of-the-art docking scoring functions using Success Rate (the percentage of cases that have at least one near-native conformation among the top m conformations) and Hit Rate (the percentage of near-native conformations that are included among the top m conformations).  In this study, we developed a novel scoring program, HotLig, which applies the Connolly surface of a protein to calculate hydrophobic interaction and paired pharmacophore interactions with ligands. In addition to molecular surface distance, ligand-contacting areas and hydrogen-bond angles were also introduced to the scoring functions in HotLig a method called residue contact frequency (RCF), which uses the complex structures generated by the protein-protein docking algorithm ZDOCK to predict interface residues devoted to results obtained by the docking program SOL and the post-processing program DISCORE at the CSAR benchmark. SOL and DISCORE programs are described. SOL is the original docking program developed on the basis of the genetic algorithm, MMFF94 force field, rigid protein, precalculated energy grid including desolvation in the frame of simplified GB model, vdW, and electrostatic interactions and taking into account the ligand internal strain energy improves the binding energy scoring by the local energy optimization of the ligand docked pose and a simple linear regression on the base of available experimental data The template-based methods showed similar performance to a docking method (ZDOCK) when the latter was allowed one prediction for each complex, but when the same number of predictions was allowed for each method, the docking approach outperformed template-based approaches VinaMPI is a massively parallel Message Passing Interface (MPI) program based on the multithreaded virtual docking program AutodockVina, and is used to distribute tasks while multithreading is used to speed-up individual docking tasks Prime and the binding energy function in YASARA suggested it could be possible to evaluate the quality of the orthosteric binding site based on the prediction of relative binding energies  is a free and open source application that unifies a suite of software programs within a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate molecular docking experiments This article presents DockTrina, a novel protein docking method for modeling the 3D structures of nonsymmetrical triangular trimers To account for the important docking interactions between the UBSAs ligand and hCA II enzyme, a molecular docking program AutoDock Vina is used. The molecular docking results obtained by AutoDock Vina revealed that the docked conformer has root mean square deviation value less than 1.50 Å compared to X-ray crystal structures. Four possible binding pockets (Pocket A, B, C, and D) at the stalk region of hemagglutinin were detected and defined using the CAVITY program Within this context, low-resolution shape data obtained from either ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) or SAXS experiments have been integrated into the conventional scoring function of the information-driven docking program HADDOCK a novel de novo design program, called LiGen, we developed a docking program, LiGenDock, based on pharmacophore models of binding sites, including a non-enumerative docking algorithm. we present the functionalities of LiGenDock and its accompanying module LiGenPocket, aimed at the binding site analysis and structure-based pharmacophore definition Here we describe the application of the program AutoDock to the design of a focused library that was used in the "click chemistry in-situ" generation of the most potent noncovalent inhibitor of the native enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) yet developed (K(d) = ~100 fM).   the method yields improved success over the standard DOCK energy function for pose identification across a large test set of experimental co-crystal structures, for crossdocking, and for database enrichment The pose prediction success rate of each docking program alone was found in this trial to be 55% for Autodock, 58% for DOCK, and 64% for Vina.

We detected a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome.  The genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. Here we show that mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts.  Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759 corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln.

550712739d0faaa527000008	Which mutations in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been found to be related to CPVT?	Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2. The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays. The S4153R mutation enhanced propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and reduced SOICR threshold but did not alter Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding, a common feature of other CPVT gain-of-function RYR2 mutations. We conclude that the S4153R mutation is a gain-of-function RYR2 mutation associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by both CPVT and atrial fibrillation. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction.  We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05). The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a "leaky" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.   Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals. RyR2 mutations suggested to cause defective Ca2+ channel function have recently been identified in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) affected individuals. We report expression of three CPVT-linked human RyR2 (hRyR2) mutations (S2246L, N4104K, and R4497C) in HL-1 cardiomyocytes displaying correct targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.  We developed a conditional knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation, the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families, to evaluate if the animals would develop a CPVT phenotype and if beta blockers would prevent arrhythmias. These data provide the first experimental demonstration that the R4496C RyR2 mutation predisposes the murine heart to VT and VF in response caffeine and/or adrenergic stimulation.

Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. the miR-494 content significantly decreased after endurance exercise in C57BL/6J mice, accompanied by an increase in expression of mtTFA and Foxj3 proteins.

Our data reveal another mechanism through which KB-R7943 may protect against calcium-induced injury, as well as a novel means to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. KB-R7943, a plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, blocks opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) regulator, also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and H2O2.  Unlike pyrrophenone, the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and CsA blocked cell death and arachidonic acid release not by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake but by inhibiting MPTP formation. Incubation with β3AR agonist (BRL37344, 7 μmol/L) significantly reduced cell death in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation and decreased susceptibility to deleterious opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), via a mechanism dependent on the Akt-NO signaling pathway.  Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D. Indeed, (i) permeability transition pore inhibition by antamanide is not additive with the cyclophilin D-binding drug cyclosporin A, (ii) the inhibitory action of antamanide on the pore requires phosphate, as previously shown for cyclosporin A; (iii) antamanide is ineffective in mitochondria or cells derived from cyclophilin D null animals, and (iv) abolishes CyP-D peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Furthermore, in wild-type (non-transfected) SHSY5Y cells, the effects of lactacystin on mitochondrial function and cell viability are also prevented by cyclosporin A (1 μM) which blocks the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore Exogenous zinc protects cardiac cells from reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Bradykinin prevents reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. HIF-1 reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the heart by targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Pre—treatment of gallic acid and mitochondrially targeted gallic acid to sodium nitroprusside treated mitochondria not only significantly reduced the oxidative stress but also prevented mitochondrial permeability pore transition to a significant difference. Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid. Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid. We conclude that mitochondrially targeted gallic acid can be used for preventing mitochondrial impairment caused by oxidative stress. The involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore was determined with a mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside and a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A. Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D. Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid. Pre—treatment of gallic acid and mitochondrially targeted gallic acid to sodium nitroprusside treated mitochondria not only significantly reduced the oxidative stress but also prevented mitochondrial permeability pore transition to a significant difference.

These effects can be combined with the beneficial effects of these compounds on some other major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (e.g. tau hyperphosphorylation and paired helical filaments [PHF]; and loss of cholinergic function conducive to cognitive impairments.)

517539e68ed59a060a000028	Which mitochondrial genes are regulated by thyroid hormone?	We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mRNA differential display (DD) analysis to obtain a profile of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in osteoblast-like cells At the 2-hour time point, 1 true-positive novel clone was identified and shown to be the mitochondrial gene, subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATPase-6). We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment. Following this procedure, we now report the identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as target of thyroid hormone. Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene.

518cb5ab310faafe08000008	Which are the best treatment options to treat Helicobacter pylori?	Triple therapy, which has been the mainstay of treatment in many countries over the last decade, now has suboptimal results in many parts of the world. equential therapy and quadruple therapy (either bismuth-based or non-bismuth-based) are the best current options to replace initial treatment with triple therapy. olecular tests can be used to detect H. pylori and clarithromycin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance in gastric biopsies without necessitating culture. In regions of high clarithromycin resistance, such as France, sequential treatment or bismuth-containing quadruple therapies are replacing standard triple therapies for the first-line empirical treatment. The evidence in favour of bismuth compounds for treating infected children is still not clear. Chitosan microspheres with multiple Eudragit L100 cores were easily prepared by a new emulsification/coagulation encapsulating method. the multi-core chitosan microspheres could serve as a satisfactory vehicle for stomach-specific delivery of hydrophilic antibiotics. Treatment consisted of a one-week regimen containing a PPI twice daily, amoxicillin (A) 1 g twice daily and rifabutin (R) 300 mg once daily (PPI-AR). Pretreatment antibiotic susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin and A was evaluated using a validated epsilometer test. four different strategies for prevention of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer hemorrhage: 1) test for H. pylori and treatment, if positive; 2) proton pump inhibitor maintenance; 3) no preventive treatment; 4) empirical H. pylori eradication immediately after bleeding. Empirical H. pylori eradication was the dominant strategy: its estimated rate of recurrent bleeding was lower (6.1%) than those of strategies 1 (7.4%), 2 (11.1%), and 3 (18.4%) and it was the least expensive strategy. The results remained stable when variables were changed inside a wide range of plausible values. In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, empirical treatment of H. pylori infection immediately after feeding is restarted is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing recurrent hemorrhage.

570a6d03cf1c325851000025	List sclerostin interaction partners.	 Several previously unidentified full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, gremlin-1, fetuin A, midkine, annexin A1 and A2, and collagen α1, which have established roles in bone formation or resorption processes, were bound to the sclerostin-MBP amylose resin but not to the MBP amylose resin. Other full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as casein kinase II and secreted frizzled related protein 4 that modulate Wnt signaling were identified. Several peptides derived from proteins such as Phex, asporin and follistatin that regulate bone metabolism also bound sclerostin.  We identified an interaction between sclerostin and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3. Sclerostin, SOST, the gene affected in this disease, has been postulated to exert its activity by functioning as a BMP antagonist. However, recent evidence indicates that SOST is highly related to Wise, which can also modulate the Wnt pathway by binding to LRP5 and LRP6. Bone density ligand, Sclerostin, directly interacts with LRP5 but not LRP5G171V to modulate Wnt activity.

54db7217c4c6ce8e1d000003	How many and which are the different isoforms for the ryanodine receptor?	Skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac muscle (RyR2) isoforms of ryanodine receptor calcium channels Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are located in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum membrane and are responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores during excitation-contraction coupling in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. RyRs are the largest known ion channels (> 2MDa) and exist as three mammalian isoforms (RyR 1-3), Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of intracellular calcium release channels that mediate calcium-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Among the three RyR isoforms, RyR3 is preferentially expressed in the brain especially in the hippocampus and striatum. In excitable cells such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes excitation-contraction coupling is an important intermediate step between initiation of the action potential and induction of contraction. This process is predominantly controlled by Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor. This very large protein (MW 560 kDa) exists as a homotetramer (~2.2 MDa) and is expressed in three isoforms: RyR1, expressed in skeletal muscle; RyR2, expressed in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, expressed in various cells at lower levels than the other isoforms.  Generally, three ryanodine receptor isoforms (RyR1-RyR3) are known;  Ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a Ca(2+) channel that mediates Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. There are three RyR isoforms, Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular Ca(2+) channels that mediate the release of calcium from internal stores and therefore play an important role in Ca(2+) signaling and homeostasis. Three RyR isoforms have been described thus far, RyR1 and RyR2 RyR3 Three different isoforms of the SR Ca2+ release channels, or ryanodine receptors (RyRs), have been isolated (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3).

5506a7a48e1671127b000008	Which protein phosphatases have been found to dephosphorylate phospholamban?	The protein phosphatases which dephosphorylate native, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-associated phospholamban were studied in cardiac muscle extracts and in a Triton fraction prepared by detergent extraction of myofibrils, the latter fraction containing 70-80% of the SR-associated proteins present in the tissue. At physiological concentrations of free Mg2+ (1 mM), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) accounted for approximately 70% of the total phospholamban phosphatase activity in these fractions towards either Ser-16 (the residue labelled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PK-A) or Thr-17 (the residue phosphorylated by an SR-associated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) accounted for the remainder of the activity. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A	[['Protein Phosphatase 1', 'PP1'], ['Protein phosphatase 2A', 'PP2A'], ['Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'PP2C'], ['Protein Phosphatase 2B', 'PP2B']]

532c0ac4d6d3ac6a3400001a	What are the main benefits of pharmacophore models?	To discover novel RNAP inhibitors, a pharmacophore based on the alignment of described inhibitors was used for virtual screening. In an optimization process of hit compounds, novel derivatives with improved in vitro potency were discovered. Investigations concerning the molecular mechanism of RNAP inhibition reveal that they prevent the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between σ(70) and the RNAP core enzyme. the primary structural features required for estrogen receptor binding, the phenols, are not required for inhibiting parasitic growth. Significantly, the most active antileishmanial benzothiophenes lack the pharmacophore for estrogen receptor activity and therefore address potential concerns about the undesirable effects of using selective estrogen receptor modulators in women and children with leishmaniasis.  series of novel diastereoisomeric σ ligands 3 was designed, synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. The highly rigid [4.3.3]propellane scaffold was used to fix the three dimensional orientation of the pharmacophoric moieties required for σ affinity This study was performed to identify natural iNOS inhibitors from traditional Chinese herbs through a combination of pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking and virtual screening. First, the pharmacophore models were generated though six known iNOS inhibitors and validated by a test database.

589c215778275d0c4a00003c	Which enzymes synthesize catecholamines in adrenal glands?	We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls. This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.  In the adrenal medulla, despite the absence of morphological changes, immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenyl-ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase demonstrated an increased immunopositivity for these cathecolamine-synthesizing enzymes after intense exercise.  Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals. However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group. There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57.3%, P<0.004) in adrenal glands of obese mice. Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47.0%, P<0.005). Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected.  Differential housing (single vs. group) and social defeat of rats is known to alter the activity of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the medulla. The present studies examined the effect of 70 days of triad (3 rats per large cage) and individual housing of male rats on adrenal mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and on TH protein levels. As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands.  We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas.  These findings indicate that catecholamine overproduction in pheochromocytomas is mediated by the overexpression of genes coding for catecholamines synthesizing enzymes, TH, DBH, and AADC. he present study investigated the cellular localization of 3 catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)  tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) the rate limiting catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme and also of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in sympathetic ganglia and adrenals This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.

58a7fb2860087bc10a000034	Which mutated genes are associated with the Tourette's syndrome?	 A rare genetic form of Tourette syndrome due to L-histidine-decarboxylase mutation, with similar features in human and rodent, has inspired new research on functional anatomy of Tourette syndrome. A mutation in histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of histamine (HA), has been implicated as a rare genetic cause. Histidine decarboxylase deficiency causes tourette syndrome: parallel findings in humans and mice. Tourette syndrome (TS), the most severe end of the continuum of tic disorders, is substantially genetic, but causative mutations have been elusive. The SLITRK1 gene encodes a developmentally regulated stimulator of neurite outgrowth and previous studies have implicated rare variants in this gene in disorders in the OC spectrum, specifically Tourette syndrome (TS) The recent implication of the histamine decarboxylase (HDC) gene, the key enzyme in histamine production, raises the intriguing hypothesis of a possible role of histaminergic dysfunction leading to TS onset. we describe an analysis of linkage in a two-generation pedigree leading to the identification of a rare functional mutation in the HDC gene encoding L-histidine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in histamine biosynthesis. Mutations in the gene SLITRK1 (Slit and Trk-like 1) have been reported in patients with Tourette's disorder (TD) Recently, two variants, including a single-base deletion resulting in a truncated protein and a 3'-untranslated-region variant altering a binding site for micro-RNA in the Slit and Trk-like 1 gene, were found to be a genetic cause of Tourette syndrome. Collectively, these findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS.	[['histidine decarboxylase', 'Hdc'], ['Slit and Trk-like 1', 'SLITRK1']]

For women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapies, including the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant, are recommended in clinical guidelines. Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. Identification of GDC-0810 (ARN-810), an Orally Bioavailable Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) that Demonstrates Robust Activity in Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer Xenografts. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-α and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents.  Evaluation of the pharmacological activities of RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor degrader. However, being the only SERD currently known to access the brain, RAD1901 merits evaluation as a targeted therapy for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases. Tamoxifen, toremifene, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant are used to treat breast cancer, and tamoxifen and raloxifene protect against breast cancer in high-risk women. The turnover of estrogen receptor α by the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant is a saturable process that is not required for antagonist efficacy. Currently, ICI 182,780 (ICI, fulvestrant) is the only SERD approved for the treatment of breast cancer.  Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-á and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-α and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents RAD1901: a novel, orally bioavailable selective estrogen receptor degrader that demonstrates antitumor activity in breast cancer xenograft models. RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation.  The selective estrogen receptor degrader, fulvestrant, significantly reduced the anchorage-independent growth of ESR1 mutant-expressing cells, while combination treatments with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, or an inhibitor blocking IGF1R, and the insulin receptor significantly enhanced anti-proliferative responses. SUM-44 cells do not require exogenous estrogen for growth in vitro; however, they are dependent on ERα expression, as ESR1 knock-down or exposure to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in growth inhibition.

58a2efec60087bc10a000008	Which are the consequences of the hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers' Disease?	The formation of neurofibrillary tangles from the assembly of hyperphosphorylated tau leads to dendritic and axonal instability, synaptic degeneration, and neuronal loss.  Glutamate metabolism is impaired in transgenic mice with tau hyperphosphorylation. In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the protein tau is hyperphosphorylated and eventually aggregates to develop neurofibrillary tangles.  Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a marker of neuronal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, are comprised of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. At 24 months, NFTs progress, tau inclusions propagate to the dentate gyrus, and neuronal loss is evident.  At autopsy, brains of AD and a subset of TBI victims display some similarities including accumulation of Aβ peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.  The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)--widespread synaptic and neuronal loss and the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques, as well as hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles--have been known for many decades, but the links between AD pathology and dementia and effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive.  The microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated form, aggregates into insoluble paired-helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Pseudohyperphosphorylation causing AD-like changes in tau has significant effects on its polymerization. In AD, kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) are believed to be involved in the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, the functional consequences of hyperphosphorylation on the microtubule binding and polymerization of tau are not well understood.  Pseudophosphorylation of tau decreases its affinity for microtubules, and pseudohyperphosphorylated forms of tau do not have significantly decreased levels of microtubule binding as compared to single and double sites.  On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation. Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. Tau is the major component of the neurofibrillar tangles that are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers' disease. Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are found in a group of diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimers disease In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments On the basis of the observations that pseudohyperphosphorylated tau has decreased affinity for microtubules and reduced inducer-initiated rates of nucleation and polymerization, we propose that this combination could be the cause of the increased cytotoxicity of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimers disease and also explain the potentially beneficial role of tau polymerization and NFT formation In the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease, tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into intraneuronal deposits called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, both made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, point to an alteration of microtubules in Alzheimers disease Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.  In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, and aggregates into insoluble filaments. The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments. Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in affected neurons of Alzheimer disease brain. This hyperphosphorylated tau can be dephosphorylated at some of the abnormal phosphorylated sites by purified protein phosphatase-1, 2A, and 2B in vitro. Adult human nerve cells contain tau protein, a phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein, that is hyperphosphorylated in the fetus and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation, which diminishes the microtubule-binding capacity of tau, destabilizes microtubules and may enhance the formation of paired helical filaments that constitute neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, hyperphosphorylated tau comprises the paired helical filament, whose pathological deposition as neurofibrillary tangles is implicated in Alzheimer's disease; hyperphosphorylated tau is also implicated in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tau is ~three to four-fold more hyperphosphorylated than the normal adult brain tau and in this hyperphosphorylated state it is polymerized into paired helical filaments ([PHF) admixed with straight filaments (SF) forming neurofibrillary tangles.

58a45d6060087bc10a00001d	Which diseases are involved in the severe cutaneous reactions (SCAR) spectrum?	Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are diseases within the spectrum of severe cutaneous adverse reactions affecting skin and mucous membranes.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions that predominantly involve the skin and mucous membranes. Currently, TEN and SJS are considered to be two ends of a spectrum of severe epidermolytic adverse cutaneous drug reactions, differing only by their extent of skin detachment.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are considered part of a spectrum of adverse cutaneous drug reactions showing severe and extensive skin detachment. Our aim was to study patch testing in severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and other cutaneous ADRs) However, allopurinol is also one of the most common causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which include drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Drug eruptions range from transient erythema to the life threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) that encompass Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms complex (DRESS).To study the clinical and epidemiological aspects of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR).Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) are severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) which are majorly caused by drugs This study investigated the association between the HLA class I genotype and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) in Koreans.Twenty-four patients who had developed carbamazepine-induced SCAR (7 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 17 drug hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS)), 50 carbamazepine-tolerant controls from the Korean Pharmacogenetic Adverse Drug Reaction Research Network and data of 485 Korean general population from a previously published study were recruited Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (SCAR) represents the spectrum of adverse drug reactions from erythema multiforme, Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) to Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).  Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon but extremely serious and often life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions characterized by extensive epithelial sloughing and systemic symptoms. There is no effective evidence-based treatment for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) to drugs and no consensus on how to treat these patients. However, allopurinol is also one of the most common causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which include drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. A variant allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B, HLA-B*58:01, associates strongly with allopurinolinduced SCAR. The skin is often involved in ADRs and although most cutaneous ADRs have a favorable course, they may present as severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. By comparison, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), mainly caused by drugs. The study sought to identify the magnitude and characteristic of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR's) like Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). Allopurinol, an antihyperuricaemic agent, is one of the common causes of life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN).

58a0da5278275d0c4a000054	For what indications is thalidomide currently marketed?	In this retrospective study, pharmacy claims were analyzed for those patients with a diagnosis of MM who received thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide from a large specialty pharmacy in the US between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a fatal systemic disorder associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and the overproduction of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Recently, the prognosis of POEMS was substantially improved by introduction of therapeutic intervention for myeloma. However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome Thalidomide could relieve clinical symptoms and intestinal mucosal lesions effectively in children with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from the pre-clinical study. In reactional states of leprosy the use of thalidomide is established. The use of thalidomide was never discontinued in Brazil where it is prescribed for leprosy type 2 reaction. New uses of thalidomide. Currently, it is used for a few indications; in Brazil, where leprosy is endemic, thalidomide is used for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, and recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy have been reported.We analyzed the frequency of births with phenotypes consistent with thalidomide embryopathy (TEP) and correlated this with the distribution of thalidomide and the prevalence of leprosy between 2005 and 2010 in Brazil.A total of 5,889,210 thalidomide tablets were distributed; the prevalence of limb reduction defects was 1.60 (CI95%: 1.54-1.66) and TEP was 0.11 (CI95%: 0.10-0.13) per 10,000 births. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) To explore the inhibitory effect of thalidomide combined with interferon (IFN) on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line Kasumi- 1 and its mechanism.The inhibitiory effect of Kasumi- 1 cells by thalidomide, interferon or combination was detected by CCK- 8 method, the apoptosis by flow cytometry, the expression of apoptosis related proteins by Western blot, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in culture supernatant by ELISA.Thalidomide inhibited the proliferation of Kasumi- 1 in a dose- dependent manner from 50 μg/ml to 500 μg/ml with an IC₅₀ of (451. Interferon (INF)-α was the maintenance treatment of choice after autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma in the past, but currently Thalidomide is commonly used However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome, with an additional 48-week open-label safety study Thalidomide, mainly used for the treatment of leprosy, is a current teratogen in South America, and it is reasonable to assume that at present this situation is affecting many births in underdeveloped countries.  Currently, it is used for a few indications; in Brazil, where leprosy is endemic, thalidomide is used for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, and recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy have been reported.We analyzed the frequency of births with phenotypes consistent with thalidomide embryopathy (TEP) and correlated this with the distribution of thalidomide and the prevalence of leprosy between 2005 and 2010 in Brazil.A total of 5,889,210 thalidomide tablets were distributed; the prevalence of limb reduction defects was 1.60 (CI95%: 1.54-1.66) and TEP was 0.11 (CI95%: 0.10-0.13) A review of the therapeutic indications for thalidomide in dermatology as well as the mechanisms of action and side-effects of this drug are presented. Thalidomide first was marketed as a sedative in the 1950s and withdrawn from the market in 1961 following reports of teratogenicity. Later, it was used as an investigational agent for the treatment of Hansen's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, myelofibrosis, RAUs, and wasting associated with HIV. The drug has since been found effective for several different indications. Based on present publications we review indications of the therapy of dermatoses with thalidomide as well as possible mechanisms of action and side effects of this drug. Use of thalidomide in dermatological indications. Current data demonstrates that thalidomide is clinically promising in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme and renal cell cancer. Erythema nodosum leprosum is the only registered indication for the use of thalidomide in the United States of America. Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV. Gradually, thalidomide was reintroduced for the treatment of a few skin diseases including leprous erythema nodosum, severe mucosal ulcers (e.g., associated with HIV infection or Behçet's disease), lymphocytic skin infiltrations, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic graft-versus-host disease Thalidomide has been used in several cutaneous inflammatory disorders (such as erythema nodosum leprosum in lepromatous leprosy, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe aphtosis), cancers (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) and inflammatory conditions. This drug was more recently rediscovered as a powerful immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory agent and was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum.  Since, however, it has been found to be an effective drug in erythema nodosum leprosum	[['Multiple myeloma'], ['polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein and skin changes', 'POEMS'], ['Irritable Bowels Syndrome ', 'IBS']]
58932cd87d9090f353000001	Which human syndromes have been detected with Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)?	We demonstrate that, using a sensitive FISH technique, 12p deletion occurs significantly more frequently in MDS than previously described (7.6% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 1.6% by CBA, P<0.001) and is often associated with other aberrations (93% by CD34+ PB-FISH vs. 60% by CBA) Somatic chromosomal mosaicism arising from post-zygotic errors is known to cause several well-defined genetic syndromes as well as contribute to phenotypic variation in diseases. The mosaicism was characterized and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or chromosome analysis. Different categories of abnormal cell lines were detected: (1) aneuploidy, including sex chromosome abnormalities and isochromosomes (22 cases), (2) ring or marker chromosomes (12 cases), (3) single deletion/duplication copy number variations (CNVs) (11 cases), (4) multiple deletion/duplication CNVs (5 cases), (5) exonic CNVs (4 cases), and (6) unbalanced translocations (3 cases).  Positive cases with MLPA technique were confirmed using either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or follow up confirmatory MLPA probe sets. The deletions/duplications detected in non telomeric regions include regions for Prader Willi/Angelman regions, Williams syndrome, Smith Magenis syndrome and Velocardiofacial syndrome. The bone marrow specimen from a patient with MDS was comprehensively analyzed by a combination of genomic approaches, including chromosomal karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome scanning using Affymetrix high density SNP microarray platform, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using IonTorrent Cancer Gene Panel. Detection of TET2 abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of TP53 for the detection of chromosome 17 abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can effectively demonstrate TET2 deletions and is often used to validate molecular results.  These findings demonstrate that 1) FISH is an effective and economical method to reveal cryptic abnormalities of band 4q22-q24 resulting in TET2 deletions; FISH and SNP-A karyotyping in myelodysplastic syndromes: improving cytogenetic detection of del(5q), monosomy 7, del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q).  Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N=52), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N=7) and acute myeloid leukemia (N=15) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping.  We conclude that MC, FISH and SNP-A are complementary techniques that, when applied and interpreted together, can improve the diagnostic yield for identifying genetic lesions in MDS and contribute to the better description of abnormal karyotypes. Here, we report the detection of a reciprocal translocation t(7;21)(p22;q22) in the marrow of two adults with MDS and AML, using conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH). Detection of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5,7 and 8 in myelodysplastic syndromes with fluorescence in situ hybridization and its clinical significance To identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases.  FISH detected monosomy 7 in 6 samples at the time MDS was diagnosed and in 2 samples at the time AA was diagnosed. As chromosomal instability may contribute to leukemogenesis in patients with congenital bone marrow failure (CBMF) disorders, it was the aim of this study to characterize chromosomally aberrant clones that arise during the clinical course of disease by means of R-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. In one child with congenital thrombocytopenia, Jacobsen syndrome [del(11)(q24)c] was diagnosed, and thus a CBMF could be excluded. In a girl with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, two independent clones, one with an isochromosome i(7)(q10), another with a complex aberrant karyotype, were identified. Simultaneously, transition into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occurred. The brother, who was also afflicted with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, showed an isochromosome i(7q) as a single aberration.  In summary, we suggest that follow-up of patients with CBMF using chromosome and FISH analyses will be helpful for the early detection of transition into MDS or AML and thus should be an integral part of the clinical management of these patients. Here we assess this capability by applying array CGH to the analysis of copy number alterations in 44 patients with a phenotype of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Twenty-five patients had the deletion on chromosome 22 characteristic of this syndrome as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  Subtelomeric aberrations previously detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were confirmed in two patients, and accurate diagnosis was provided in two previously undiagnosed complex cases. Microdeletions at 15q11.2-q13 in a newborn with hypotonia, cryptorchidism, and hypopigmentation were detected with few discrepancies between the array results and FISH analysis. Contiguous microdeletion of GSCL, HIRA and TBX1 genes at 22q11.2 was identified in a previously undiagnosed boy with an unusual presentation of the VCF/DiGeorge spectrum.  Detection of 20q(-) chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization The results showed that among 52 cases of MDS, 7 (13.5%) cases were positive by FISH, however, of which, 4 cases were positive and the other 3 cases were negative by CC assay. It is concluded that YAC912C3 and interphase FISH providing a powerful technique in the detection of 20q(-) in MDS is an important complement to CC assay. A FISH assay was performed to analyze 70 AML/MDS patients who had received conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA).  FISH is a powerful tool to identify or refine chromosomal structural aberrations involving 7q, and it provides accurate evaluation of -7/7q- in all the patients. -7 and 7q- clone frequently coexist in the same specimen, and the significantly increasing percentage of 7q- cells implies that -7 clone secondary to 7q- clone is a result from loss of 7q-. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies. We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in>80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. We clearly present that the use of SKY combined with conventional G-banding analysis and FISH has assisted in the identification of important chromosomal events that may play a key role in the development of t-MDS. n this study, we used spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as complementary techniques for the analysis of two therapy-related secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) cases with complex karyotypes, previously analyzed by G-banding.  Comparison of detection of trisomy 8 with fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional karyotype analysis in myelodysplastic syndrome The trisomy 8 clones were simultaneously detected in 48 MDS cases with FISH and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). Trisomy 8 was detected in 1 of 15 specimens with normal or abnormal karyotype without trisomy 8 by FISH. In conclusion, our results showed that FISH is a sensitive and accurate technique to detect trisomy 8 in MDS patients. It can provide contribute to diagnosis, assessment of curative effect and predicting progress of disease in MDS.  Detection of common chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome with a panel fluorescence in situ hybridization Panel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in MDS. Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (trisomy 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case) Detection of -5/5q- chromosome abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization In 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC). Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in MDS. Three cases displayed -7/7q- by conventional cytogenetics(CC) and were confirmed by interphase FISH. Six cases in 43 cases who did not show -7/7q- by CC displayed -7/7q- by interphase FISH.CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is very useful for the detection of -7 or 7q- in MDS and it is more sensitive than CC. Diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Detection of trisomy 8 with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in myelodysplastic syndromes Interphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome.  Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2.  In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing.  Discordant detection of monosomy 7 by GTG-banding and FISH in a patient with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome without evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of progenitor cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for the detection of cells affected by chromosome abnormality trisomy 8 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We conclude that the combination of FACS/FISH/BUdR, which determines the number, phenotype and proliferation rate of very rare leukaemic cells in patients with AML or MDS in clinical remission, provides information that is useful in the identification of patients with high and low likelihood of relapse. FISH detection of chromosome 15 deletions in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. We conclude that FISH analysis is a rapid and reliable method for detection of deletions within 15q11-q13 and whenever a deletion is found, FISH analysis of parental chromosomes should also be considered. We have evaluated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for the clinical laboratory detection of the 15q11-q13 deletion seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) using probes for loci D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3.  Study of clonality in myelodysplastic syndromes: detection of trisomy 8 in bone marrow cell smears by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Investigations with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrate loss of the telomeres on the reciprocal chromosome in three unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 15 in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with library probes and telomere-specific probes). Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of monosomy 7 in myelodysplastic syndromes. Detection of monosomy 7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a chromosome 7 specific alpha satellite DNA probe was used to detect monosomy 7 in interphase and metaphase cells obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). A 15-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by monosomy 7 was cytogenetically evaluated by metaphase karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of interphase cells at six different points during the course of his disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four normal relatives used as controls. These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome.  This study identified cytogenetic abnormalities in a population screened for deletion 22q11.2 syndrome (D22S) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and G-banding and correlated these abnormalities to referring specialty and submitted indications.  Positive test results for D22S FISH and other abnormalities found by other FISH assays and G-banding were correlated to submitting specialist and indication Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the diagnosis of DiGeorge sequence and related diseases. Deletions of 22q11.2 have been detected in the majority of patients with DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes by either cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or Southern blot hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization improves the detection of 5q31 deletion in myelodysplastic syndromes without cytogenetic evidence of 5q-. To explore the value of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique in the detection of the complex chromosomal aberrations (CCAs) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).M-FISH was used in ten MDS patients with R-banding CCAs to refine the complex chromosomal rearrangements, the constitute of marker chromosomes, and to identify the cryptic translocations.Thirty-seven kinds of structural rearrangements were detected by M-FISH including insertion, deletion, translocation and derivative chromosomes, among which 34 kinds were unbalanced rearrangements, and 3 were balanced rearrangements including t(6;22) (q21; q12), t(9; 19) (q13; p13) and t(3;5) (?; ?). To explore the clonal evolution of monosomy 7 in patients with aplastic anemia (AA).Monosomy 7 (-7) in 81 AA patients with normal karyotype at diagnosis and 46 AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and more than 6 months of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) were detected by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) retrospectively.There were 5.4% - 7.6% of -7 cells in 11 (13.6%) of 81 patients at diagnosis, the survival and response rate to IST in -7 positive patients did not differ significantly from that in -7 negative patients (P = 0. To compare the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) versus conventional cytogenetics (CC) in the detection of common chromosomal abnormalities and evaluate the significance of FISH in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) .A total of 344 patients with de novo MDS from June 2008 to October 2012 were detected by 6 pairs of probes, including CSF1R/D5S23-D5S721 (5q33) , EGR1/ D5S23-D5S721 (5q31) , D7S486 (7q31) /CSP7, D7S522 (7q31) /CSP7, D20S108/CSP8 (20q12/CSP8) and CSPX/CSPY Unbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21 To evaluate the conventional cytogenetic methods in genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis in the family with a proband of Angelman syndrome (AS).High-resolution G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes were performed.Two AS patients and 1 normal fetus in the family were successfully detected by FISH.Our result demonstrated that patient with type I AS could be detected by combining the techniques of high-resolution G-banding and FISH with clinical observation, which would offer accurate genetic counseling information to the geneticists and provide the prenatal diagnosis for the AS family To investigate the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndrome using chromosome 13/21 alpha satellite probe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on uncultured interphase cells from amniotic fluid.The interphase amniocytes of 10 fetuses who were detected normal and 3 fetus who were detected trisomy by prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis were selected To optimize the prenatal diagnosis platform by using domestically made fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) kit and to explore the clinical application of FISH to rapid prenatal diagnosis of a wide range of chromosomal abnormalities.Amniotic fluid samples from 110 pregnant women were studied with the rapid prenatal diagnosis method of FISH and the conventional cell culture method of karyotyping, the results from both methods were compared.Four cases of trisomy 21, 1 case of trisomy 18, 58 cases of 46, XX, and 47 cases of 46, XY were detected by FISH in the 110 amniotic fluid samples. Implementation of Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method for detecting microdeletion syndromes - our first experiences. Prenatal detection of cri du chat syndrome on uncultured amniocytes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using non-commercial probes in the diagnosis of clinically suspected microdeletion syndromes. Unbalanced translocation, t(18;21), detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a child with 18q- syndrome and a ring chromosome 21. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis. FISH with 5p subtelomeric probes and 18p subtelomeric probe further confirmed that the derivative chromosome 5 has derived from a translocation between 5p and 18p, which has given rise to a 46,XY,der(5)t(5;18)(p15.1;p11.31)dn karyotype.A de novo 5p partial deletion in conjunction with a cryptic 18p duplication has been detected in a boy featuring Cri-du-Chat syndrome. We conclude that FISH is a useful, easily applied technique for the diagnosis of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndromes, particularly DGS. In group B (n=79), the 5q deletion had been observed by cytogenetics and was confirmed to be present in all cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31.CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 detected the 5q deletion in 6% of cases without clear evidence of del(5q) by conventional banding cytogenetics. We suggest that fluorescence in situ hybridization of 5q31 should be performed in cases of a suspected '5q- syndrome' and/or if the cytogenetic study shows no metaphases or an aberrant karyotype with chromosome 5 involved (no 5q- chromosome). Although conventional cytogenetics is considered the gold standard to detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is being increasingly used additionally. Cytogenetic aberrations in myelodysplastic syndrome detected by comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. To detect chromosomal abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA). Comparison of high resolution chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the laboratory evaluation of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Deletion of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) in Prader-Willi syndrome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: two sibs with the typical phenotype without a cytogenetic deletion in chromosome 15q. We describe two sibs with typical PWS presenting deletion of SNRPN detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

589aec4778275d0c4a000037	Which are the types of viral meningitis?	Aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is characterized by meningeal inflammation that is not linked to identifiable bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The results indicate a considerable rate of herpesvirus infection in patients with aseptic meningitis, and that VZV is the most common herpesvirus to cause infection followed by HSV-1.  Detection of herpes viruses in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults with suspected viral meningitis in Malawi. Of these, 59 (32 %) had proven meningitis (bacterial, tuberculous or cryptococcal), 39 (21 %) had normal CSF and 14 (8 %) had aseptic meningitis. For the latter group, a herpes virus was detected in 9 (64 %): 7 (50 %) had EBV and 2 (14 %) had CMV, all were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive.  Results confirm that EV-specific RT-PCR can detect HRVs, and at a practical level, identify potential problems of interpretation if fecal samples are used for surrogate screening in cases of suspected viral meningitis.  Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can be divided into three species; HRV-A to HRV-C. Enteroviruses (EV) and parechoviruses (HPeV) are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and sepsis-like syndrome in neonates. Serous meningitis associated with primary genital herpes infection Aseptic meningitis is not an uncommon complication to primary genital herpes infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compared with other types of viral meningitis, HSV-2-meningitis is associated with a significant rate of neurological complications in the acute stage. In addition, some patients will suffer from recurrent aseptic meningitis (Mollaret's meningitis) later. We describe six patients, five women and one man, age 26-35 years, with aseptic meningitis caused by HSV-2. Viral meningitis due to echovirus types 6 and 9: epidemiological data from Western Australia. During the autumn of 1992, Western Australia experienced a large viral meningitis outbreak of dual aetiology.  Echovirus 9 caused 41% of cases and occurred mainly in the metropolitan areas of Western Australia whereas echovirus 6, which caused 37% of cases, was more widespread.  Sensitive virologic evaluation in suspected meningitis: study of a radioimmunotest for the detection of IgM antibodies against ECHO 9 and ECHO 11 viruses The majority of viral meningitis cases is known to be due to ECHO virus infections on one hand, and mumps on the other.  The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus which is transmitted to man by means of different species of mosquitoes and causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of illness in different regions of the Old World, including the Mediterranean Basin. Bearing in mind the high percentage of neurological complications found to exist in the most recent outbreaks of WNV infections recorded in the Mediterranean Basin (Bucharest, Algeria), it can be thought that the WNV plays some role in the factors contributing to viral meningitis and encephalitis which occur within the population of the areas at risk within Spain. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). We compared data obtained from patients with mumps meningitis and patients with aseptic meningitis caused by other viruses in order to identify mumps meningitis-specific cytokine/chemokine alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).METHODS:   We elucidated the cytokine/chemokine network based on the cytokine/chemokine profiles in CSF from children with mumps meningitis and meningitis due to other viral infections using multiplex cytokine measurement.

58a0c09778275d0c4a000052	What are the different classes of orally administered drugs used to treat diabetes	 achieved by selectively inhibiting sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). After a decade-long effort to improve the pharmacokinetics of GLP1, a number of GLP1 analogues are currently available on the market  short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists exenatide and lixisenatide.   Sulphonylurea (SU) drugs have a history stretching back over 60 years, and have traditionally been the mainstay choice as second-line agents to be added to metformin once glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy deteriorates; In 2013, sulfonylureas were the most common second-line treatment after metformin i this position was taken by DPP-4 inhibitors [Studies on resorption of orally administered antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents in children and its modification. The drugs used to treat diabetes mellitus are diverse and include several classes. Many of the therapeutic agents used to treat diabetes mellitus have the ability to lower blood glucose to dangerous concentrations; these include the sulfonylurea, meglitinide, and thiazolidinedione drug classes. The most common therapeutic classes of drugs used in all participating regions, in the previous week, were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, metabolic (including drugs to treat diabetes) and nervous system. Use of oral antidiabetic agents, by drug class, did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity (p = 0.33 for TZDs, p = 0.43 for metformin, p = 0.38 for sulfonylureas).  The use of these drugs was also common among insulin treated diabetics but did not differ significantly from among non-diabetics.  Drug use among those treated with insulin and those treated orally was substantially higher than among non-diabetics while the difference between diabetics on dietary regimen and non-diabetics was much smaller.  UNLABELLED: The aims of the study were to evaluate differences in dietary, oral hygiene habits and social class in children with Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), compared to non-diabetics, and to investigate relationship between selected caries-risk factors and caries experience in diabetics.  Vildagliptin is a potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4), orally active, that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) primarily by enhancing pancreatic (alpha and beta) islet function. The literature covered includes original studies and meta-analyses identified in PubMed, recent abstracts presented at major diabetes scientific conferences, and clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.Although there are some differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the different DPP-4 inhibitors, all are small orally active compounds with broadly similar HbA1c-lowering efficacy. The authors conclude that rosiglitazone can be safely administered with metformin and, due to the different mechanisms of action of these agents, may offer a therapeutic advantage in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are different classes of anti-diabetic drugs reported to treat diabetes. There are now four different classes of oral medications which are available to treat diabetes-sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. During followup, incident treated diabetes was defined as a self-report of a new physician diagnosis of diabetes treated with insulin or oral drugs. This systematic review will compare adherence and persistence rates across the different classes of medication available to people with type 2 diabetes. Five classes of oral hypoglycaemic drugs and two trace minerals used to treat diabetes mellitus in humans are reviewed and current knowledge on the use of these drugs in diabetic dogs and cats is presented. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. Currently, four classes of orally administered antidiabetic agents are available for use in patients with type 2 diabetes: insulin secretagogues, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones.

5884fe4ce56acf5176000010	SPAG5 was implicated in which cancers?	BACKGROUND: We conducted multiple microarray datasets analyses from clinical and xenograft tumor tissues to search for disease progression-driving oncogenes in prostate cancer (PCa). Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) attracted our attention. SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression. CONCLUSION: Our results collectively showed a progression-driving role of SPAG5 in PCa which can be regulated by miR-539, suggesting that miR-539/SPAG5 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa. RESULTS: We identified that SPAG5 expression was gradually increased in PCa progression and its level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence. Our results indicated that SPAG5 knockdown can drastically inhibit PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and supress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.  miR-539 inhibits prostate cancer progression by directly targeting SPAG5. SPAG5 as a prognostic biomarker and chemotherapy sensitivity predictor in breast cancer: a retrospective, integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and protein analysis. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR]1·50, 95% CI 1·18-1·92, p=0·00010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1·68, 1·40-2·01, p<0·0001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1·68, 1·32-2·12, p<0·0001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1·62, 95% CI 1·03-2·53, p=0·036; METABRIC: 1·27, 1·02-1·58, p=0·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2·34, 1·24-4·42, p=0·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1·73, 1·23-2·46, p=0·0020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·20-0·60, p=0·0010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0·68, 95% CI 0·48-0·97, p=0·031).  INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. SPAG5 upregulation predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients and alters sensitivity to taxol treatment via the mTOR signaling pathway. Previously, we found that sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) was upregulated in pelvic lymph node metastasis-positive cervical cancer. In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in cervical cancer. RESULTS: We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC, including SPAG5, POLH, KIF23, and RAD54L, which are associated with mitotic spindle formation, DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and dsDNA break repair, respectively. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. In our study, SPAG5 expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays.  In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0·37, 95% CI 0·20-0·60, p=0·0010). We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), N In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1·62, 95% CI 1·03-2·53, p=0·036; METABRIC: 1·27, 1·02-1·58, p=0·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2·34, 1·24-4·42, p=0·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1·73, 1·23-2·46, p=0·0020). THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. Furthermore, men with THY1 positive breast cancers had significantly inferior survival. THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. SPAG5 was recently identified as an oncogene participating in lung cancer and cervical cancer progression. SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer.

58a80bc838c171fb5b000001	List kinases that phosphorylates the protein Bora.	During cell division Bora becomes multiply phosphorylated by a variety of cell cycle kinases, including Aurora A and Plk1, albeit at distinctive sites. Likewise, we find that phosphorylation of Bora by Cdk1 promotes phosphorylation of human Plk1 by Aurora A suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in humans.  we show that the master mitotic kinase Cdk1 contributes to Plk1 activation through SPAT-1/Bora phosphorylation the potential role of Bora phosphorylation by Cdk1 in this process phosphorylation of Bora on the Cdk consensus site T52 blocks Bora degradation.

58a94483ee23e0236b000003	Which fimA genotypes are associated with disease?	 FimA has been characterized as an important virulence factor for P. gingivalis, and many studies, both animal experiments and clinical investigations, have characterized fimA genotypes II, Ib, and IV to be associated with disease (periodontitis and cardiovascular disease)  Long fimbriae (FimA) are important virulence factors of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Based on the diversity of the fimA gene, this species is classified into 6 genotypes.   In cases of chronic apical periodontitis, P. gingivalis variant type IV was the most prevalent (24%), followed by types I (20%), II (16%), and III (8%). In acute abscess samples, variant type II was the most prevalent (12%), followed by types III and IV (8% of each) and type I (4%). We show that P. gingivalis strains with genotype I and II of FimA are efficient in interaction with saliva or S. gordonii.  A strong association between Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib and chronic periodontitis exists in the Spanish population. The most prevalent genotype in periodontal patients is II. Our results suggest that the presence of P. gingivalis is associated with periodontal diseases, and that the type II, IV and Ib/II combination are the most common among fimA genotypes. Statistical analysis, however, revealed that a more significant correlation was found between periodontitis and the occurrence of type Ib fimA.  Type II of fimA was the most prevalent genotype of P. gingivalis in patients with AgP.  The population of Tregs further decreased in patients with type II FimA compared with the other types. P.gingivlias FimA genotype II was the dominant type associated with decreased Treg population.  A trend toward a greater frequency of FimA II genotype in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis was determined. The fimA type Ib genotype of P. gingivalis was found to play a critical role in the destruction of peri-implant tissue, suggesting that it may be a distinct risk factor for peri-implantitis.

Both types of changes in kinetics result in increased channel activity in response to a given mechanical stimulus, suggesting that Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2. Here, we describe two distinct PIEZO2 mutations in patients with a subtype of Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 characterized by generalized autosomal dominant contractures with limited eye movements, restrictive lung disease, and variable absence of cruciate knee ligaments. Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). In contrast, heterozygous gain-of-function missense mutations, mainly localized at the C terminus, cause dominant distal arthrogryposis 3 (DA3), distal arthrogryposis 5 (DA5), or Marden-Walker syndrome (MWKS), which encompass contractures of hands and feet, scoliosis, ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis. Dominant mutations in PIEZO2, which codes for the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception and touch sensation, have been found to cause different forms of distal arthrogryposi	[['Gordon syndrome'], ['distal arthrogryposis type 5'], ['Marden-Walker syndrome']]

589dee3778275d0c4a000050	What genes are drug targets for Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP)?	 Recently, FOP has been associated with a specific mutation of ACVR1, the gene coding for a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor.  Small molecule inhibitors of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor kinase ALK2 (ACVR1) are needed urgently to treat the progressively debilitating musculoskeletal disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Dorsomorphin analogues, first identified in zebrafish, remain the only BMP inhibitor chemotype reported to date. By screening an assay panel of 250 recombinant human kinases we identified a highly selective 2-aminopyridine-based inhibitor K02288 with in vitro activity against ALK2 at low nanomolar concentrations similar to the current lead compound LDN-193189 Here, it is noted that if B cells are found to be the lymphocytes responsible for excess BMP-4 production in FOP, use of Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which effectively targets B cells, could be a less permanent and less risky treatment alternative for FOP.

These mutations represent new targets for therapeutic intervention in this otherwise incurable disease. In this study, we examined downstream signaling targets to study the BMP-Smad and BMP-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in FOP.  Mutations in the ACVR1 gene are associated with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a rare and extremely disabling disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and progressive heterotopic endochondral ossification in muscles and other non-skeletal tissues.  Linkage exclusion and mutational analysis of the noggin gene in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disorder characterized by progressive ossification of connective tissue, is caused by an activating mutation in Acvr1 (the gene that encodes ACVR1/ALK2). This gene encodes the type I bone morphogenic protein receptor ALK2, with the residues affected identical to those that, when mutated in the germline, give rise to the congenital malformation syndrome fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), resulting in the transformation of soft tissue into bone.

588f220e3b87a8a73800000d	List available circular RNA prediction tools.	CircRNAs are novel members of the non-coding RNA family. For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated. Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions.

METHODS: Outcomes of surgery, prognostic factors for survival, and relevance of Tomita and Tokuhashi scores were investigated. PURPOSE: To assess variability in the use of Tomita and modified Bauer scores in spine metastases. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.  .CONCLUSION: The Tomita scoring system represents a practicable and highly predictive prognostic tool.  Analysis of the predictive role and new proposal for surgical strategies based on the modified Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems for spinal metastasis. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems.  CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores.  A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis.  It is for this reason that scoring systems, such as the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, have been created The modified Tokuhashi score had better accuracy in determining actual survival. Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so. Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi score independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases.  Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery. A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery. Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease. Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis. Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC.Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution.The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC.The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems.Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis The data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases A retrospective study of 180 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases, wherein prognostic score-predicted survival was compared with actual survival.To evaluate and compare the accuracy of prognostic scoring systems in lung cancer spinal metastases.The modified Tokuhashi, Tomita, modified Bauer, and Oswestry scores are currently used to guide decisions regarding operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases.

A history of side effects was reported by 40 (19.5%) of the patients, and mainly consisted of muscle complaints and gastrointestinal symptoms.  Treatment Options for Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms. Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment. At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).  Muscle problems and other adverse symptoms associated with statin use are frequent reasons for non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy, which results in inadequate control of hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk.  It was estimated that rosuvastatin-associated absolute hazards of muscle-, liver- and renal-related adverse effects are lower than the corresponding vascular benefits in moderate vascular risk individuals.  Rosuvastatin-induced proteinuria appears to be of tubular origin, not relating to kidney injury. Rosuvastatin increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by dose-dependently impairing insulin sensitivity.  Statins are associated with myopathy, transaminase elevations, and an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus among some patients; connections between statins and other processes, such as renal and neurologic function, have also been studied with mixed results.  Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment.This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search, and on the current recommendations of the European Atherosclerosis Society.At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Nevertheless, patients may develop side effects such as muscle pain and weakness years after starting statin therapy; however, the absolute number of patients affected by statin myopathy increases with treatment duration. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in statin-induced myopathy may help identify patient groups susceptible to statins' side effects, thereby increasing their safety..

588f952994c1512c50000007	What are clinical features of the de Morsier syndrome?	 SOD was formerly known as de Morsier syndrome, which associated a midline brain defect such as an absent septum pellucidum with optic nerve hypoplasia. The triad consists of optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and midline brain defects, although it can vary in the severity of clinical presentation and phenotype.  INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have described septooptic dysplasia (SOD) to describe patients who have optic nerve hypoplasia, the absence of septum pellucidum, and pituitary hypoplasia. BACKGROUND: Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.  Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), otherwise called De Morsier syndrome, is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities).  The frequently associated features of hypopituitarism and absent septum pellucidum were felt to have embryonic linkage as "septo-optic dysplasia" or "de Morsier's syndrome." An MRI of the brain demonstrated the absence of the septum pellucidum, which confirmed a diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia or de Morsier syndrome. Septo-optic dysplasia (De Morsier syndrome) is a developmental anomaly of mid-line brain structures and includes optic nerve hypoplasia, absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamo-pituitary abnormalities. Septo-optic dysplasia, also known as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital entity almost always characterized by hypoplasia/dysplasia of the optical nerve, chiasma or optic radiations and the complete or partial absence of the septum pellucidum. The de Morsier syndrome, or septo-optic dysplasia, is a developmental anomaly characterized by involvement of the optic system, hypothalamic-pituitary axis and septum pellucidum. The term septooptic dysplasia was coined in 1956 by de Morsier, who pointed out the association of optic nerve hypoplasia and absence of the septum pellucidum. Septo-optic dysplasia, also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), also referred to as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital condition, characterized by two of the classic triad features: midline brain abnormalities, optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and pituitary endocrine dysfunction.

58adb9919ef3c34033000004	Which proteins form part of the NRD complex in S. cerevisiae?	This activity is derived from the CHD3 and CHD4 proteins which contain helicase/ATPase domains found in SWI2-related chromatin remodelling factors, and facilitates the deacetylation of oligonucleosomal histones in vitro. We refer to this complex as the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylating (NRD) complex Molecular association between ATR and two components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating complex, HDAC2 and CHD4 The purification of an ATR complex allowed identification of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an ATR-associated protein by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. CHD4 (also called Mi-2beta) is a component of a histone-deacetylase-2 (HDAC2)-containing complex, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NRD) complex Endogenous ATR, CHD4, and HDAC2 are shown to coimmunoprecipitate, and ATR and HDAC2 coelute through two biochemical purification steps. Other members of the NRD complex, HDAC1, MTA1, and MTA2, are also detectable in ATR immunoprecipitates. Sen1 of S. cerevisiae is a known component of the NRD complex implicated in transcription termination of nonpolyadenylated as well as some polyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts.  We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID).

58c6a6c502b8c60953000027	Which are the typical symptoms of Ménière's disease?	To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in Ménière's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear. We suggest that a 3T MRI measurement should be carried out in patients with sensory-neural hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, 4 h after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-contrast agent to verify the inner ear pathology.  Eleven of the 17425 veterans appeared to have typical Ménière's Disease. Their symptoms included attacks of vertigo, lasting between half an hour and a few hours and no more than 24 hours; the sensation of aural fullness; and tinnitus accompanied by a fluctuating or permanent low-tone hearing loss.  Diagnosis of Menière's Disease is based upon the wellknown labyrinthic syndrome (hypoacusia, tinnitus and dizziness) which manifests with the typical abscessual, recurrent and unforeseeable course.  Typical clinical manifestations of Ménière's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group. Among 93 patients presenting the typical symptoms of a Ménière's disease associating an unilateral fluctuating hearing loss of sensorineural type, tinnitus and vertiginous attacks lasting minutes to hours, 40 patients (43%) presented in their personal history a particular otologic insult in the ear which later on developed into the full Ménière's symptomatology, or a particular systemic disease with otologic manifestations.  Fourteen children (aged 14 years or younger) with typical Ménière's triad with cochlear sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent vertigo attacks lasting from minutes to hours were investigated in four different neuro-otologic centers.

To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in Ménières disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear.Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups.Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish Ménière Association in Finland In monosymptomatic patients with vertigo, tinnitus or hearing loss; EH was demonstrated in 55-90% of the patients either in the cochlea and/or the vestibulum of the symptomatic ear.Ménières disease often shows bilateral EH and comprises a continuum from a monosymptomatic disease to the typical symptom complex of the disease Typical clinical manifestations of Ménière's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group.  Nine children, labeled as having "idiopathic Ménière's disease," developed the auditory and vestibular symptoms without any detectable causative factor. To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in Ménière's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear.Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups.Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish Ménière Association in Finland. In each twin pair, one twin had migraine and Ménière's disease, whereas the other experienced migraine and episodic vertigo without auditory symptoms.The frequent association of episodic vertigo, migraine, and Ménière's disease in closely related individuals, including identical twins supports the heritability of a migraine-Ménière's syndrome, with variable expression of the individual features of hearing loss, episodic vertigo, and migraine headaches. There has been literature, beginning with Ménière himself, suggesting a relationship between Ménière's disease and migraine-associated dizziness. In the characterizations of the migraine-associated dizziness, the signs and symptoms show overlap with those characterizing Meniere's disease.

Clinically approved inhibitors were selected as well as several other reported metalloprotein inhibitors in order to represent a broad range of metal binding groups (MBGs), including hydroxamic acid, carboxylate, hydroxypyridinonate, thiol, and N-hydroxyurea functional groups. A total of 21 different raltegravir-chelator derivative (RCD) compounds were prepared that differed only in the nature of the MBG.  At least two compounds (RCD-4, RCD-5) containing a hydroxypyrone MBG were found to display superior strand-transfer inhibition when compared to an abbreviated analogue of raltegravir (RCD-1).  By screening a library of metalloenzyme inhibitors, the N-formyl-hydroxylamine derivative BB-3497 was identified as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli peptide deformylase with antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo.  The 8-hydroxyquinoline represents a promising new chelator scaffold for the development of MMP inhibitors that was discovered by use of a metalloprotein-focused chelator fragment library.  the metalloenzyme inhibitors VT-1129 and VT-1161 (both Viamet Pharmaceuticals) Based on their ability to chelate metals, hydroxamate molecules and siderophores have been successfully used as metalloenzyme inhibitors.  Using this model, we identified two nitrogen donor compounds--2,2'-dipyridylamine (DPA) and triazacyclononane (TACN)--as the most selective ZBGs for zinc metalloenzyme inhibitor development.

Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation.

58b548d722d3005309000005	Which bacteria cause diphtheria?	Corynebacterium ulcerans is a zoonotic pathogen that can produce diphtheria toxin and causes an illness categorized as diphtheria in the European Union because its clinical appearance is similar to that of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  The zoonotic bacterium Corynebacterium ulcerans may be pathogenic both in humans and animals: toxigenic strains can cause diphtheria or diphtheria-like disease in humans via diphtheria toxin, while strains producing the dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase D may lead to caseous lymphadenitis primarily in wild animals. Diphtheria toxin-positive Corynebacterium ulcerans strains have been isolated mainly from cattle, dogs and cats. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria, has been performed.  Corynebacterium ulcerans 0102 carries the gene encoding diphtheria toxin on a prophage different from the C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129 prophage. Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin. Acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of C. ulcerans and C. diphtheriae.  Corynebacterium ulcerans (toxigenic C. ulcerans) produces the diphtheria toxin, which causes pharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria-like disease in people, and this bacterium is commonly detected in dogs and cats that are reared at home.  This case demonstrates that strains of C. ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment. Diphtheria is a serious upper respiratory tract disease caused by the diphtheria toxin (DT) secreted from the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae. ulcerans produce diphtheria toxin, which can cause life-threatening cardiopathies and neuropathies in humans. A high-density growth approach was utilized to produce mutated diphtheria toxin from two strains of Corynebacterium diphtheria: C7 (beta)(tox-201,tox-9) and C7 (beta)(tox-107). For the primary prevention of disease caused by diphtheria toxin-producing corynebacteria, vaccination with diphtheria toxoid is recommended. ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment.

Laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of infections caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and C. ulcerans.  A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway.  A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway. In cases of human infection with potentially toxigenic corynebacteria, it is important to determine the species and examine the isolate for diphtheria toxin production. AIM: Study of the apoptogenic effect of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxigenic strains on mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation ofapoptosis induced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes strains was performed by characteristic morphological changes in macrophages in smears stained by azure eosin by Romanovsky-Giemsa.RESULTS: Apoptogenic activity of diphtheria infectious agent was established to be determined by diphtheria exotoxin at early (after 1 hour) and surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes at later (3 hours) stages of effect.CONCLUSION: The ability of diphtheria infectious agent to cause macrophage apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of realization of its pathogenic properties determined by the effect of diphtheria exotoxin, as well as its surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes. Extrapharyngeal infections caused by Corynebacterium ulcerans have rarely been reported previously, and diphtheria toxin production has usually not been addressed. Corynebacterium ulcerans may cause diphtheria in humans and caseous lymphadenitis in animals. ulcerans for the first time, we show that related sequence types (STs) might be associated with the presence of the diphtheria toxin gene, which encodes diphtheria toxin (DT), the most important diphtheria-causing virulence factor. Human-to-human-transmitted Corynebacterium diphtheriae was historically the main pathogen causing diphtheria and has therefore been studied extensively in the past. Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the organism causing diphtheria, was thought to have become rare or even have disappeared from previously endemic areas such as South Dakota.

METHODS: We analyzed patients from ARISTOTLE, a randomized trial of 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation comparing the effects of apixaban versus warfarin on the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.   In this study we evaluated the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers at baseline and future risk of cardiovascular events in the Apixaban for Reduction In Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial.METHODS: The ARISTOTLE trial randomised 18,201 patients with AF to apixaban or warfarin. Moreover, apixaban was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99) although this finding was driven by the results of the ARISTOTLE trial. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF.

58c1b2f702b8c6095300001e	List 3 indications for Bupropion	 For genotype, genes associated with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and related proteins have been found to predict response to first-line medications (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, or varenicline) or quitting over time without a controlled treatment trial.  The approval of drug combinations, such as phentermine/topiramate and bupropion/naltrexone are also noteworthy, the components of which have been previously approved, but not necessarily for obesity as main indication. Two drugs, phentermine plus topiramate and lorcaserin, have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the indication of obesity; a third, bupropion plus naltrexone, is under consideration for approval.  Bupropion SR is preferred to subjects with depression or smokers who have failed with the previous two agents, due to the many contra-indications and side effects of bupropion SR. With one of the 3 agents combined with follow-up visits with counselling, one can expect a 1-year quit rate around 20-25%. In vitro intrinsic clearances were likewise different for bupropion enantiomers.CONCLUSIONS: Stereoselective bupropion hydroxylation may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of bupropion as an antidepressant or smoking cessation therapy, and for the use of bupropion as an in vivo phenotypic probe for CYP2B6 activity. PURPOSE: Hydroxylation of the antidepressant and smoking deterrent drug bupropion is a clinically important bioactivation and elimination pathway. Although not U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for these indications, bupropion has also been used as an adjunctive treatment to reverse antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction and to augment anti-depressant efficacy in partial responders and non-responders to other agents.Bupropion has played and will continue to play an important role as a treatment for major depressive disorder in adults, as well as for other related disorders Clinically, bupropion is used as a treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent Sustained release bupropion (amfebutamone) is a non-nicotine agent that is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation.  Bupropion was introduced for smoking cessation following a pivotal trial showing that it gave improved efficacy over the nicotine patch and also suggesting combination treatment was beneficial.  Compared with a placebo control, bupropion approximately doubles smoking quit rates.  Over the past decade, bupropion has become a major pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the Western world. Unlike other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, bupropion is a non-nicotine treatment Bupropion has been tested in over 40 controlled clinical trials and has been associated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events than NRTs.  Bupropion SR is a useful oral and non-nicotine form of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. everal new drugs for the treatment of obesity are either licensed in some parts of the world, submitted for registration, or completing phase III trials.

The introduced profiles represent an 83% expansion and 10% update when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence. Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles.

58add1d79ef3c34033000008	Which driver mutations have been identified for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)?	We found conservation of heterozygous K27M mutations in H3F3A (n = 4) or HIST1H3B (n = 3) across all primary, contiguous, and metastatic tumor sites in all DIPGs ACVR1 (n = 2), PIK3CA (n = 2), FGFR1 (n = 2), and MET (n = 1) were also intra-tumorally conserved  TP53 aberrations (n = 3 patients) varied by type and location between primary and metastatic tumors sites but were intra-tumorally conserved. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M--including H3.2K27M--mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (TP53/PPM1D) or specific growth factor pathways (ACVR1/PIK3R1).  Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Moreover, in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), recurrent somatic mutations of ACVR1 were found in association with HIST1H3B mutations Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recurrent mutations within the histone H3 genes H3F3A and HIST1H3B that convert K27 to methionine (H3K27M) and disrupt the global H3K27 methylation landscape and PRC2-dependent silencing, have recently been identified in pediatric high-grade gliomas including Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; Type IV glioma). Sequencing analysis showed c.83A>T mutations in the H3F3A or HIST1H3B gene in 77 % of our DIPG cohort.

58dfd83a6fddd3e83e000003	List genes associated with hypolipidemia.	 Conversely familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is caused by inactivation of the PCSK9 gene which increases the number of LDL receptors and decreases plasma cholesterol. Mutations in the genes APOB, and ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 (that encode angiopoietin-like proteins which inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity) can further cause low levels of apoB containing lipoproteins Several mutations in the apoB, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and MTP genes result in low or absent levels of apoB and LDL-cholesterol in plasma, which cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia. Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia.  Mutations of the ANGPTL3 gene have been associated with a novel form of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia, the combined hypolipidemia (cHLP), characterized by low total cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol levels.  These results demonstrated that in a cohort of subjects with severe primary hypobetalipoproteinemia the prevalence of ANGPTL3 gene mutations responsible for a combined hypolipidemia phenotype is about 10%, whereas mutations of APOB gene are absent. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum.

58c6665602b8c60953000024	Which are the symptoms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency) is the most common red blood cell (RBC) enzyme disorder. The decrease as well as the absence of the enzyme increase RBC vulnerability to oxidative stress caused by exposure to certain medications or intake of fava beans. Among the most common clinical manifestations of this condition, acute hemolysis, chronic hemolysis, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and an asymptomatic form are observed. Red blood cells carry oxygen in the body and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase protects these cells from oxidative chemicals. If there is a lack of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, red blood cells can go acute hemolysis. Convulsion is a rare presentation for acute hemolysis due to Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency.  By far the most common form worldwide is the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency. In the most frequent variants of this disease hemolysis occurs only during stress, imposed for example by infection, "oxidative" drugs or after ingestion of fava beans. The most serious clinical complication of the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency is the rarely observed neonatal icterus. Some enzyme variants can cause chronic hemolysis which is described as chronic nonsperocytic hemolytic anemia.  One limitation of primaquine is that, at certain doses, primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PDd) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common human enzymopathy that affects cellular redox status and may lower flux into nonoxidative pathways of glucose metabolism The 6PGD deficiency was associated with a variable reticulocyte count and recurrent increased unconjugated bilirubinemia without anemia in the propositus, while no clinical or hematological symptoms were evident in her mother. The authors of this article make 5 particular recommendations: (1) Anyone suspected of G6PD deficiency should be screened; (2) exposure to oxidative stressors in these individuals should be avoided; (3) these patients should be informed of risks along with signs and symptoms of an acute hemolytic crisis; (4) the clinician should be able to identify both laboratory and clinical signs of hemolysis; and finally, (5) if an acute hemolytic crisis is identified, the patient should be admitted for close observation and care. None of the patients with or without G6PD deficiency showed symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings indicating hemolysis before administration of the drug and 4 days thereafter. Kinetic and electrophoretic properties of 230--300 fold purified preparations of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from red cells of donors and patients with acute drug hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency were studied. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder in which haemolytic anaemia is the major symptom. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, its use is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (risk for haemolytic anaemia). The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the development of stroke in children with SCA is controversial. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive hemolytic anemia caused by a mutation in the G6PD gene on Xq28.

Perioperative management of the patient with LVNC might be challenging due to the clinical symptoms of heart failure, systemic thromboembolic events, and fatal left ventricular arrhythmias. Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a rare type of congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by prematurely arrested compaction of the endocardial and myocardial fibers and the progressive deterioration of left ventricular contractility.  Clinical features associated with LVNC vary in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and include the potential for heart failure, conduction defects (eg, left bundle branch block), supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and sudden cardiac death.  The clinical presentations are variable ranging from asymptomatic patients to patients who develop ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  The clinical presentation and the natural history of LVNC are highly variable, ranging from no symptoms to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic thromboemboli.  The clinical manifestations of the disease are variable, ranging from no symptoms to signs of heart failure, systemic emboli, and ventricular arrhythmias.  We describe the case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of heart failure secondary to left ventricular noncompaction. Multiple left ventricular thrombi in a patient with left ventricular noncompaction. We present three children with myocardial noncompaction: one male with isolated left ventricular noncompaction, another with right ventricular noncompaction and dysplastic tricuspid valve, and the last with left ventricular noncompaction, ventricular septal defect and coarctation of aorta, to stress especially the different clinical forms of the disorder and the importance of early diagnosis, as it may result in a fatal outcome.

58d8d8108acda34529000009	Which mutated genes are associated with isolated ectopia lentis?	A founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 causes early-onset bilateral ectopia lentis among Jews of Bukharian origin. The term isolated ectopia lentis (EL; subluxation or dislocation of the human crystalline lens) is applied to patients with EL, without skeletal features and in the absence of aortic root dilatation. To date, the only gene shown to cause autosomal-recessive isolated EL is ADAMTSL4. Here we report a novel founder mutation in ADAMTSL4 gene in children of Bukharian Jewish origin presenting with early-onset bilateral EL.  Early onset ectopia lentis due to a FBN1 mutation with non-penetrance. Isolated ectopia lentis is usually autosomal dominant and commonly due to the mutations of FBN1 gene.  In conclusion, we report on a case of early-onset autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis caused by FBN1 mutation that has previously been reported only in Marfan syndrome. ADAMTSL4-associated isolated ectopia lentis: Further patients, novel mutations and a detailed phenotype description. ADAMTSL4 mutations seem to be the most common cause of isolated ectoplia lentis (EL) and thus are important concerning the differential diagnosis of connective tissue syndromes with EL as main feature.  A genotype-phenotype comparison of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 in isolated ectopia lentis. To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene. A novel FBN1 mutation in a Chinese family with isolated ectopia lentis. To identify the genetic defect in an autosomal dominant isolated ectopia lentis (EL) family. A novel mutation of FBN1 results in an arginine to cysteine residue (p.R974C) substitution, which is responsible for the patients with isolated EL in this Chinese family.

5880b2a6c872c95565000004	Signaling of which pathways is inhibited by Dupilumab?	This study reviewed all studies about any roles of IL-4 that can directly and indirectly be played in the development of pemphigus and IL-4 inhibition with interferons and dupilumab therapy were introduced as a novel pemphigus treatment for patients who are in relapse phase of the disease. Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus. It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 α-chain receptor.  OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis. BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.  Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.  The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication "atopic dermatitis" were published in 2014. An IL-4R antagonist, dupilumab, is the first drug that shows great promise in phase II trials.  Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis.  Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor α subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways. Dupilumab inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in asthma. Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. The robust effects of dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2 cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease. Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.

Long-term forecasting and comparison of mortality in the Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus Eluting Stent vs. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial: prospective validation of the SYNTAX Score II. AIMS: To prospectively validate the SYNTAX Score II and forecast the outcomes of the randomized Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) Trial. Based on 4-year mortality predictions in EXCEL, clinical characteristics shifted long-term mortality predictions either in favour of PCI (older age, male gender and COPD) or CABG (younger age, lower creatinine clearance, female gender, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction). Given that the completed randomized trials did not include contemporary DESs, the upcoming results of the ongoing trials evaluating the performance of new-generation DES compared with CABG (such as the EXCEL trial), may further help to clarify the current role and future recommendations of PCI for left main coronary artery disease.  The ongoing EXCEL trial will help elucidate the role of ULMCA PCI in the treatment of left main disease compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The ongoing Evaluation of XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Stent System Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is expected to provide a better answer on the optimal treatment strategy for LMCAD patients.  The Evaluation of Xience Prime or Xience V versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is a multicenter, ongoing trial conducted in patients with left main disease and SYNTAX score ≤ 32 to establish the presumptive advantage of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus bypass surgery in patients with less complex coronary artery disease than those enrolled in the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial.  The EXCEL trial will address the value of PCI in relation to CABG for the treatment of ULMCA stenosis in more than 2000 patients.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to verify the study hypothesis of the EXCEL trial by comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in an EXCEL-like population of patients.BACKGROUND: The upcoming EXCEL trial will test the hypothesis that left main patients with SYNTAX score ≤ 32 experience similar rates of 3-year death, myocardial infarction (MI), or cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) following revascularization by PCI or CABG. CONCLUSIONS: In an EXCEL-like cohort of patients with left main disease, there seems to be a clinical equipoise between PCI and CABG in terms of death/MI/CVA.  The aim of this study is to verify the study hypothesis of the EXCEL trial by comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in an EXCEL-like population of patients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to verify the study hypothesis of the EXCEL trial by comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in an EXCEL-like population of patients.BACKGROUND: The upcoming EXCEL trial will test the hypothesis that left main patients with SYNTAX score ? The results of the ongoing EXCEL trial, which compares left main percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents and CABG, will provide insight regarding the ideal revascularization strategy for these patients.. Given that the completed randomized trials did not include contemporary DESs, the upcoming results of the ongoing trials evaluating the performance of new-generation DES compared with CABG (such as the EXCEL trial), may further help to clarify the current role and future recommendations of PCI for left main coronary artery disease. The introduction of the newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) -with documented improvements in both safety and efficacy- has prompted the interventional community to design two new dedicated randomised trials comparing CABG and PCI: the NOBLE (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Vs Drug Eluting Stent Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty in the Treatment of Unprotected Left Main Stenosis) and EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE Everolimus Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trials. The EXCEL trial will address the value of PCI in relation to CABG for the treatment of ULMCA stenosis in more than 2000 patients.

58add7699ef3c34033000009	Which proteins does the yeast Cleavage and Polyadenylation Complex contain?	Gene loops have been described in different organisms from yeast to human and form through interaction between components of the transcription pre-initiation complex and Ssu72, a member of the 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation complex A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major poly(A) polymerase Pap1 produces mRNA 3' ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated snoRNAs in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome. Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6 A more important role of Trf4/TRAMP, however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with snoRNA genes. Screening crude natural product extracts with this technology has resulted in the identification of a novel family of antifungal natural products, named the parnafungins, which inhibit the enzyme polyadenosine polymerase (PAP), a key component of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex. We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3' cleavage and polyadenylation comple We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts. Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity.

DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics.  in this paper, we use recent state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods and develop a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture, called EP-DNN, to predict the presence and types of enhancers in the human genome. In this paper, we developed EP-DNN, which has high accuracy of prediction, with validation rates above 90 % for the operational region of enhancer prediction for all four cell lines that we studied, outperforming DEEP-ENCODE and RFECS We present EP-DNN, a protocol for predicting enhancers based on chromatin features, in different cell types. Specifically, we use a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture to extract enhancer signatures in a representative human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and a differentiated lung cell type (IMR90) We find that EP-DNN has superior accuracy with a validation rate of 91.6%, relative to 85.3% for DEEP-ENCODE and 85.5% for RFECS, for a given number of enhancer predictions and also scales better for a larger number of enhancer predictions.

5883a25d7ffa0d4374000001	What are the roles of Smyd3 in zebrafish?	Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. In addition, these phenotypes were associated with abnormal expression of three heart-chamber markers including cmlc2, amhc and vmhc, and abnormal expression of myogenic regulatory factors including myod and myog. These data suggest that Smyd3 plays an important role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle. We here show that transcripts of smyd3 were expressed in zebrafish embryos at all developmental stages examined and that knockdown of smyd3 in embryos resulted in pericardial edema and defects in the trunk structure. We find both smyd3 and setd7 are highly expressed within developing zebrafish heart and knock-down of these genes led to severe defects in cardiac morphogenesis without altering the expressions pattern of heart markers, including cmlc2, vmhc, and amhc. Smyd3 is required for the development of cardiac and skeletal muscle in zebrafish. SMYD1, SMYD2, SMYD3, and SMYD4 have been found to play critical roles in carcinogenesis and/or the development of heart and skeletal muscle.

58a6c94860087bc10a00002a	Which histone mutations have been associated with pediatric gliomas?	Detecting the H3F3A mutant allele found in high-grade pediatric glioma by real-time PCR  It has been reported recently that about 80% of DIPG cases and 70% of midline glioblastomas contain a mutation at one allele of the H3F3A gene (encoding histone H3 variant H3.3), replacing the lysine 27 with methionine (K27M). In order to facilitate diagnosis of DIPG patients, a quick and reliable method to identify the H3F3A K27M mutation is needed. Using this optimized real-time PCR assay, we analyzed eleven samples, two of which containing H3F3A K27M mutation, and found that these two samples were differentially amplified from the nine others.  we were able to discern the H3F3A K27M mutation in a newly obtained pediatric brainstem glioblastoma sample whose H3.3 status was not known previously, and in three other DIPG samples as well as paraffin embedded samples. These results demonstrate that we have developed a new reliable procedure for detecting the H3F3A K27M mutation in pediatric glioblastoma patient samples. Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome and was shown to influence EZH2 function A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo? Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1) Genome-wide studies using ChIP-seq on H3.3K27M patient samples indicate a global reduction of H3K27me3 on chromatin. Remarkably, we also found a dramatic enrichment of H3K27me3 and EZH2 (the catalytic subunit H3K27 methyltransferase) at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells Two new studies show that the known histone H3 alteration p.Lys27Met in pediatric glioma leads to globally diminished trimethylation at histone H3 lysine 27.  The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression. Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. These results indicate that H3.3K27M mutation reprograms epigenetic landscape and gene expression, which may drive tumorigenesis. Here, we discuss vaccine treatment for children diagnosed with malignant glioma, through targeting EphA2, IL-13Rα2 and/or histone H3 K27M, while in adults, treatments with RINTEGA, Prophage Series G-100 and dendritic cells are explored. Histone H3 lysine(27)-to-methionine (H3K27M) gain-of-function mutations occur in highly aggressive pediatric gliomas. Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1 (HIST3H1B). Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations Recent sequencing studies have shown that ~30 % of pediatric GBM and ~80 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas show K27M mutations in the H3F3A gene, a variant encoding histone H3.3 Histone H3 lysine(27)-to-methionine (H3K27M) gain-of-function mutations occur in highly aggressive pediatric gliomas Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1 (HIST3H1B) Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3 Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors Pediatric brainstem gliomas often harbor oncogenic K27M mutation of histone H3.3 K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3.  Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases.  We established a Drosophila animal model for the pathogenic histone H3K27M mutation and show that its overexpression resembles polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) loss-of-function phenotypes, causing derepression of PRC2 target genes and developmental perturbations.  Recent sequencing studies have shown that ~30 % of pediatric GBM and ~80 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas show K27M mutations in the H3F3A gene, a variant encoding histone H3.3. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M--including H3.2K27M--mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. Moreover, approximately 30% of pediatric high grade gliomas (pedHGG) including GBM and DIPG harbor a lysine 27 mutation (K27M) in histone 3.3 (H3.3) which is correlated with poor outcome and was shown to influence EZH2 function.The present study investigated the correlation of expression of EZH2 and other PRC2 genes (EZH1, SUZ12, EED) with overall survival of pediatric GBM patients and the cytotoxic impact of EZH2 inhibition by the novel agent Tazemetostat in pediatric GBM/DIPG cells harboring either a H3.3 mutation or a H3 wildtype.EZH2 gene expression does not c Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Important insights have also been uncovered in the field of pediatric glioma, including the identification of recurrent mutation, fusion, and/or duplication events of the BRAF, FGFR1, MYB, and MYBL1 genes in pediatric low-grade gliomas, mutations affecting histone components (H3F3A p.K27M or p.G34) in pediatric high-grade gliomas, and aggressive subsets developing in midline central nervous system structures. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Taken together, our results suggest that mutations disrupting the histone code at H3K36, including H3.3 G34R/V, IDH1 and/or SETD2 mutations, are central to the genesis of hemispheric HGGs in older children and young adults. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Moreover, the gain of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 at gene promoters alters the expression of genes that are associated with various cancer pathways. Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression.

58b6d6f322d300530900000f	What is the inheritance of hypophosphatemic rickets?	Among 35 candidate genes in this region, the dentin matrix protein 1 gene (DMP1) was sequenced to reveal a nonsense mutation 250C/T on exon 6.  Previous research has shown that mutations in the DMP1 gene are responsible for autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets in humans. A novel nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene in a Japanese family with autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets. Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia resulting from renal phosphate wasting.  Prenatal diagnosis for a novel splice mutation of PHEX gene in a large Han Chinese family affected with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of heritable rickets characterized by X-linked dominant inheritance, renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and defective bone mineralization. Molecular analysis of DMP1 mutants causing autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets. We previously demonstrated that the mutations Met1Val (M1V) and the deletion of nucleotides 1484-1490 (1484-1490del) in Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) cause the novel disorder autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), which is associated with elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). First, we examined a kindred with a severe hypophosphatemic rickets phenotype and recessive inheritance.  Discordance for X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets in identical twin girls. We report monozygotic twin girls with a family history consistent with X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets (XLH).  Microsatellite analysis was performed to confirm monozygosity and bi-parental inheritance of the X chromosome.  Hypophosphatemia due to isolated renal phosphate wasting is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Two new genes linked to two different forms of hereditary hypophosphatemias have recently been described. Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. Somatic and germline mosaicism for a mutation of the PHEX gene can lead to genetic transmission of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets that mimics an autosomal dominant trait. Familial hypophosphatemic rickets is usually transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder (XLH), although autosomal dominant forms have also been observed. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively. Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait.  Somatic and germline mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal dominant inheritance. We report two cases of x-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets involving a man and his daughter.  X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets--a report of 2 cases and review of literature. The study of this family tree strongly suggests an x-linked dominant inheritance. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia: clinical characterization of a novel renal phosphate-wasting disorder. We performed clinical and biochemical evaluations of individuals from a large kindred with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia.  In conclusion, autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is an inherited disorder of isolated renal phosphate wasting.  [Scriver type autosomal hypophosphatemic rachitis: a family case]. A familial observation of hypophosphatemic rickets with unusual inheritance and evolution, different from that of X linked hypophosphatemia, is reported.  This observation is quite similar to the 'autosomal hypophosphatemic bone disease' described by Scriver et al.

Autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets was mapped to chromosome 4q21 and identified homozygous mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) gene, which encodes a non-collagenous bone matrix protein. In addition, such CLCN5 mutations that would result in a functional loss have also been demonstrated in Japanese children with idiopathic low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and an Italian kindred with X-linked recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (XLRH) and hypercalciuria. Inactivating mutations of phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome, dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1, and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 are associated with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 1, and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 2, respectively. The objective of the study was to describe the molecular genetic findings in a family affected by hypophosphatemic rickets with presumed autosomal dominant inheritance. The HHRH is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance and is an extremely rare form of hypophosphatemic rickets.

58eb2887eda5a57672000003	Which NGS alignment software implement the Burrows-Wheeler Transform?	For the human genome, Burrows-Wheeler indexing allows Bowtie to align more than 25 million reads per CPU hour with a memory footprint of approximately 1.3 gigabytes. Bowtie extends previous Burrows-Wheeler techniques with a novel quality-aware backtracking algorithm that permits mismatches. We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. SOAP2 is a significantly improved version of the short oligonucleotide alignment program that both reduces computer memory usage and increases alignment speed at an unprecedented rate. We used a Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT) compression index to substitute the seed strategy for indexing the reference sequence in the main memory. We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. Here, we propose a new base-calling algorithm, TotalReCaller, to achieve improved performance. A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. To tackle this problem, a new alignment tool BWBBLE is introduced in this article. We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome. Seed-based algorithms are generally slow but robust, while Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based algorithms are fast but less robust. To have both advantages, we developed an algorithm FANSe2 with iterative mapping strategy based on the statistics of real-world sequencing error distribution to substantially accelerate the mapping without compromising the accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment. In this paper, we propose a BWA-MT tool, evolved from BWA but supporting multi-thread computation, designed to fully utilize the underlying multi-core architecture of computing resources. By using multi-thread computation, BWA-MT can significantly shorten the time needed to generate an alignment for single-end read sequences. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps Although the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tool is one of the most widely used open-source software tools to align read sequences, it is still limited in that it does not fully support multi-thread mechanisms during the alignment steps We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.

58dbb3f18acda34529000019	Which are the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors that are FDA approved?	Inhibition of the PCSK9 protein by monoclonal antibodies results in a dramatic 40%-60% lowering of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).  Alirocumab and evolocumab have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) who do not achieve their LDL-C target on maximal tolerated statin treatment and dietary modification. In addition, evolocumab has been approved by the FDA for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. LDL cholesterol (LDLC) lowering has been revolutionized by PCSK9 inhibitors, Alirocumab (Praluent) and Evolocumab (Repatha), approved as adjuncts to maximally tolerated cholesterol lowering therapy in heterozygous (HeFH) or homozygous (HoFH) familial hypercholesterolemia, and/or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) where LDLC lowering is insufficient. A new class of lipid-lowering drugs, inhibitors of PCSK9 has been generating impressive clinical trial data over the last several years, and alirocumab (Praluent) has become the first to be approved by the US FDA. The second FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab (Repatha) appears to be similar in efficacy and safety to alirocumab (Praluent), but no comparative studies are available.  Two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, have recently been approved by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Newer agents for LDL cholesterol reduction include the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide, the apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotide mipomersen and several molecules that inhibit or interfere with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9).Among the various PCSK9 inhibitors, human data are available for monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 of which the two most advanced are alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) and AMG 145 The 2 or 4‑week subcutaneous therapy with the recently approved antibodies alirocumab and evolocumab for inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in addition to statins and ezetimibe by 50-60 %. In 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, alirocumab (Praluent®; Sanofi/ Regeneron) and evolocumab (Repatha®; Amgen), for use in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients intolerant of statins or those with a major risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but unable to lower their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to optimal levels with statins and ezetimibe. Very recent clinical trials have proven overwhelmingly the effectiveness and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for lowering LDL-C. Both alirocumab and evolocumab have now been approved by the US FDA and there are some initial favorable outcomes data. Food and Drug Administration approved the first two proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, alirocumab (Praluent®; Sanofi/ Regeneron) and evolocumab (Repatha®; Amgen), for use in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and for patients intolerant of statins or those with a major risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but unable to lower their LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to optimal levels with statins and ezetimibe.

5895e4637d9090f353000012	List clinical features of the IMAGe syndrome.	Recently, our group described gain-of-function mutations in the PCNA-binding site of CDKN1C that result in an undergrowth syndrome called IMAGe Syndrome (Intrauterine Growth Restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia, and Genital anomalies), with life-threatening consequences.  IMAGe syndrome is an exceedingly rare condition first described in 1999. Components of the syndrome are intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia and genital anomalies.  OBJECTIVE: Arboleda et al. have recently shown that IMAGe (intra-uterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital abnormalities) syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of maternally expressed gene CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5.  Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies).

58e7a1393e8b6dc87c00000b	Which gene mutations are predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients?	Genetic Variations in Pattern Recognition Receptor Loci Are Associated with Anti-TNF Response in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095) homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024).  Variation at FCGR2A and functionally related genes is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis We aimed to validate this genetic association in a patient cohort from the Spanish population, and also to identify new genes functionally related to FCGR2A that are also associated with anti-TNF response. A total of 348 RA patients treated with an anti-TNF therapy were included and genotyped for FCGR2A polymorphism rs1081274.  Using gene expression profiles from macrophages obtained from synovial fluid of RA patients, we searched for genes highly correlated with FCGR2A expression. We found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to adalimumab (P=0.022). Analyzing the subset of anti-CCP positive RA patients (78%), we also found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to infliximab (P=0.035). DHX32 and RGS12 were the most consistently correlated genes with FCGR2A expression in RA synovial fluid macrophages (P<0.001). We found a significant association between the genetic variation at DHX32 (rs12356233, corrected P=0.019) and a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to adalimumab (rs4690093, uncorrected P=0.040). In the anti-CCP positive group of patients, we also found a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to infliximab (rs2857859, uncorrected P=0.042).

58adca6d9ef3c34033000007	Which proteins control the degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in yeast?	Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 These cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene.  These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises ∼ 1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-coding RNAs, including cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), are subject to degradation by the exosome. The Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation (TRAMP) complex in S. cerevisiae is a nuclear exosome cofactor that recruits the exosome to degrade RNAs  The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has only a minor role in this process The eukaryotic exosome exoribonuclease Rrp6 forms a complex with Rrp47 that functions in nuclear RNA quality control mechanisms, the degradation of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and in the 3 end maturation of stable RNAs Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation Genome-wide studies have identified abundant small, noncoding RNAs, including small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and upstream regulatory RNAs (uRNAs), that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) and terminated by an Nrd1-dependent pathway Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Termination of cryptic unstable transcripts is directed by yeast RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.

58eb6061eda5a57672000005	In which fields of DNA sequencing are Bloom filters applied?	A novel algorithm, fast and accurate classification of sequences (FACSs), is introduced that can accurately and rapidly classify sequences as belonging or not belonging to a reference sequence.  Classification of DNA sequences using Bloom filters Lighter is a fast, memory-efficient tool for correcting sequencing errors. Lighter avoids counting k-mers. Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. Fast lossless compression via cascading Bloom filters In contrast to reference-based methods that first align reads to the genome, we hash all reads into Bloom filters to encode, and decode by querying the same Bloom filters using read-length subsequences of the reference genome. Further compression is achieved by using a cascade of such filters Using cascading Bloom filters to improve the memory usage for de Brujin graphs In this work, we show how to reduce the memory required by the data structure of Chikhi and Rizk (WABI'12) that represents de Brujin graphs using Bloom filters. We introduce a novel hash-based method for constructing the string graph. We use incremental hashing, and specifically a modification of the Karp-Rabin fingerprint, and Bloom filters Further, we note that Bloom filters would be suitable to implicitly store spaced seeds and be tolerant to sequencing errors.  It uses a pair of cache oblivious Bloom filters, one holding a uniform sample of [Formula: see text]-spaced sequenced [Formula: see text]-mers and the other holding [Formula: see text]-mers classified as likely correct, using a simple statistical test. Improving Bloom Filter Performance on Sequence Data Using k-mer Bloom Filters BFs reduce the memory footprint required to store millions of k-mers while allowing for fast set containment queries, at the cost of a low false positive rate (FPR). We consider several variants of such k-mer Bloom filters (kBFs), derive theoretical upper bounds for their FPR, and discuss their range of applications and limitations.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements. The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. These include combinations (at low dose) of existing drugs, e.g., bupropion + naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine + topiramate (Qsymia), higher doses of existing drugs licensed for other indications (liraglutide, 3 mg), and new entities (lorcaserin). RECENT FINDINGS: Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity. Adding to the current available pharmacotherapies for obesity, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 new combination medications known as lorcaserin (Belviq) and phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia).

5a6d0b2db750ff445500002d	Which factors drive replisome disassembly during DNA replication termination and mitosis?	Using Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos and Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we show that the E3 ligase CUL-2LRR-1associates with the replisome and drives ubiquitylation and disassembly of CMG, together with the CDC-48 cofactors UFD-1 and NPL-4. Removal of CMG from chromatin in frog egg extracts requires CUL2 neddylation, and our data identify chromatin recruitment of CUL2LRR1as a key regulated step during DNA replication termination. Interestingly, however, CMG persists on chromatin until prophase in worms that lack CUL-2LRR-1, but is then removed by a mitotic pathway that requires the CDC-48 cofactor UBXN-3, orthologous to the human tumour suppressor FAF1.

SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/SGLT2 dual inhibitor) also have a mild or moderate intestinal and renal SGLT1 inhibitory effect because of their relatively weak selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Hydrogen-bonded structures and interaction energies in two forms of the SGLT-2 inhibitor sotagliflozin. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin, an oral inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2, in combination with insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Phase 2 studies with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagliflozin, which acts in the gut and the kidney, have demonstrated reductions in A1C, weight, and glucose variability without an increased incidence of hypoglycemia. Sotagliflozin may meet this need, because this compound lowers blood glucose through the insulin-independent mechanisms of inhibiting kidney SGLT2 and intestinal SGLT1.  AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors focus specifically on sotagliflozin (LX4211), the first-in-class dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. Despite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies.  Therefore, sotagliflozin (LX4211) has been developed as a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2.  Sotagliflozin, a Dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibitor, as Adjunct Therapy to Insulin in Type 1 Diabetes.

58f8a08370f9fc6f0f00001b	Which are the main manifestations of Ohdo syndrome?	 This finding together with the phenotypic analogies shared with the carriers of c.5898dupC mutation suggests the existence of a fourth MED12-related disorder, characterized by severe ID, absent or deficient language and, milder, clinical manifestation in heterozygotes. Skeletal manifestations in Ohdo syndrome: a case with bilateral patella dislocations. We report a new case of Ohdo syndrome with bilateral patella dislocations where surgical intervention has been indicated. A review of the skeletal manifestations reported in the literature on Ohdo syndrome reveals that joint laxity and skeletal deformities are important aspects of the phenotype. We confirm the existence of this condition that, although similar to Ohdo syndrome, seems to be an independent clinical entity.

5a43b2d7966455904c00000c	Which are the best methods for the prediction of circular RNA (circRNA)?	Numerous algorithms that are used to detect genome-wide circRNA expression from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data have been developed in the past few years, but there is little overlap in their predictions and no clear gold-standard method to assess the accuracy of these algorithms. We developed the software tandem, DCC and CircTest DCC uses output from the STAR read mapper to systematically detect back-splice junctions in next-generation sequencing data. Circular RNA profile in gliomas revealed by identification tool UROBORUS. In this work, we have developed a computational pipeline named UROBORUS to detect circRNAs in total RNA-seq data.   Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. miARma-Seq: a comprehensive tool for miRNA, mRNA and circRNA analysis.

5a68ff52b750ff445500001c	Which tendons are affected in the Dequervain's tenosynovitis?	DeQuervain's tenosynovitis is a common cause of radial-sided wrist pain. Symptoms result from a narrow first dorsal compartment and associated tendinosis of the enclosed extensor pollicis brevis and/or abductor pollicis longus (APL).  DeQuervain's disease of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist, is a common wrist pathology, pain results from resisted gliding of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis tendon in the fibroosseous canal.  DeQuervain tenosynovitis, which involves the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, is much more common in women than men and is due to repetitive movements of the hand such as grasping and twisting.

590c740d70f9fc6f0f00001d	Which proteins are controlling sterol metabolism in S. cerevisiae?	We have taken advantage of this property to study the regulation of the Delta8-Delta7-sterol isomerase-encoding ERG2 gene in an ergosterol auxotrophic mutant devoid of squalene-synthase activity.  Ergosterol starvation leads to an 8-16-fold increase in ERG2 gene expression. The yeast genome encodes seven oxysterol binding protein homologs, Osh1p-Osh7p, which have been implicated in regulating intracellular lipid and vesicular transport Sterol metabolism and ERG2 gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomewide location analysis of Candida albicans Upc2p, a regulator of sterol metabolism and azole drug resistance. To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important regulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans  Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to ergosterol biosynthesis genes. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1).  Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others) Cell wall maintenance genes TIR4 and CCW12, sterol metabolism gene UPC2, small molecule transport genes AUS1 and YHK8, and stress response gene CUP1-1 were expressed at a level at least 2.5-fold higher than the expression level found in 9763S.

5925227670f9fc6f0f000020	Which enzymes are responsible for base J creation in Trypanosoma brucei?	Synthesis of the modified thymine base, beta-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil or J, within telomeric DNA of Trypanosoma brucei correlates with the bloodstream form specific epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes involved in antigenic variation.  We have recently proposed a model in which chromatin remodeling by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein (JBP2) regulates the developmental and de novo site-specific localization of J synthesis within bloodstream form trypanosome DNA. JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes. The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis.   We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis. Two thymidine hydroxylases differentially regulate the formation of glucosylated DNA at regions flanking polymerase II polycistronic transcription units throughout the genome of Trypanosoma brucei. We have previously characterized two thymidine-hydroxylases (TH), JBP1 and JBP2, which regulate J-biosynthesis. JBP2 is a chromatin re-modeling protein that induces de novo J-synthesis, allowing JBP1, a J-DNA binding protein, to stimulate additional J-synthesis. JBP2 and JBP1 are capable of stimulating de novo J-synthesis. Chromosome-internal J deposition is primarily mediated by JBP1, whereas JBP2-stimulated J deposition at the telomeric regions.  β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes. Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein. The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive.   The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J. β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU).

The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma: final overall survival results of a multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006). BACKGROUND: Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules.  OBJECTIVE: Report results of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms from phase III KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. Patient-reported outcomes in KEYNOTE-006, a randomised study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma Pembrolizumab (Keytruda(®)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), a key immunoinhibitory checkpoint protein implicated in down-regulating anti-tumour immune responses. This intravenous drug is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, on the basis of its clinical benefit in this setting in the phase I KEYNOTE 001 trial (expansion cohorts) and the phase II and III trials, KEYNOTE 002 and 006. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. (Funded by Merck Sharp&Dohme; KEYNOTE-006 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01866319.).

5a70dbe599e2c3af26000004	Which two genes are implicated in Juvenile polyposis syndrome?	 JPS is most frequently caused by mutations in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Herein, we report a child with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) with a novel mutation in the SMAD4 gene.  Subsequent genetic screening revealed a novel mutation in SMAD4, exon 5 (p.Ser144Stop).  A SMAD4 mutation indicative of juvenile polyposis syndrome in a family previously diagnosed with Menetrier's disease. CONCLUSION: The 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 is the cause of JPS and the likely cause of MD in a large family initially diagnosed with MD. A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD.  ince his initial diagnosis of JPS further studies have confirmed an association between JPS and mutations in BMPR1A in chromosome band 10q23.2, which is in close proximity to PTEN. Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4. Exome sequencing identified a germline heterozygous mutation in SMAD9 (SMAD9(V90M)).  Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Somatic alterations in juvenile polyps from BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients. The JPS is caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A.  Germline mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A disrupt the transforming growth factor β signal transduction pathway, and are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. Individuals with JPS due to mutations in SMAD4 are at greater risk to manifest signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). BMPR1A and SMAD4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. In about 50%-60% of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene is found. Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either SMAD4 or BMPR1A. BACKGROUND In patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) the frequency of large genomic deletions in the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes was unknown. in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome jps the frequency of large genomic deletions in the smad4 and bmpr1a genes was unknown mutation and phenotype analysis was used in 80 unrelated patients of whom 65 met the clinical criteria for jps typical jps and 15 were suspected to have jps by direct sequencing of the two genes point mutations were identified in 30 patients 46 of typical jps using mlpa large genomic deletions were found in 14 of all patients with typical jps six deletions in smad4 and three deletions in bmpr1a mutation analysis of the pten gene in the remaining 41 mutation negative cases uncovered a point mutation in two patients 5 smad4 mutation carriers had a significantly higher frequency of gastric polyposis 73 than did patients with bmpr1a mutations 8 p 0 001 all seven cases of gastric cancer occurred in families with smad4 mutations smad4 mutation carriers with gastric polyps were significantly older at gastroscopy than those without p 0 001 in 22 of the 23 unrelated smad4 mutation carriers hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia hht was also diagnosed clinically the documented histologic findings encompassed a wide distribution of different polyp types comparable with that described in hereditary mixed polyposis syndromes hmps screening for large deletions raised the mutation detection rate to 60 in the 65 patients with typical jps a strong genotype phenotype correlation for gastric polyposis gastric cancer and hht was identified which should have implications for counselling and surveillance histopathological results in hamartomatous polyposis syndromes must be critically interpreted. juvenile polyposis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple distinct juvenile polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal cancer the cumulative life time risk of colorectal cancer is 39 and the relative risk is 34 juvenile polyps have a distinctive histology characterized by an abundance of edematous lamina propria with inflammatory cells and cystically dilated glands lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelium with reactive changes clinically juvenile polyposis syndrome is defined by the presence of 5 or more juvenile polyps in the colorectum juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract or any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history of juvenile polyposis in about 50 60 of patients diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome a germline mutation in the smad4 or bmpr1a gene is found both genes play a role in the bmp tgf beta signalling pathway it has been suggested that cancer in juvenile polyposis may develop through the so called landscaper mechanism where an abnormal stromal environment leads to neoplastic transformation of the adjacent epithelium and in the end invasive carcinoma recognition of this rare disorder is important for patients and their families with regard to treatment follow up and screening of at risk individuals each clinician confronted with the diagnosis of a juvenile polyp should therefore consider the possibility of juvenile polyposis syndrome in addition juvenile polyposis syndrome provides a unique model to study colorectal cancer pathogenesis in general and gives insight in the molecular genetic basis of cancer this review discusses clinical manifestations genetics pathogenesis and management of juvenile polyposis syndrome. juvenile polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by multiple juvenile polyps arising in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers specifically colon cancer bmpr1a and smad4 germline mutations have been found in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome we identified a bmpr1a mutation which involves a duplication of coding exon 3 c 230 452 333 441dup1995 on multiple ligation dependent probe amplification in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome the mutation causes a frameshift producing a truncated protein p d112nfsx2 therefore the mutation is believed to be pathogenic we also identified a duplication breakpoint in which alu sequences are located these results suggest that the duplication event resulted from recombination between alu sequences to our knowledge partial duplication in the bmpr1a gene has not been reported previously this is the first case report to document coding exon 3 duplication in the bmpr1a gene in a patient with juvenile polyposis syndrome. juvenile polyposis syndrome is a dominant gi polyposis syndrome defined by 5 gi juvenile polyps or 1 juvenile polyps with a family history of juvenile

Only one sporadic patient was a compound heterozygote for two recessive mutations. Patients offspring of consanguineous parents showed homozygous changes in a variety of genes includingCRTAP,FKBP10,LEPRE1,PLOD2,PPIB,SERPINF1,TMEM38B, andWNT1. here is minimal literature on the mechanism of action for variants in SERPINH1 resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta  The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. hese results expand the range of CRTAP/LEPRE1 mutations that result in recessive OI  Autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) accounts for 10% of all OI cases, and, currently, mutations in 10 genes (CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, SERPINH1, FKBP10, SERPINF1, SP7, BMP1, TMEM38B, and WNT1) are known to be responsible for this form of the disease. We have recently shown that FKBP10 previously reported as a novel autosomal recessive OI gene also defines a novel Bruck syndrome locus (BKS3). Autosomal recessive mutations in a number of genes have also been described, including the BMP1 gene that encodes the mammalian Tolloid (mTLD) and its shorter isoform bone morphogenic protein-1 (BMP1). n this article, we performed clinical assessment and sought mutations in patients from 10 unrelated families with AR-OI, one of whom was presented with the additional features of Bruck syndrome (BS). Pathogenic changes were identified in five different genes: three families had mutations in FKBP10, three in SERPINF1, two in LEPRE1, one in CRTAP, and one in PPIB.  Two of the genes encoding proteins involved in that enzyme complex, LEPRE1 and cartilage-associated protein, when mutated have been shown to cause autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta The discovery of mutations involving CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes in severe/lethal and recessively inherited osteogenesis imperfecta has provided partial answers to questions about 'other' osteogenesis imperfecta genes in patients with an osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype but no COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations	[['Sp7/Osx'], ['FK506-binding protein'], ['Hsp47/SERPINH1'], ['CRTAP'], ['P3H1'], ['PPIB'], ['WNT1'], ['LEPRE1'], ['PLOD2'], ['TMEM38B'], ['BMP1'], ['SEC24D'], ['cartilage associated protein']]
5a736efc3b9d13c708000006	Which chromosomes are implicated in the Emanuel syndrome?	Single‑nucleotide polymorphism‑array analysis of the proband indicated a partial duplication of chromosomes 22 and 11 at 22q11.1‑q11.21 and 11q23.3‑q25, respectively, which confirmed the diagnosis of ES. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11).  Emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome, which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22.  Multiple congenital anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphism are characterizing the so-called Emanuel or supernumerary der(22)t(11;22) syndrome (OMIM609029).  Complex sSMCs consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome, for example, the derivative der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) in Emanuel syndrome. A case with Emanuel syndrome: extra derivative 22 chromosome inherited from the mother.  Affected children are usually identified in the newborn period as the offspring of balanced (11;22) translocation carriers. We report a 3-year-old boy with the t(11;22)(q23;q11) chromosome, transmitted in an unbalanced fashion from his mother.  Balanced carriers of t(11;22) usually manifest no clinical symptoms, and are often identified after the birth of offspring with an unbalanced form of this translocation, known as Emanuel syndrome.  Derivative 11;22 (emanuel) syndrome: a case report and a review. Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome.  The syndrome is caused by chromosomal imbalance due to a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22.  We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X [Turner syndrome (TS)], trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests.  Emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3:1 meiotic segregation from parental balanced translocation carrier t(11;22)(q23;q11), mostly of maternal origin.  Here in, we describe a female patient with supernumerary der(22) syndrome (Emanuel syndrome) due to balanced translocation carrier father t(11;22) (q23;q11).  The t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) is the main recurrent germline translocation in humans. Unbalanced translocation can be transmitted to the progeny and can cause Emanuel syndrome. Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) constitute one of the smallest subsets within the patients with an sSMC.

regarding the characteristics of prenatal biochemical screening or ultrasonographic markers in this syndrome we aimed to identify a prenatal screening pattern characteristic of emanuel syndrome we report the prenatal characteristics of five fetuses with emanuel syndrome four of which were diagnosed prenatally we found no consistent pattern of prenatal biochemical markers or other prenatal characteristics nevertheless increased nt low papp a and ultrasound features such as intra uterine growth restriction posterior fossa cardiac and bowel abnormalities may be helpful in raising the suspicion for this rare genetic syndrome review of the biochemical screening results ultrasound findings and demographic characteristics of this emanuel syndrome case series as well as of the relevant literature fail to suggest a characteristic prenatal pattern. emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22 the frequency of this syndrome has been reported as 1 in 110 000 it is a rare anomaly associated with multiple systemic malformations such as micrognathia and congenital heart disease in addition patients with emanuel syndrome may have seizure disorders we experienced anesthetic management of a patient with emanuel syndrome who underwent palatoplasty this patient had received tracheotomy due to micrognathia in addition he had atrial septal defect mild pulmonary artery stenosis and cleft palate palatoplasty was performed without any complication during anesthesia close attention was directed to cardiac function seizure and airway management. complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes ssmc constitute one of the smallest subgroups of ssmc in general complex ssmc consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 der 22 t 11 22 or emanuel syndrome in 2008 we speculated that complex ssmc could be part of an underestimated entity here the overall yet reported 412 complex ssmc are summarized they constitute 8 4 of all yet in detail characterized ssmc cases the majority of the complex ssmc is contributed by patients suffering from emanuel syndrome 82 besides there are a der 22 t 8 22 q24 1 q11 1 and a der 13 t 13 18 q11 p11 21 or der 21 t 18 21 p11 21 q11 1 der 13 or 21 t 13 or 21 18 syndrome the latter two represent another 2 6 and 2 2 of the complex ssmc cases respectively the large majority of complex ssmc has a centric minute shape and derives from an acrocentric chromosome nonetheless complex ssmc can involve material from each chromosomal origin most complex ssmc are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non mosaic interestingly there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved complex ssmc need to be considered in diagnostics especially in non mosaic centric minute shaped ssmc as yet three complex ssmc associated syndromes are identified as recurrent breakpoints in the complex ssmc were characterized it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of ssmc overall complex ssmc emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation. emanuel syndrome is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and developmental disability it is caused by the presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome that contains material from chromosomes 11 and 22 the origin of this imbalance is 3 1 malsegregation of a parental balanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 which is the most common recurrent reciprocal translocation in humans little has been published on the clinical features of this syndrome since the 1980s and information on natural history is limited we designed a questionnaire to collect information from families recruited through an international online support group chromosome 22 central data gathered include information on congenital anomalies medical and surgical history developmental and behavioral issues and current abilities we received information on 63 individuals with emanuel syndrome ranging in age from newborn to adulthood as previously recognized congenital anomalies were common the most frequent being ear pits 76 micrognathia 60 heart malformations 57 and cleft palate 54 our data suggest that vision and hearing impairment seizures failure to thrive and recurrent infections particularly otitis media are common in this syndrome psychomotor development is uniformly delayed however the majority of individuals over 70 eventually learn to walk with support language development and ability for self care are also very impaired this study provides new information on the clinical spectrum and natural history of emanuel syndrome for families and physicians caring for these individuals. emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3 1 meiotic segregation from parental balanced translocation carrier t 11 22 q23 q11 mostly of maternal origin it is characterized by mental retardation microcephaly preauricular tag or sinus ear anomalies cleft or high arched palate micrognathia congenital heart diseases kidney abnormalities structural brain anomalies and genital anomalies in male here in we describe a female patient with supernumerary der 22 syndrome emanuel syndrome due to balanced translocation carrier father t 11 22 q23 q11 she was mentally and physically disabled and had most of the craniofacial dysmorphism of this syndrome our patient had cleft palate maldeveloped corpus callosum and hind brain with normal internal organs additionally arachnodactyly hyperextensibility of hand joints abnormal deep palmar and finger creases extra finger creases and bilateral talipus were evident and not previously described with this syndrome cytogenetic analysis and fish documented that the patient had both translocation chromosomes plus an additional copy of der 22 with karyotyping 47 xx t 11 22 q23 q11 der 22 t 11 22 q23 q11 we postulated that this rare chromosomal complement can arise from 2 2 segregation in the first meiotic division of the balanced translocation father followed by non disjunction at meiosis ii in the balanced spermatocyte. emanuel syndrome results from der 22 t 11q23 22q11 cleft palate ear anomalies heart defects genital anomalies hypotonia and mental retardation are the main features of the syndrome we report a nine year old boy with the t 11 22 q23 q11

cryptorchidism he has novel findings such as joint hyperextensibility left liver lobe agenesis left sided malposition of the gallbladder and pancreas hypoplasia this is the first report associating

Endogenous ROF1 was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media (0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl) at both an mRNA and protein level.  Arabidopsis ROF1 (AtFKBP62) is a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase and a member of the FKBP (FK506 binding protein) family. ROF1 expression is induced by heat stress and developmentally regulated. Exposure of plants to low levels of MDA using a recently developed protocol powerfully upregulated many genes on a cDNA microarray with a bias towards those implicated in abiotic/environmental stress (e.g. ROF1 and XERO2). Arabidopsis immunophilins ROF1 (AtFKBP62) and ROF2 (AtFKBP65) exhibit tissue specificity, are heat-stress induced, and bind HSP90. The abundance of ROF1 mRNA increased several-fold under stress conditions such as wounding or exposure to elevated NaCl levels.	[['Wounding'], ['Elevated NaCl levels'], ['Heat']]

We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks.  In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo.

5a67a207b750ff4455000008	List indications for palivizumab for treatment of RSV-induced bronchiolitis. 	 Palivizumab reduces the burden of bronchiolitis but does not prevent infection. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants.  Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection.  Palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended for infants with qualifying high risk conditions. Recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics to guide diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bronchiolitis. Palivizumab is effective in reducing RSV hospitalization in high risk patient groups.  .CONCLUSION: Palivizumab was effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalization infection in CF patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants 29 to 32 weeks' gestation without chronic illness, palivizumab use was associated with reduced RSV hospitalizations but increased hospitalizations for bronchiolitis without RSV diagnosis. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease. Eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis in a cohort of children with severe bronchiolitis. n 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated their recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis for children who are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. To investigate the potential impact of the more restrictive 2014 criteria on the eligibility for palivizumab prophylaxis, we applied the 2012 and 2014 AAP recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis to a multicenter cohort of 2207 US children hospitalized for bronchiolitis. The decrease was largely driven by the restriction of eligibility to preterm infants with gestational age<29 weeks. To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting. Preventing RSV bronchiolitis in vulnerable infants: the role of palivizumab. Palivizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV is the only agent licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk children. OBJECTIVES Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is the only existent immunoprophylaxis therapy for prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants (up to 2 years of age), particularly in those who meet high-risk criteria (preterm infants and/or those with bronchopulmonary or congenital heart disease). CONCLUSION Palivizumab provides cost-effective prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants. OBJECTIVE To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used as prevention against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection requiring hospitalisation, in the indication of preterm infants and infants with preterm/bronchopulmonary dysplasia and in the second indication of children with congenital heart disease in the Dutch healthcare setting.

5a7244aa2dc08e987e00000f	Which two interleukins are inhibited by Ustekinumab?	The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-12/23 p40 antibody, and guselkumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-23 antibody, were evaluated in adults with active RA despite methotrexate (MTX) therapy. The purpose of this review is to update the reader on treatment options for PsA using conventional synthetic disease modifying agents (csDMARDs) and novel therapies including tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, interleukin 12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab), the interleukin 17 antagonists including secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, and the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, apremilast.  Expert opinion: Based on the rationale of the involvement of the IL-23/Th17 axis in AS, novel biological agents have been developed and include secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A agent and ustekinumab, an anti-IL-23 antibody. Besides systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA), options also include intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and biologics such as the TNFα inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept; the interleukin (IL) 12/23 antibody ustekinumab; the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra; and the IL-1β antibody canakinumab. Objective: To determine whether blockade of the interleukin 23-helper T cell 17 (IL-23-TH17) pathway with ustekinumab represents an efficacious and, based on its proinflammatory cytokine profile, targeted treatment option in PRP. The use of monoclonal antibodies against interleukin (IL)-12 and -23, such as ustekinumab, has considerably reduced the disease burden in many patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, is approved in the USA and Europe for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA.  This study is a retrospective analysis of routine parameter dynamics and laboratory adverse events (LAE) in psoriasis patients on long-term treatment (n = 199) with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α-antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept), and the interleukin (IL)12/23-antagonist ustekinumab.  Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit, which is part of interleukins IL-12 and IL-23. The biologic, Ustekinumab (Stelara®, Centocor, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA), is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23 (IL-12 and IL-23). Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. A recent example is ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Centocor Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 protein subunit of human interleukins 12 and 23 with high affinity and specificity, thereby preventing interaction with their surface IL-12Rβ1 receptor.

Ustekinumab (Stelara) is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeted against the p40 shared subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. In the past years, the IL-23/Th17 axis has emerged as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PsA. Ustekinumab, a fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that targets the common subunit p40 of IL-12 and IL-23, has been shown in clinical trials, to be well-tolerated and effective in patients with active PsA. We compared two biologic agents, ustekinumab (an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 blocker) and etanercept (an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha), for the treatment of psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with psoriasis. Anti-p40 antibodies ustekinumab and briakinumab: blockade of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 in the treatment of psoriasis. A randomized trial of Ustekinumab, a human interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12/23. ABT-874 (Abbott Laboratories, Saint-Laurent, QC,) and ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Ortho Biotech, Toronto, ON) are two monoclonal antibodies against interleukins 12 and 23 (IL-12/23), key mediators of T-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Ustekinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody that targets the common p40 subunit that is shared by both interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, consequently inhibiting T-cell differentiation along both Th1 and Th17 pathways. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit shared by interleukin 12 and interleukin 23, two naturally occurring protein regulators that play an important role in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA). BACKGROUND Ustekinumab, a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1K monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12/23, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275, Centocor Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the shared p40 protein subunit of human interleukins 12 and 23 with high affinity and specificity, thereby preventing interaction with their surface IL-12Rβ1 receptor. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody belonging to a newly developed class of biological, anti-cytokine medications that notably targets the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and -23, both naturally occurring proteins that are important in regulating the immune system and are understood to play a role in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor β1 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. INTRODUCTION Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. BACKGROUND Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL) 12 and IL-23 and inhibits their pharmacological activity. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity and affinity to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, thereby suppressing IL-12- and IL-23-mediated inflammation associated with psoriasis. Two human anti-p40 monoclonal antibodies targeting both IL-12 and IL-23 via their shared p40 subunit have been developed: briakinumab and ustekinumab. evaluate ustekinumab an anti interleukin il 12

characteristics comorbidities significantly contributed to the between subject variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters the developed exposure response model can serve as a basis to support future alternative dosing regimens for ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis a robust exposure response relationship has been confirmed for ustekinumab in psoriasis. interleukin 23 is thought to be critical to the pathogenesis of psoriasis we compared risankizumab bi 655066 a humanized igg1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin 23 by specifically targeting the p19 subunit and thus prevents interleukin 23 signaling and ustekinumab an interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 inhibitor in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis we randomly assigned a total of 166 patients to receive subcutaneous injections of risankizumab a single 18 mg dose at week 0 or 90 mg or 180 mg doses at weeks 0 4 and 16 or ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg according to body weight at weeks 0 4 and 16 the primary end point was a 90 or greater reduction from baseline in the psoriasis area and severity index pasi score at week 12 at week 12 the percentage of patients with a 90 or

with a 100 reduction in the pasi score was 45 in the pooled 90 mg and 180 mg risankizumab groups as compared with 18 in the ustekinumab group efficacy was generally maintained up to 20 weeks after the final dose of 90 or 180 mg of risankizumab in the 18 mg and 90 mg risankizumab groups and the ustekinumab group 5 patients 12 6 patients 15 and 3 patients 8 respectively had serious adverse events including two basal cell carcinomas and one major cardiovascular adverse event there were no serious adverse events in the 180 mg risankizumab group in this phase 2 trial selective blockade of interleukin 23 with risankizumab was associated with clinical responses superior to those associated with ustekinumab this trial was not large enough or of long enough duration to draw conclusions about safety funded by boehringer ingelheim clinicaltrials gov number nct02054481. 1 for adults with plaque psoriasis after failure of topical symptomatic treatments and puva therapy several systemic immunosuppressive agents are acceptable for severe disease methotrexate then ciclosporin and possible a tnf alpha antagonist etanercept etc 2 ustekinumab is an inhibitor of interleukins 12 and 23 which are believed to be implicated in the onset of psoriasis it is authorized in the european union for patients who fail to respond to conventional systemic treatments 3 in one trial with a low level of evidence single blind 2 subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab at an interval of 4 weeks appeared to be statistically more effective than twice weekly subcutaneous injections of etanercept for 12 weeks more patients achieved a 75 reduction in the score most widely used to evaluate the extent and intensity of plaque psoriasis lesions pasi score about 71 versus 57 the results beyond this period have not been reported 4 two randomised double blind placebo controlled trials in a total of 1996 patients showed that at least two thirds of patients treated with ustekinumab achieved at least a 75 reduction in their pasi score versus fewer than 4 with placebo 5 in animal studies interleukin 12 and 23 inhibitors cause cancer there is therefore a high risk of cancer developing during prolonged treatment with ustekinumab 6 the main adverse effects identified in clinical trials include infections injection site reactions psychological disorders and development of anti ustekinumab antibodies 7 there is insufficient follow up to evaluate the cardiac risks associated with ustekinumab 8 as maintenance therapy ustekinumab is administered as one subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks this practical advantage compared to tnf alpha antagonists must be weighed against the risks inherent in prolonged immunosuppression 9 in summary for symptomatic relief of patients whose psoriasis poses major problems despite treatment with methotrexate or ciclosporin in the absence of a better alternative it is better to use a tnf alpha antagonist and to avoid exposing patients to the risks associated with ustekinumab particularly its carcinogenic risk. biologic agents offer a range of new therapeutic options for patients with psoriasis however the relative benefit risk profiles of such therapies are not well known we compared two biologic agents ustekinumab an interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 blocker and etanercept an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha for the treatment of psoriasis we randomly assigned 903 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis to receive subcutaneous injections of either 45 or 90 mg of ustekinumab at weeks 0 and 4 or high dose etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks the primary end point was the proportion of patients with at least 75 improvement in the psoriasis area and severity index pasi at week 12 a secondary end point was the proportion with cleared or minimal disease on the basis of the physician s global assessment assessors were unaware of the treatment assignments the efficacy and safety of a crossover from etanercept

We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated "bystander" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs).

5a7636d39e632bc066000004	Which R packages have been developed for the discovery of mutational signatures in cancer?	signeR: an empirical Bayesian approach to mutational signature discovery. Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: signeR is implemented in R and C ++, and is available as a R package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/signeR Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition.Results: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions.Availability: All tools developed in this paper have been implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or "mutation signatures" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with "mixed-membership models" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/. SomaticSignatures: inferring mutational signatures from single-nucleotide variants. Mutational signatures are patterns in the occurrence of somatic single-nucleotide variants that can reflect underlying mutational processes.

5a981e66fcd1d6a10c00002f	According to guidelines, insulin resistance is one risk factor in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, name 3 more risk factors.	 Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally defined as a cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors which are often associated with the condition of insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity Metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease in women. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature mortality. The components are abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia.  Abdominal obesity is frequently associated with a collection of metabolic disorders that include elevated blood pressure, characteristic lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides) and increased fasting glucose, with an underlying situation of insulin resistance, which has been defined as metabolic syndrome The presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components (abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and high fasting blood glucose) allows to diagnose metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome has 5 criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, fasting hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose level, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states that promote atherosclerotic CVD and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The metabolic syndrome is a complex association of several risk factors including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and essential hypertension.   insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity.  The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors which predispose an individual to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is general consensus regarding the main components of the syndrome (glucose intolerance, obesity, raised blood pressure and dyslipidaemia [elevated triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol])  Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors - including abdominal obesity, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and elevated blood pressure The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors including glucose dysregulation, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), also termed syndrome X, is a distinctive constellation of risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The syndrome's hallmarks are glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, a characteristic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), obesity, upper-body fat distribution, hypertension, and increased prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic factors "The metabolic syndrome" is the name for a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that are of metabolic origin. These risk factors consist of atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state.  Metabolic Syndrome X is a clinical entity which comprises the following factors: diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, high levels of triglyceride and/or low levels of HDL cholesterol, central obesity and microalbuminuria metabolic syndrome, produced by genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and certain nutrient excesses.

5a68fd01b750ff445500001b	What is included in the fourth generation HIV test?	Diagnosing acute HIV infection at point of care: a retrospective analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of a fourth-generation point-of-care test for detection of HIV core protein p24. Previous evaluation of the fourth-generation Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo POCT showed only 50% sensitivity for HIV core protein p24 (p24 antigen) detection, which is suboptimal for diagnosis of acute HIV infection with limited advantage over third-generation POCT. CONCLUSIONS: This new POCT shows improved sensitivity for detection of p24 antigen and may be of value for clinical use in detecting acute HIV infection. While fourth generation antigen-antibody combination assays have been successful in high-resource settings, rapid point of care (POC) versions of these assays have yet to demonstrate high sensitivity to detect AHI.  STUDY DESIGN: A total of 30,201 sera were tested for HIV diagnosis using Abbott Architect®HIV-Ag/Ab-Combo 4th-gen-EIA at a hospital in Spain during 17 months.  OBJECTIVE: To determine if fourth-generation antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) would have detected HIV infection earlier than the third-generation RDT used in MTN-003 (VOICE). BACKGROUND: Fourth generation assays detect simultaneously antibodies for HIV and the p24 antigen, identifying HIV infection earlier than previous generation tests. The status of clients on ART was additionally confirmed by fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combo tests, Architect and Genscreen Ultra. INTRODUCTION: We describe the overall accuracy and performance of a serial rapid HIV testing algorithm used in community-based HIV testing in the context of a population-based household survey conducted in two sub-districts of uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, against reference fourth-generation HIV-1/2 antibody and p24 antigen combination immunoassays. The sample was later routinely tested with a fourth generation antigen/antibody assay as per local protocol and was strongly positive. The fourth-generation HIV EIA was positive presumably because it detects p24 HIV antigen as well as antibodies, unlike rapid HIV tests and third-generation HIV EIAs.This case highlights not only the importance of frontline providers to understand the different testing methodologies for HIV screening and their limitations but the importance of clinical suspicion as well. This second diagnostic window was caused by the absence of HIV specific antibodies and the decline of HIV p24 antigen concentrations below the detection limits of the fourth generation assays. Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the test-negative window to 11 to 14 days.	[['antibodies for HIV'], ['p24 antigen']]
5a6f7e6ab750ff4455000052	List four principles of medical ethics.	Respect for Autonomy (RFA) has been a mainstay of medical ethics since its enshrinement as one of the four principles of biomedical ethics by Beauchamp and Childress' in the late 1970s There are four principles of medical ethics; Beneficence, Respect for autonomy, Non-maleficence, and Justice. This paper argues that the four prima facie principles-beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice-afford a good and widely acceptable basis for 'doing good medical ethics'.  Contemporary clinical ethics was founded on principlism, and the four principles: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice, remain dominant in medical ethics discourse and practice. Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm. Guided by the medical ethics principles of "four principles plus scope," Chinese aesthetic medical practitioners have proposed some extremely valuable ethical principles combined with the construction of aesthetic medicine and the requirements of clinical practice such as the principle of general nonmaleficence, the principle of local minimal invasiveness, the principle of informed consent, and the principle of respect and confidentiality. This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles. BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care.  Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted.  Tom Beauchamp and James Childress have always maintained that their four principles approach (otherwise known as principlism) is a globally applicable framework for biomedical ethics. This claim is grounded in their belief that the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice form part of a 'common morality', or collection of very general norms to which everyone who is committed to morality subscribes. I will argue that there are difficulties with the application of the four principles approach to incompetent children. The most important principle - respect for autonomy - is not directly applicable to incompetent children and the most appropriate modification of the principle for them is not clear. The principle of beneficence - that one should act in the child's interests - is complicated by difficulties in assessing what a child's interests are and to which standard of interests those choosing for children should be held. These principles are: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, along with concern for their scope of application. BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. Four main principles underlie medical ethics: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. This approach to treatment is discussed in the context of the four principles of medical ethics, namely respect for autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence.

Nonetheless, infliximab and adalimumab are the only biological agents that have been approved for this group of patients.  In September 2013, the European Medicines Agency approved two infliximab biosimilars for treatment of adult and paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients, The introduction of infliximab into clinical practice is one of the most significant advances in the care of patients who have IBD. Infliximab has become an important part of the medical armamentarium to treat extraintestinal manifestations that often are refractory to other medications and are a significant cause of morbidity in these patients. Two other TNF inhibitors recently have demonstrated efficacy in CD: certolizumab pegol and adalimumab. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is effective for induction and maintenance of remission of CD and UC. The role of infliximab for EIMs related to IBD has been less studied, but it is likely as effective. The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) has prepared clinical practice guidelines to help physicians prescribe corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for these patients.  lthough the TNF inhibitor infliximab is known to improve IBD outcomes in many different ways, several questions remain regarding the optimal way to employ this drug in the clinic,  Infliximab biosimilars for the treatment of IBD have been available in Europe and Asia for a few years and are expected to become available in the United States within the next 1 to 2 years	[['infliximab (IFX)'], ['adalimumab (ADA)']]

5a760e5583b0d9ea66000018	Which comparisons demonstrate the applicability of StereoGene in regulatory genomics?	StereoGene: rapid estimation of genome-wide correlation of continuous or interval feature data. Genomics features with similar genome-wide distributions are generally hypothesized to be functionally related, for example, colocalization of histones and transcription start sites indicate chromatin regulation of transcription factor activity. Therefore, statistical algorithms to perform spatial, genome-wide correlation among genomic features are required.Results: Here, we propose a method, StereoGene, that rapidly estimates genome-wide correlation among pairs of genomic features. These features may represent high-throughput data mapped to reference genome or sets of genomic annotations in that reference genome. StereoGene enables correlation of continuous data directly, avoiding the data binarization and subsequent data loss. Correlations are computed among neighboring genomic positions using kernel correlation. Representing the correlation as a function of the genome position, StereoGene outputs the local correlation track as part of the analysis. StereoGene also accounts for confounders such as input DNA by partial correlation. We apply our method to numerous comparisons of ChIP-Seq datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE to demonstrate its wide applicability. We observe the changes in the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types consistent with known biology and find a novel spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with donor splice sites and with poly(A) sites. These analyses provide examples for the broad applicability of StereoGene for regulatory genomics.

The patient was diagnosed with Zieve's syndrome and managed with supportive measures. After exclusion of other possibilities, Zieve's syndrome was diagnosed. This is a condition of hyperbilirubinaemia, Coombs' negative haemolytic anaemia and hyperlipidaemia associated with alcoholism. We report a case of recurrent Zieve's syndrome, consisting of jaundice, hemolytic anemia and hyperlipoproteinemia, initiated by alcohol abuse. The crucial feature of this syndrome, which allows differentiation with common acute alcoholic hepatitis, is the presence of hemolysis Zieve's syndrome consists of transient haemolytic anaemic, jaundice, hyperlipidaemia and alcohol-induced liver disease. Zieve's syndrome (hyperlipidaemia, anaemia and fatty liver degeneration) may rarely occur with intracranial haemorrhage.

5a75df9883b0d9ea66000002	Which cancers compose Carney's triad?	New adrenal tumors have also been associated with nonhereditary Carney's triad. Carney designated the combination of 3 rare soft tissue tumors (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma) as a syndrome.  In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. A case of bilateral multiple pulmonary chondroma: necessity of follow-up for Carney's triad. We report a case of pulmonary bilateral multiple chondromas that were possibly an initial clinical presentation of Carney's triad.  These chondromas were possibly components of Carney's triad, because each nodule had a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and did not have an entrapped epithelium and fat. A curious association of three rare tumours was described by Carney in 1977. 'Carney's triad' characteristically includes multifocal pulmonary chondroma, gastric stromal sarcoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  We report a female teenager who presented with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach and a paraganglioneuroma. She later developed a pulmonary chondroma, fulfilling the requirements of Carney's triad. A 34-year-old man, who had undergone the gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and para-aortic paraganglioma 3 years before, was found to have a left lung tumor on a computed tomography. The tumor was revealed to be a pulmonary hamartoma, and diagnosed as Carney's triad. INTRODUCTION: Carney's triad is a rare pathogenic entity which consists of the association in young women of multiple condromatosis in the lung, gastric leiomyosarcoma, and extradrenal paraganglioma; although the presence of three at the same time is not required for its diagnosis. Interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) hyperplasia has been documented in conditions associated with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (familial GIST syndromes, Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease) and rarely in the vicinity of sporadic GISTs. Multiple gastric tumors and pararenal non functioning paraganglioma were found. No chondromas were detected. An incomplete Carney's Triad was diagnosed.  Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) occur mostly as sporadic solitary lesions involving the tubular GI tract and are only rarely associated with other benign or malignant neoplasms or occur as part of a multi-neoplastic disease as in the setting of Carney's triad and von Recklinghausen's disease. Carney's triad is a very unusual syndrome, associating three different tumours on the same patient, a young woman generally: a gastric leiomyoblastoma, a pulmonary chondroma and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  This report encourages clinicians to consider a diagnosis of Carney's triad in patients with multifocal gastric stromal sarcoma, extraadrenal paraganglioma (predominantly mediastinal), or pulmonary chondroma. Carney's triad represents the association of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extraadrenal paraganglioma. Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome. Carney's triad is a syndrome of unknown etiology, representing a combination of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, bronchial chondromas and vagal, adrenal or paraadrenal paragangliomas. Two of the Carney's triad components-the paragangliomas and the gastrointestinal stromal tumors-are potentially lethal. Carney's triad, a rare disorder affecting young females, is characterized by the presence of at least two of the three following neoplasms: gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma, extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and pulmonary chondroma. Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women. We communicate a case with the Carney triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondromatosis and extra-adrenal paraganglioma). The etiology of the Carney's triad (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas, and paragangliomas) is unknown, and only 57 cases have been reported since its identification in 1977. Carney's triad is defined by the coexistence of at least two of three rare disorders, including gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (malignant leiomyoblastoma), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma, most often extra-adrenal and functioning.

5a7486a90384be9551000003	Which molecules are inhibited by anticancer drug Dovitinib?	Dovitinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with FGFR pathway-amplified breast cancer. Dovitinib inhibits multiple tyrosine receptor kinases, predominantly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), but also FGFRs, and could be active in MPM. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. Dovitinib, a suppressor of FGFR activity, may be active in ACC. We tested dovitinib, an inhibitor of both FGF and VEGF receptors, in patients progressing on anti-VEGF treatment. Five HNSCC cell lines were characterized based on VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression by sqRT-PCR and treated with three different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nintedanib, dovitinib and pazopanib), all of which are effective against VEGFR and FGFR family members. PURPOSE: Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR.  .RESULTS: Four trials involving the selective VEGFR inhibitors axitinib, tivozanib and dovitinib were analysed, all using sorafenib as the comparator.  PURPOSE: Dovitinib (TKI258) is an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR β, and c-Kit.  Using this PDX model, we confirmed the ability of the FGFR inhibitors, ponatinib, dovitinib and BGJ398, to modulate FGFR signaling, inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma tumors harboring FGFR2 fusions. In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, dovitinib inhibits FGFR.  AZD4547, BGJ398 (infigratinib), Debio-1347 and dovitinib are FGFR1/2/3 inhibitors; BLU9931 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor; FIIN-2, JNJ-42756493, LY2874455 and ponatinib are pan-FGFR inhibitors. AZD4547, dovitinib and ponatinib are multi-kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2, and others.  In vitro, N87-TR cell lines demonstrated a higher sensitivity than did trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to the FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which reduced expression of pAKT, ZEB1, and cell migration. The current phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of dovitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced SCC of the lung. Dovitinib (TKI258) is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor currently in clinical phase I/II/III development for the treatment of various types of cancers.  We tested various T-ALL cell lines against a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 66 compounds targeting two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome and found that combined treatment of T-ALL cells with dovitinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and OP449 synergistically reduced the viability of all tested T-ALL cell lines.  We sought to identify fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib, and explore the mechanism of action of the drug-resistant mutations. Dovitinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, c-Kit and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1-3. Dovitinib (TKI258/CHIR258) is a multi-kinase inhibitor in phase III development for the treatment of several cancers. INTRODUCTION Erlotinib is a FDA approved small molecule inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and dovitinib is a novel small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of 2 FGFR inhibitors, the multikinase inhibitor dovitinib (TKI258) and the more selective FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398 for the treatment of endometrial cancer. PURPOSE Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR. The multiple kinase inhibitor dovitinib is currently under clinical investigation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).	[['VEGFR'], ['FGFR'], ['PDGFR'], ['KIT']]

Southern tick-associated rash illness and anaphylaxis to red meat following tick bites have been attributed to the lone star tick. Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) and the rash is called STARI (southern tick-associated rash illness). Amblyomma americanum (Lone star tick) is an important disease vector in the United States. It transmits several human pathogens, including the agents of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and southern tick-associated rash illness. E. chaffeensis is maintained in a complex cycle involving white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) as a primary reservoir and the lone star tick (LST; Amblyomma americanum) as a primary vector. Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, is the most common and most aggressive human biting tick in the Southeastern United States. It is known to transmit the agents of human ehrlichioses, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii.  Rickettsia parkeri is a member of the spotted fever group rickettsiae and causes a febrile illness in humans commonly referred to as "Tidewater spotted fever" or "R. parkeri rickettsiosis." Although the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum Koch, is the primary vector of R. parkeri, a small proportion of A. americanum have also been shown to harbor R. parkeri.

5a76344e9e632bc066000003	Which algorithms are used for compression of SAM files?	GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files The most popular format for genomic data is the SAM format, which contains information such as alignment, quality values, etc. These files are large (on the order of terabytes), which necessitates compression. In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode. The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations. Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data. Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data. In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data. One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available. Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of sequencing a genome. This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted. To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e.g. FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain). Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available. We describe CSAM (Compressed SAM format), a compression approach offering lossless and lossy compression for SAM files. GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files.

PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment. Methadone is an opioid prescribed for pain management and is also provided through opioid treatment programs to treat opioid use disorders. Fortunately, there are effective medications (ie, methadone, buprenorphine, and oral and injectable naltrexone) available for the treatment of opioid addiction.  We describe the major classes of drug treatments available, including opioid agonist (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM), antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) he development of buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, as an effective treatment for opioid addiction reopened the possibility for having a less burdensome oversight process, Although the synthetic opioid buprenorphine has been available clinically for almost 30 years, its use has only recently become much more widespread for the treatment of opioid addiction	[['methadone'], ['naloxone'], ['suboxone'], ['buprenorphine']]

5ac7185f0340b9f058000004	Which cellular functions are affected by lncRNA H19 in the heart?	In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose.  In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3, which might provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. LncRNA H19 inhibits autophagy by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The long non-coding RNA H19 promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis in dilated cardiomyopathy. H19 knockdown in the myocardium of DCM rats attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improved left ventricular structure and function. Adriamycin treatment was associated with elevated H19 and miR-675 expression and increased apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Moreover, H19 knockdown was found to increase PA2G4 expression and suppress apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin. In conclusion, our study suggests that H19/miR-675 axis is involved in the promotion of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by targeting PA2G4, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of adriamycin-induced DCM. Downregulation of long non-coding RNA H19 promotes P19CL6 cells proliferation and inhibits apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation via miR-19b-modulated Sox6. Biological function analysis showed that knockdown of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis. H19 suppressed miR-19b expression and miR-19b targeted Sox6, which inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in P19CL6 cells during late-stage cardiac differentiation. Downregulation of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation by regulating the negative role of miR-19b in Sox6 expression, which suggested that the manipulation of H19 expression could serve as a potential strategy for heart disease. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. A knockdown of H19 in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of NOTCH1 and decreased the level of RUNX2 and BMP2, 2 downstream targets repressed by NOTCH1. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented H19-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells Long noncoding RNA H19 controls DUSP5/ERK1/2 axis in cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. H19 ectopic overexpression reduces DUSP5 abundance and increases the proliferation of cardiac fibroblast, whereas H19 silencing causes the opposite effects. In a broader perspective, these results demonstrated that LncRNA H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.

5abcf755fcf4565872000028	Please list 3 diseases treated with Valtrex(valacyclovir)	Valaciclovir (Valtrex, Zelitrex), the L-valine ester of aciclovir, increases aciclovir bioavailability by 3- to 5-fold over that achievable with oral aciclovir. It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus therapie In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. alacyclovir is the only antiviral drug approved for a once-daily dose of suppressive therapy for genital herpes, as well as the only antiviral drug US FDA approved for a 3-day regimen of episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes. valacyclovir is also indicated in the reduction of the sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus infection and for the treatment of herpes labialis.  n herpes zoster, valacyclovir is more effective than acyclovir or placebo (and as equally effective as famciclovir) in shortening the length and severity of herpes zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia.  valacyclovir and famciclovir are efficacious and safe for the treatment of the first episode and recurrent genital herpes and are useful as suppressive therapy for individuals with frequent genital herpes recurrences. valacyclovir and famciclovir have been shown to speed the healing of herpes zoster, and data suggests that these agents also decrease associated acute and chronic pain in people of 50 years of age or older. Valaciclovir (Valtrex), the L-valyl ester of acyclovir, is undergoing clinical development for the treatment and suppression of herpesviral diseases. Valacyclovir is frequently prescribed to the elderly to treat diseases such as herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Over the past two decades, the treatment of these conditions has been transformed by guanosine nucleoside antivirals such as valacyclovir (Valtrex, a highly bioavailable prodrug of acyclovir (Zovirax, and famciclovir (Famvir), a highly bioavailable prodrug of penciclovir (Denavir).<br><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: We describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and other viral infections. In herpes zoster, valacyclovir is as effective as famciclovir and more effective than either placebo or acyclovir at facilitating cutaneous healing and healing of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia.

5ace20fa0340b9f05800000c	Which genes are responsible for the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans?	We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.  In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1.  Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Identification of a Tibetan-specific mutation in the hypoxic gene EGLN1 and its contribution to high-altitude adaptation. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion). The estimated selective intensity (0.029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (∼8,400 years ago).  Two functional loci in the promoter of EPAS1 gene involved in high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans. EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude.  HMOX2 Functions as a Modifier Gene for High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetans. In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans.  Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism. Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population.  Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration. Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.

5aaef38dfcf456587200000f	Please list 10 conditions which play a role in causing atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Multiple conditions like hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, sleep apnoea, and obesity play a role for the initiation and perpetuation of AF. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia worldwide with increasing frequency noted with age. Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation with a 16%-60% prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with known hyperthyroidism  Atrial fibrillation continues to be a challenging arrhythmia. There are some conventional, time-tested explanations of atrial fibrillation genesis, however some uncertainty of its complete understanding still exists. We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart disease The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. As the population ages, the burden of AF increases. t is estimated that this arrhythmia's suffers a significant increase throughout the entire life span, and that its highest raise occurs between the ages of 65 and 80.  Drug-induced tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmias with rapid ventricular response) are life-threatening and often cause syncope Atrial fibrillation is a growing health problem and the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of persons above the age of 65 years. It occurs very often in patients with congestive heart failure and the prevalence increases with the severity of the disease. The prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation increase with age. Cardiac arrhythmias are a major problem in elderly persons, because of the high prevalence of underlying heart disease and hypertension, Heavy alcohol use has been suspected to cause acute atrial fibrillation, Heavy alcohol use is an important potential etiology for acute atrial fibrillation; alcohol withdrawal may represent a particular risk for such alcohol-related atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease has the highest stroke risk (about 17 times greater than unaffected controls), but even with nonvalvular heart disease, the risk is increased fivefold hronic atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia affecting 2 to 4% of the population older than 60 years of age In western countries ischemic and hypertensive heart disease (including sick sinus syndrome) and alcohol (holiday heart syndrome) are numerically more important than the classical causes of atrial fibrillation--rheumatic heart disease and thyrotoxicosis- Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease.   Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythm disorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in adult population  isk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease.   Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Thus, pericarditis might play a role in the development of recent atrial fibrillation during the course of myocardial infarction. Recent atrial fibrillation may be a sign of pericardial effusion which may be otherwise silent. Some patients develop atrial fibrillation after any type of surgery, some patients develop atrial fibrillation only after cardiac surgery, and still other patients never develop postoperative atrial fibrillation Hypertension is known to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation Of the long list of various cardiac conditions associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic strokes, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cause.

5c55de1607647bbc4b00000a	List four features of the WHIM syndrome.	To test whether there may be an advantage of one approach over the other for WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome - a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by gain-of-function autosomal dominant mutations in chemokine receptor CXCR4 - we performed competitive transplantation experiments using both lethally irradiated WT (Cxcr4+/+) and unconditioned WHIM (Cxcr4+/w) recipient mice.  WHIM syndrome is a primary autosomal dominant immuno deficiency due to CXCR4 mutations characterized by mucocutaneous warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections and myelokathesis. WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disease, named after its main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis, which refers to abnormal accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. The Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, Myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in chemokine receptor CXCR4. WHIM syndrome is a condition in which affected persons have chronic peripheral neutropenia, lymphopenia, abnormal susceptibility to human papilloma virus infection, and myelokathexis. Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by neutropenia, lymphopenia, susceptibility to infections, and myelokathexis, which describes degenerative changes of mature neutrophils and hyperplasia of bone marrow myeloid cells.

Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Preattachment embryos at different times after ovulation (Day 8: n = 9; Day 10: n = 12; Day 12: n = 15) were analyzed for Xist RNA expression using quantitative and qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

5c0e82b2133db5eb7800002d	What forms part of the senescence associated secretory phenotype, or SASP?	SASP mediates chemoresistance and tumor-initiating-activity of mesothelioma cells Numerous activities of senescent cells depend on the aptitude of these cells to secrete myriads of bioactive molecules, a behavior termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) The SASP supports cell-autonomous functions like the senescence-associated growth arrest, and mediates paracrine interactions between senescent cells and their surrounding microenvironment. Cultures enriched with not-diploid cells acquired a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) characterized by IL1B, CXCL8, CCL2, TNF, CCL27 and other pro-inflammatory factors including a novel SASP component CLEC11A. Senescent cells secrete cytokines and other factors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that contribute to tumor suppression by enforcing arrest and recruiting immune cells that remove these damaged or oncogene-expressing cells from organisms. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether and how adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a major SASP component, can prevent the SASP Endothelial cell senescence is characterized by acquisition of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), able to promote inflammaging and cancer progression. We have shown that the mitochondria are essential for development of senescence and many of the associated phenotypes, including the often detrimental senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) The diverse arrays of proteins secreted by senescent cells have been described to influence aging and to have both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic influences on the surrounding microenvironment.

5c61f379e842deac67000006	Which de novo truncating mutations in WASF1 cause intellectual disability?	Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.

5c72d4c77c78d6947100007c	Which proteins form the nuclear pore basket in human cells?	Nup133 Is Required for Proper Nuclear Pore Basket Assembly and Dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells. Here we show that the NPC basket proteins Nup1 and Nup60 directly induce membrane curvature by amphipathic helix insertion into the lipid bilayer Moreover, the association of TREX-2 with the NPC requires the basket nucleoporins NUP153 and TPR, but is independent of transcription.   In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket components, were unevenly distributed in the NE and, unlike wild-type NPCs, were mobile within the NE Incorporation of the nuclear pore basket protein nup153 into nuclear pore structures is dependent upon lamina assembly: evidence from cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs. Using light and EM immunolocalization, we determined that mammalian Tpr is concentrated within the nuclear basket of the pore complex in a distribution similar to Nup153 and Nup98. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy localize vertebrate Nup93 at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear entry to the gated channel of the pore. Strikingly, Nup133 and Nup107 of the Nup107/160 subcomplex and Nup153 and Nup50 of the nuclear pore basket recruited a near full complement of nucleoporins to the LacO array. Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. Nup153 is a molecular constituent of the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that plays a critical role in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins. The nucleoporins Nup60p, Nup2p, and Nup1p form part of the nuclear basket structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear pore complex (NPC). By postembedding immunoelectron microscopy, we have mapped the positions of several human NPC proteins relative to the NPC core and its associated basket, including Nup93, Nup96, Nup98, Nup107, Nup153, Nup205, and the coiled coil-dominated 267-kDa protein Tpr. In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup153. When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. One such protein, the nucleoporin Nup153, is localized to the nuclear basket of the pore complex and has been shown to be a central component of the nuclear transport machinery. Here, one SLAP is identified as the nuclear pore complex protein Nup153, one member of the F/GXFG motif-containing nucleoporins.  Nup133 Is Required for Proper Nuclear Pore Basket Assembly and Dynamics in Embryonic Stem Cells.Nup133 belongs to the Y-complex, a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) scaffold.  The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring and import of a subset of nuclear proteins.The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large proteinaceous structure through which bidirectional transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (NE) takes place.  To further assess their contributions to NPC and basket architecture, the genes encoding Nup93, Nup96, Nup107, and Nup205 were posttranscriptionally silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, complementing recent RNAi experiments on Nup153 and Tpr. Immunogold-labeling for Nup98 also results in preferential labeling of NPC core regions, whereas Nup153 is shown to bind via its amino-terminal domain to the nuclear coaxial ring linking the NPC core structures and Tpr. Ulp1, whose maintenance at nuclear pores depends on the Nup84 complex, impacts on THO-dependent gene expression, whereas the nuclear basket-associated Mlp1/Pml39 proteins prevent pre-mRNA export at a later stage, contributing to mRNA quality control.

5c641179e842deac67000012	What are the effects of STEF depletion?	The mechanisms regulating the actin cap are currently poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that STEF/TIAM2, a Rac1 selective guanine nucleotide exchange factor, localises at the nuclear envelope, co-localising with the key perinuclear proteins Nesprin-2G and Non-muscle myosin IIB (NMMIIB), where it regulates perinuclear Rac1 activity. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap. STEF depletion drastically reduced dbcAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. STEF depletion and Rac1-N17 expression reduced cAMP-induced TC10 inactivation.

Deregulation of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK TAM family members AXL or TYRO3  receptors of the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer constitute the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) characterized by a conserved sequence within the kinase domain and adhesion molecule-like extracellular domains. The TYRO3, AXL (also known as UFO) and MERTK (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are aberrantly expressed in multiple haematological and epithelial malignancies. Gas6 was cloned and characterized in 1993 and found to be similar to the plasma anticoagulant protein S. Soon after it was recognized as a growth factor-like molecule, as it interacted with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the TAM family; Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. The TAM subfamily of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) contains three human proteins of therapeutical interest, Axl, Mer, and Tyro3. Increasing evidence shows that the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), which is expressed in macrophages, alleviates inflammatory responses through a negative feedback loop. Among the TAM family of RTKs, AXL (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase) only induces autophagy in macrophages after interaction with its ligand, GAS6 (growth arrest specific 6). A series of recent studies now consolidates the view that phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a common phospholipid constituent of membrane bilayers, is similarly repurposed for use as a signal between cells and that the ligands and receptors of the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are prominent transducers of this signal.

5c61bd04e842deac67000002	Which two drugs are included in the Entresto pill?	A novel antihypertensive drug, LCZ696 (Entresto®), has recently been introduced, which combines the action of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), effectively decreasing the blood pressure, with an inhibition of neprilysin, which is responsible for metabolizing natriuretic peptides exerting antihypertensive and antifibrotic effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENTRESTO-SAS trial is a 3-month, multicentric, prospective, open-label real-life cohort study. Patients eligible for sacubitril-valsartan treatment (i.e. adults with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) will be evaluated before and after 3 months of treatment (nocturnal ventilatory polygraphy, echocardiography, laboratory testing, and quality-of-life and SDB questionnaires).   We sought to assess in the ENTRESTO-SAS trial whether sacubitril-valsartan could improve the outcome of SDB in CHF patients. This positive change in regulatory perspective coupled with successful commercialization of valsartan-sacubitril co-crystal (Entresto, Novartis) has now brought co-crystals into focus, in both industries as well as academia. We present a case of a 61-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto; Novartis, Cambridge, MA) who developed profound hypotension after HT. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug with brand name Entresto (Sacubitril/Valsartan or LCZ696), an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs.

Thus studies were conducted to examine the effects of lumacaftor alone and lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor (i.e., ORKAMBI) on the ability of human CF ( del508Phe/ del508Phe) monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to phagocytose and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In recent years, two modulators, ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi), have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat CF patients with certain CFTR mutations.  Recently, ORKAMBI, a combination therapy that includes a corrector of the processing defect of F508del-CFTR (lumacaftor or VX-809) and a potentiator of channel activity (ivacaftor or VX-770), was approved for CF patients homozygous for this mutation.  The recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of lumacaftor combined with ivacaftor (Orkambi) targets patients with the F508del-CFTR.  In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), a combination drug that works on reversing the effects of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein.  Areas covered: In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission approved LUM/IVA (Orkambi), a CFTR modulator that includes both a CFTR corrector and potentiator, for CF patients homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation.  The combination therapy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi®) is approved for patients bearing the major cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation: ΔF508 It has been predicted that Orkambi® could treat patients with rarer mutations of similar "theratype"; however, a standardized approach confirming efficacy in these cohorts has not been reported.

Development of HPLC and LC-MS/MS methods for the analysis of ivacaftor, its major metabolites and lumacaftor in plasma and sputum of cystic fibrosis patients treated with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO.ORKAMBI (ivacaftor-lumacaftor [LUMA]) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor; IVA) are two new breakthrough cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs that directly modulate the activity and trafficking of the defective CFTR underlying the CF disease state.  In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), a combination drug that works on reversing the effects of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein.  The combination therapy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi®) is approved for patients bearing the major cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation: ΔF508 It has been predicted that Orkambi® could treat patients with rarer mutations of similar theratype; however, a standardized approach confirming efficacy in these cohorts has not been reported.

The NanoString nCounter Platform is a new and promising technology for measuring nucleic acid abundances. It has several advantages over PCR-based techniques, including avoidance of amplification, direct sequence interrogation and digital detection for absolute quantification. These features minimize aspects of experimental error and hold promise for dealing with challenging experimental conditions such as archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. However, systematic inter-sample technical artifacts caused by variability in sample preservation, bio-molecular extraction and platform fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data.RESULTS: To facilitate this process and to address these issues for NanoString datasets, we have written a pre-processing package called NanoStringNorm in the R statistical language.

Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial. METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or refractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominal or pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that would preclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded. Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion. Results: Evidence from four single-centre randomised controlled trials and now the multicentre Randomized Trial of Open versus Robotic Cystectomy (RAZOR) trial demonstrate the oncological equivalence of RARC to ORC.  The RAZOR (randomized open vs robotic cystectomy) trial: study design and trial update.

5c54224807647bbc4b000001	What are the roles of LEM-3?	LEM-3 is a midbody-tethered DNA nuclease that resolves chromatin bridges during late mitosis. Using C. elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide. LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer. The conserved LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease is involved in the combinatorial regulation of meiotic recombination repair and chromosome segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality. The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.

Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity.

UPDtool is a computational tool for detection and classification of uniparental disomy (UPD) in trio SNP-microarray experiments. The performance of the new algorithm, called "AsCNAR" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity of cancer genomes and should contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of human cancers. Our results were compared with both the gold standard, microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for UPD detection.

Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues. we identified the six-transmembrane protein STAMP2 as a critical modulator of this integrated response system of inflammation and metabolism in adipocytes.  Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice. Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues.  These results suggest that Stamp1 and Stamp2 play critical roles in adipogenesis, but through different mechanisms. CONTEXT Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice. These results suggest that STAMP2 is crucial for normal ASC conversion into adipocytes and their metabolic function, as well as their ability to facilitate PCa growth in vivo.

Until now, the role of uc.189 in human cancers remains undefined and the clinical significance of uc.189 in gynecological cancers remains unknown. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in gynecological cancers. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 243 samples including 116 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), 98 endometrial adenocarcinomas (EACs), 29 ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas(OCAs), and corresponding normal tissues. In CSCC, uc.189 expression was increased in 78.5% of cases (91/116), decreased in 4.3% (5/116), and unchanged in 17.2% (20/116). In EAC its expression was increased in 74.5% (73/98), decreased in 3.1% (3/98), and unchanged in 22.4% (22/98). Expression of uc.189 was increased in 23, and unchanged/decreased in 6, of 29 cases of ovarian cystoadenocarcinomas. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that over-expression of uc.189 predicted poor prognosis in CSCC and EAC.

Until now, the role of the UCE uc.189 in human cancers remains undefined and the clinical significance of uc.189 in esophageal cancers remains unknown. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients.

5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e	Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads	mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads? RNA-Seq is currently used routinely, and it provides accurate information on gene transcription. However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results.RESULTS: We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads?mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way. CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.

5c596ad686df2b9174000015	Which integrin genes are activated by the immune system in inflammatory bowel disease?	Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1).

5c72a9147c78d6947100006e	Which drugs are included in the Lonsurf pill?	The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Servier, the company manufacturing trifluridine and tipiracil (T/T; trade name: Lonsurf®), to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T compared with best supportive care (BSC) for metastatic colorectal cancer (third-line or later).  PURPOSE: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; TAS-102, Lonsurf®), a novel form of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), has shown clinical benefit in the global, phase III RECOURSE trial, regardless of patient age.  BACKGROUND: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, Lonsurf®), a novel oral anti-tumor agent combining an anti-neoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue (trifluridine, FTD) with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (tipiracil hydrochloride, TPI) presents a new treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.  These AEs may affect patient adherence, particularly with completely oral regimens, such as trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, Lonsurf®), an antimetabolite agent for patients with mCRC refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.  Trifluridine/tipiracil has recently been approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are refractory to or are not considered candidates for, current standard chemotherapy and biological therapy in the EU and USA and in unresectable advanced or recurrent CRC in Japan.  TAS-102 (Lonsurf) is an oral fluoropyrimidine that is formed by the combination of 2 active drugs: trifluridine (a nucleoside analog) and tipiracil hydrochloride (a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor). Evolocumab (Repatha) for patients with hypercholesterolemia whose condition has not been controlled by statins and other therapies; trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf) for metastatic colorectal cancer; and blood coagulation factor VIII (Nuwiq) for adults and children with hemophilia A. In May 2014, tablets containing both trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (Lonsurf® tablets) were launched in Japan ahead of other countries, for the treatment of advanced/relapsed unresectable colorectal cancer.

5c62a276e842deac6700000a	De novo mutations in which novel genes are involved in systemic lupus erythematosus?	De novo mutations implicate novel genes in systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the >80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-κB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033).

5c6b15467c78d69471000024	Mention computational tools that have been developed for alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites analysis	TAPAS: tool for alternative polyadenylation site analysis. We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly. PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants. Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response. IntMAP toolbox is available at http://compbio.cs.umn.edu/IntMAP/.

Split-networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that have proven to be a powerful tool in phylogenetics. Various ways have been developed for computing such networks, including split-decomposition, NeighborNet, QNet and FlatNJ. Some of these approaches are implemented in the user-friendly SplitsTree software package. However, to give the user the option to adjust and extend these approaches and to facilitate their integration into analysis pipelines, there is a need for robust, open-source implementations of associated data structures and algorithms. Here, we present SPECTRE, a readily available, open-source library of data structures written in Java, that comes complete with new implementations of several pre-published algorithms and a basic interactive graphical interface for visualizing planar split networks. SPECTRE also supports the use of longer running algorithms by providing command line interfaces, which can be executed on servers or in High Performance Computing environments. FlatNJ: a novel network-based approach to visualize evolutionary and biogeographical relationships. Split networks are a type of phylogenetic network that allow visualization of conflict in evolutionary data. We present a new method for constructing such networks called FlatNetJoining (FlatNJ). QNet: an agglomerative method for the construction of phylogenetic networks from weighted quartets. We present QNet, a method for constructing split networks from weighted quartet trees. QNet can be viewed as a quartet analogue of the distance-based Neighbor-Net (NNet) method for network construction. Just as NNet, QNet works by agglomeratively computing a collection of circular weighted splits of the taxa set which is subsequently represented by a planar split network.

5c88550075a4a5d219000008	List 3 apoE mimetics.	Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability.  Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2).  ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors.

5e493a3e6d0a277941000002	Which lncRNAS are regulated by SAM68?	As expected, downregulated genes were significantly associated with GO terms linked to cell migration, motility, and fat cell differentiation, while upregulated genes were mostly associated with GO terms linked to neurogenesis. Of the lncRNAs, we identified Hotair, Mir155hg, as well as two new lncRNAs (SR-lncRNA-1 and SR-lncRNA-2) that were regulated by Sam68, and contained consensus Sam68 binding sites. RNA stability assays showed that Sam68-deficiency decreased the half-life of Hotair, and increased the half-lives of Mir155hg and SR-lncRNA-2, while the stability of SR-lncRNA-1 was unaffected. Depletion of Hotair and SR-lncRNA-1 in wild type 3T3-L1 cells led to defects in adipogenesis, whereas depletion of SR-lncRNA-2 in Sam68-deficient 3T3-L1 cells partially rescued the adipogenesis defect observed in these cells. Collectively, our findings define a new role for Sam68 as a regulator of lncRNAs during adipogenic differentiation.

5e35c75d158f994d3a000001	List targeted genome editing methodologies	TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in the early-branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis. Non-bilaterian phyla represent key lineages for exploring the evolutionary history of early animals. However, despite an increasing number of sequenced genomes from early-branching metazoans, efficient and reproducible methodologies for analysis of gene function remain a major challenge. Here we report the utilization of the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems to induce targeted mutations and homologous recombination-mediated transgenesis in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We also present a new method to isolate genetically modified animals using engineered selection cassettes introduced by homologous recombination. Taken together, these methods will permit sophisticated gain- and loss-of-function analyses in Nematostella and perhaps other early metazoan species that allow for zygotic injection. Comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs on editing an integrated EGFP gene in the genome of HEK293FT cells. Genome editors such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs are at the forefront of research into methodologies for targeted modification of the mammalian genome. To date few comparative studies have been carried out to investigate the difference of genome editing characteristics between CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs. While the CRISPR/Cas9 system has overtaken TALENs as the tool of choice for most research groups working in this field, we hypothesized that there could be certain applications whereby the application of TALENs would have specific benefits. Here we compare CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN as tools for introducing site-specific editing events at an integrated EGFP gene in the genome of HEK293FT cells.RESULTS: Guide RNAs and TALEN pairs were designed to target two loci within the EGFP gene. We found that paired Cas9 nucleases induced targeted genomic deletion more efficiently and precisely than two TALEN pairs. However, when concurrently supplied with a plasmid template spanning the two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within EGFP, TALENs stimulated homology directed repair (HDR) more efficiently than CRISPR/Cas9 and caused fewer targeted genomic deletions.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the choice of genome editing tool should be determined by the desired genome editing outcome. Such a rational approach is likely to benefit research outputs for groups working in fields as diverse as modification of cell lines, to animal models for disease studies, or gene therapy strategies.

5d38673da1e1595105000002	Which micro-RNAs (miR) are associated with the human cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene promoter?	The mRNA stability factor HuR inhibits microRNA-16 targeting of COX-2. . We identified miR-16 to bind the COX-2 3'-UTR and inhibit COX-2 expression by promoting rapid mRNA decay. However, miR-143-5p alone directly targets COX-2, and it exhibits a stronger tumor suppressive effect than miR-143-3p. The NF-κB family member RelB regulates microRNA miR-146a to suppress cigarette smoke-induced COX-2 protein expression in lung fibroblasts. TargetScan analysis predicted COX-2 as a target of miR-26a and miR-26b. miR-26a/-26b decreased luciferase activity associated with COX-2-3'-UTR. icroRNA-26a/-26b-COX-2-MIP-2 Loop Regulates Allergic Inflammation and Allergic Inflammation-promoted Enhanced Tumorigenic and Metastatic Potential of Cancer Cells Downregulated microRNA-26a modulates prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting COX-2. microRNA-142-3p inhibits apoptosis and inflammation induced by bleomycin through down-regulation of Cox-2 in MLE-12 cells.  Up-regulation of Cox-2 and inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR were found in bleomycin-pretreated cells, while these abnormal regulations were partially abolished by miR-142-3p overexpression and NS-398. MicroRNA-144 is regulated by CP2 and decreases COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in mouse ovarian granulosa cells. overexpression of miR-144 significantly decreased the luciferase reporter activity under the control of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) or mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 4 (Smad4) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed COX-2 and Smad4 expression. In contrast, a miR-144 inhibitor increased COX-2 and Smad4 expression in mouse granulosa cells (mGCs The down-regulation of microRNA-137 contributes to the up-regulation of retinoblastoma cell proliferation and invasion by regulating COX-2/PGE2 signaling. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was a potential target gene of miR-137, which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, our results showed that miR-137 negatively regulated the expression of COX-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RB cells. MicroRNA-128 inhibits proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by targeting COX-2.  the inhibitory effects of miR-128 mimics on the invasion and proliferation of glioma cells were reversed by overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Our data showed that COX-2 was a candidate target of miR-128. Luciferase activity of 3'-UTR of COX-2 was reduced in the presence of miR-128 miR-128 obviously decreased COX-2 mRNA stability determined by real time PCR. Contrarily, we found that miR-128 inhibitor significantly increased the COX-2 mRNA expression, and elevated the protein expression of MMP9 and ki67, and promoted the proliferation of glioma cells. MicroRNA-146b-3p regulates the development and progression of cerebral infarction with diabetes through RAF1/P38MAPK/COX-2 signaling pathway Our data have implied that altered expression of miR-146b-3p is closely related to the progression and development of DCMI mediating the RAF/P38MAPK/COX-2 signal transduction pathway. MicroRNA-101 inhibits angiogenesis via COX-2 in endometrial carcinoma. Our results suggest that modulating miR-101 and COX-2 levels or their activity may be a potential therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer.

5e4609b83f54159529000005	List characteristic features of the Revesz syndrome.	PURPOSES: To inform about a case of Revesz syndrome (RS) with initial ophthalmological symptomatology of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye (LE). After the aplastic anemia had developed, RS was established.  In preoperative screening, thrombocytopenia was detected; later, severe pancytopenia developed. Considering the hematological findings and clinical appearance, we suspected RS, which was confirmed by genetic tests. CONCLUSIONS: RS is an extremely rare condition.  The initial symptomatology could be ophthalmological or hematological. The patient was found to have a TINF2 mutation consistent with a diagnosis of Revesz syndrome, a variant of dyskeratosis congenita. He underwent successful bone marrow transplantation, and on subsequent evaluation was found to have retinal hemorrhages, vessel sclerosis, and cotton wool spots in the right eye associated with peripheral retinal nonperfusion.  These "telomeropathies" also include Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH) and Revesz syndrome, which are severe forms of dyskeratosis congenita, as well as a subset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, aplastic anemia, and Coats' plus syndrome. Retinopathy has only rarely been reported in DC and HH, but is universally present in Coats' plus and Revesz syndromes.  Revesz syndrome, a subtype of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) caused by TINF2 mutation, combines marrow failure with exudative retinopathy, intracranial calcifications, and neurocognitive impairment. Revesz syndrome, a variant disorder, is characterized by retinopathy, aplastic anemia, nail dystrophy, and cerebellar hypoplasia.  A 5-year-old girl was admitted with pallor, hypopigmented sparse hair, tongue ulcers, atrophic nail changes, hypoplastic anemia and bilateral exudative retinopathy. A diagnosis of Revesz syndrome was made.  Revesz syndrome is a variant of dyskeratosis congenita characterized by aplastic anemia, retinopathy, and central nervous system abnormalities.

5d387360a1e1595105000007	What are the effects of CAMK4 inhibition?	CaMK4-dependent activation of AKT/mTOR and CREM-α underlies autoimmunity-associated Th17 imbalance  Here, we present evidence that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMK4) is increased and required during Th17 cell differentiation. Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator α (CREM-α) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation. CaMK4 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for Th17-driven autoimmune diseases. CAMK4 knockdown and kinase-dead mutant inhibited crocin-mediated HO-1 expression, Nrf2 activation, and phosphorylation of Akt, indicating that HO-1 expression is mediated by CAMK4 and that Akt is a downstream mediator of CAMK4 in crocin signaling CaMK4 inhibition significantly decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, and lactate, whereas it did not affect the levels of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates such as 6-Phospho-D-gluconate, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate	[['Th17 differentiation'], ['reduction of Il17 expression'], ['decreased activation of cAMP']]
5e4949d36d0a277941000006	List cohesinopathies	Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies. These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes.  A new study identifies homozygous missense mutations in SGOL1, which encodes a component of the cohesin complex, in a newly described disorder termed Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome. These findings implicate cohesin in the regulation of intrinsic cardiac and intestinal rhythm and further expand the growing group of disorders termed the cohesinopathies.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a frequently missed clinical entity with the typical symptom triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and dementia (Hakim's triad) and occurs mostly from the 6th decade of life onwards.  Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence combined with radiographic findings of ventriculomegaly and laboratory findings of normal cerebrospinal fluid pressures. Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies.

5e2fa276fbd6abf43b000035	What are manifestations of the Saint's Triad?	Yamanaka et al. described two case studies involving coexistent cholelithiasis, hiatal hernia, and umbilical hernias, and discussed clinical similarities with the classical features of the Saint's triad.  Umbilical hernia with cholelithiasis and hiatal hernia: a clinical entity similar to Saint's triad. We experienced two cases involving the simultaneous presence of cholelithiasis, hiatal hernia, and umbilical hernia. Both patients were female and overweight (body mass index of 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) and had a history of pregnancy and surgical treatment of cholelithiasis. Additionally, both patients had two of the three conditions of Saint's triad. In 1948, Saint's Triad, an aggregation of hiatus hernia (later, any primary hernia), gallstones, and diverticulosis coli, was introduced.  Remarkably, clinical studies of Saint's triad extending over the past 60 years have repeatedly demonstrated a highly significant relationship between colonic diverticula and abdominal herniae.  BACKGROUND: Sixty years ago, Saint's triad (hiatus hernia, diverticulosis of the colon, and gallbladder disease) was first described in three patients. In connection with two cases authors review our current body of knowledge on Saint's triad that means the concomitant occurrence of cholelithiasis, hiatus hernia and colonic diverticulosis. The investigation revealed 7 cases of Saint's triad (1.02%) and 86 cases of bifocal associations; 59 cholelithiasis + diverticulosis, 17 cholelithiasis + Hiatus hernia; 10 diverticulosis + hernia. The morphologic changes are described found in the gallbladder of a female patient, aged 40; she had xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis secondary to cholelithiasis combined with a hiatal hernia and multiple duodenal diverticulae (Saint's triad). A quarter of a century ago Professor C. F. M. Saint of the University of Cape Town noted the occasional association of diverticular disease, hiatus hernia, and gallstones in a patient. Authors stress that in the event of simultaneous symptoms suggestive of atypic cholelithiasis , colonic diverticulosis and hiatus hernia one has to consider a potential Saint 's triad In connection with two cases authors review our current body of knowledge on Saint 's triad that means the concomitant occurrence of cholelithiasis , hiatus hernia and colonic diverticulosis In 1948 , Saint 's Triad , an aggregation of hiatus hernia ( later , any primary hernia) , gallstones , and diverticulosis coli , was introduced CONCLUSIONS Herniosis, the systemic connective tissue disease known to cause diverticulosis and herniae, may be responsible for Saint's triad.

5e36e093b5b409ea5300000f	List Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated during cytokinesis	The final event of the eukaryotic cell cycle is cytokinesis, when two new daughter cells are born. How the timing and execution of cytokinesis is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we show that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, together with upregulation of its counteracting phosphatase Cdc14, controls each of the sequential steps of cytokinesis, including furrow ingression, membrane resolution and cell separation in budding yeast. We use phosphoproteome analysis of mitotic exit to identify Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated at the time of cytokinesis. We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators. Our results suggest that cytokinesis is coordinately controlled by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk together with its counteracting phosphatase and that it is executed by concerted dephosphorylation of Cdk targets involved in several cell biological processes. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators.	[['Aip1'], ['Ede1'], ['Inn1']]
5d2f3a5db3a6380763000001	Which drugs used in the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus are targeting granulocytes?	After treatment with any of the xenobiotic compounds, immunolabeling demonstrated the additional presence of granulocytes in foci, and, at electron microscope level neutrophils, eosinophils and their precursors were clearly recognizable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination in patients with ATM in the course of SLE indicate usually pleocytosis with prevalence of granulocytes, increased protein levels, low glucose levels, significantly hindering differential diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Granulocytes isolated from 17 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had a significantly increased (P less than 0.001) mean initial rate of phagocytosis (0.91 min-u).  Both syndromes were refractory to conventional treatment but responded to rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Although some Fc-independent loss of CD22 is expected from internalization by epratuzumab, the concurrent and prominent reduction of CD19, CD21, and CD79b is Fc dependent and results from their transfer from epratuzumab-opsonized B cells to FcγR-expressing monocytes, natural killer cells, and granulocytes via trogocytosis.

5e49c88c6d0a277941000013	List the members of a network of noncoding regulatory RNAs that play a role in the mammalian brain	Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles. Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs-a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs-using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.	[['long ncRNA Cyrano'], ['miR-7 miRNA'], ['Cdr1as circular RNA'], ['miR-671 miRNA']]

We previously isolated the SKN7 gene in a screen designed to isolate new components of the G1-S cell cycle transcription machinery in budding yeast. We have now found that Skn7 associates with Mbp1, the DNA-binding component of the G1-S transcription factor DSC1/MBF To gain more insight into the G(1)/S circuitry, we characterized Swi6p, Swi4p and Mbp1p, the closest orthologues of SBF (Swi6p and Swi4p) and MBF (Swi6p and Mbp1p) components in S. cerevisiae The G(1)/S transition is a critical control point for cell proliferation and involves essential transcription complexes termed SBF and MBF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or MBF in Schizosaccharomyces pombe In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G1/S transcription factors MBF and SBF regulate a large family of genes important for entry to the cell cycle and DNA replication and repair.

5e30ee25fbd6abf43b00003f	List features of the SAM syndrome.	Severe skin dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a rare life-threatening inherited condition caused by bi-allelic mutations in DSG1 encoding desmoglein 1.  Recently, homozygous mutations in the desmoglein-1 (DSG1) gene and heterozygous mutation in the desmoplakin (DSP) gene have been demonstrated to be associated with severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 615508). Monoallelic desmoglein 1 mutations have been known for many years to cause striate palmoplantar keratoderma, but only recently, biallelic loss-of-function mutations were associated with a new disorder, designated as SAM syndrome (comprising severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting) in two consanguineous families. BACKGROUND: Severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a recently recognized syndrome caused by mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene (DSG1). Here we describe a new syndrome featuring severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM syndrome) caused by homozygous mutations in DSG1. Severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a recently recognized syndrome caused by mutations in the desmoglein 1 (DSG1) and desmoplakin (DSP) genes. Severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome caused by de novo mutation in the DSP gene misdiagnosed as generalized pustular psoriasis and treatment of acitretin with gabapentin.

The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy. ical; CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477826 .). The first data from the phase III CheckMate-227 trial of ipilimumab plus nivolumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer suggests that the two drugs boost progression-free survival in patients with a high tumor mutation burden.  Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; NCT02477826), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; NCT02366143).

5e307a05fbd6abf43b000036	Which algorithms have been developed for analysing CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens data?	HiTSelect: a comprehensive tool for high-complexity-pooled screen analysis. Genetic screens of an unprecedented scale have recently been made possible by the availability of high-complexity libraries of synthetic oligonucleotides designed to mediate either gene knockdown or gene knockout, coupled with next-generation sequencing. However, several sources of random noise and statistical biases complicate the interpretation of the resulting high-throughput data. We developed HiTSelect, a comprehensive analysis pipeline for rigorously selecting screen hits and identifying functionally relevant genes and pathways by addressing off-target effects, controlling for variance in both gene silencing efficiency and sequencing depth of coverage and integrating relevant metadata. We document the superior performance of HiTSelect using data from both genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 screens. HiTSelect is implemented as an open-source package, with a user-friendly interface for data visualization and pathway exploration. Binary executables are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hitselect/, and the source code is available at https://github.com/diazlab/HiTSelect. MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential  genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout  screens. We propose the Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) method for prioritizing single-guide RNAs, genes and pathways in genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens. MAGeCK demonstrates better performance compared with existing methods, identifies both positively and negatively selected genes simultaneously, and reports robust results across different experimental conditions. Using public datasets, MAGeCK identified novel essential genes and pathways, including EGFR in vemurafenib-treated A375 cells harboring a BRAF mutation. MAGeCK also detected cell type-specific essential genes, including BCR and ABL1, in KBM7 cells bearing a BCR-ABL fusion, and IGF1R in HL-60 cells, which depends on the insulin signaling pathway for proliferation.

5e369ecfb5b409ea53000002	List T-UCRs that have been implicated in breast cancer	Ultraconserved long non-coding RNA uc.63 in breast cancer. We found that overexpression of one specific T-UCRs named uc.63 is associated with bad outcome in luminal A subtype of breast cancer patients. uc.63 is localized in the third intron of exportin-1 gene (XPO1) and is transcribed in the same orientation of its host gene. Interestingly, silencing of uc.63 induces apoptosis in vitro. However, silencing of host gene XPO1 does not cause the same effect suggesting that the transcription of uc.63 is independent of XPO1. Our results reveal an important role of uc.63 in promoting breast cancer cells survival and offer the prospect to identify a signature associated with poor prognosis. uc.38 induces breast cancer cell apoptosis via PBX1. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes. These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis. Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown. The expression of uc.38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. However, uc.38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages. Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc.38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Thus, uc.38 suppressed breast cancer. Additional experiments revealed that uc.38 negatively regulated the expression of the pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) protein and subsequently affected the expression of Bcl-2 family members, ultimately inducing breast cancer cell apoptosis. Describing the uc.38/PBX1 axis has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in breast cancer apoptosis and has suggested that this axis is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

5e36ad01b5b409ea53000006	Which T-UCRs have been implicated in gastric cancer?	Transcribed ultraconserved noncoding RNA uc.160 acts as a negative regulator in gastric cancer. uc.160 was found to be a suppressive factor of cancer development, but its role has not been fully elucidated.METHODS: The uc.160 expression was examined in gastric cancer tissues and established cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. PTEN levels were detected by Western blotting. Anti-tumor effects of uc.160 were further explored in tumor transplantation models.RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively. Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, uc.160 positively regulated the tumor suppressor protein PTEN. Interestingly, uc.160 was inhibited by microRNA miR-155 that is also a negative regulator of gastric cancer.CONCLUSION: uc.160 is significantly down-regulated in gastric carcinomas and can inhibit the tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that uc.160 may be used as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of gastric malignancies. Expression and function of Uc.160+, a transcribed ultraconserved region, in gastric cancer. BACKGROUND: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved among the orthologous regions in most vertebrates. It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC. We investigated the transcriptional levels of representative 26 T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differently expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and gastric cancer (GC). A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the downregulation of Uc.158+A expression by a DNA methylation-associated mechanism, which was restored by 5-Aza-dC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) treatment. Bisulfite genomic sequencing using cell lines and tissue samples demonstrated cancer-specific CpG hypermethylation in both GC and PCa. However, Uc.416+A was only overexpressed in GC and we identified an miR-153 binding site in the possible regulatory region of Uc.416+A using online databases. Along with a forced expression or knockdown of miR-153 in MKN-74 GC cells, the transcriptional levels of Uc.416+A were significantly disturbed. A luciferase reporter gene assay supported the direct regulation of Uc.416+A expression by miR-153. Furthermore, Uc.416+A was associated with cell growth through the regulation of IGFBP6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6) in GC. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.

RESULTS uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively. Over-expression of uc.160 in SGC-7901 and AGS gastric cancer cells significantly suppressed their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC. METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of Uc.416+A in GC, which suggests that our approach would provide new insights into functional studies of T-UCRs in cancer biology. METHODS: The uc.160 expression was examined in gastric cancer tissues and established cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological function of gastric cancer cells with uc.160 over-expression were investigated, and the interaction between uc.160 and microRNA miR-155 was examined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: uc.160 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines as compared to adjacent normal tissues and immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1), respectively.

Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of 34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209. SweeD: likelihood-based detection of selective sweeps in thousands of genomes. It analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial extension of the widely used SweepFinder program The sequential version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and, more importantly, is able to analyze thousands of sequences. We also provide a parallel implementation of SweeD for multi-core processors. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests Additionally, we summarize the results of comparisons among four open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, and OmegaPlus) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, both SFS- and LD-based methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. RAiSD detects positive selection based on multiple signatures of a selective sweep and SNP vectors. We present RAiSD (Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection), an open-source software that implements a novel, to our knowledge, and parameter-free detection mechanism that relies on multiple signatures of a selective sweep via the enumeration of SNP vectors.

Assessment of EGFR mutations in circulating tumor cell preparations from NSCLC patients by next generation sequencing: toward a real-time liquid biopsy for treatment. We report for the first time that the CellSearch System coupled with NGS is a very sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for EGFR mutation analysis in CTC preparations with potential clinical impact. In this respect, mutation analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be desirable since they may provide real-time information on patient's disease status. Exosomal miRNA Analysis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients' Plasma Through qPCR: A Feasible Liquid Biopsy Tool. These plasma-isolated exosomes can be used as a non-invasive and repeatable way for the detection and follow-up of these biomarkers. Liquid biopsy reflected spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the tumor under treatment pressure. We provide the proof-of-concept that the complementary use of ctDNA and ctcDNA represents a reliable, minimally invasive and dynamic tool for a more comprehensive view of tumor evolution. The isolation and analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA in plasma is a powerful tool with considerable potential to improve clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types, including NSCLC In summary, the panel concluded that liquid biopsy approaches have significant potential to improve patient care, and immediate implementation in the clinic is justified in a number of therapeutic settings relevant to NSCLC.

5e2b0d167d50947c2f000002	Which disorders are caused by de novo mutations in ZSWIM6?	A Recurrent De Novo Nonsense Variant in ZSWIM6 Results in Severe Intellectual Disability without Frontonasal or Limb Malformations. A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.  We show that the c.2737C>T variant does not trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the ZSWIM6 mRNA in affected individual-derived cells. This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect. This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes. Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis. Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND) is a rare disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial, brain, and limb malformations, including frontonasal dysplasia, interhemispheric lipoma, agenesis of the corpus callosum, tibial hemimelia, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, and intellectual disability. Exome sequencing of one trio and two unrelated probands revealed the same heterozygous variant (c.3487C>T [p. Arg1163Trp]) in a highly conserved protein domain of ZSWIM6; this variant has not been seen in the 1000 Genomes data, dbSNP, or the Exome Sequencing Project. Sanger validation of the three trios confirmed that the variant was de novo and was also present in a fourth isolated proband. In situ hybridization of early zebrafish embryos at 24 hr postfertilization (hpf) demonstrated telencephalic expression of zswim6 and onset of midbrain, hindbrain, and retinal expression at 48 hpf. Immunohistochemistry of later-stage mouse embryos demonstrated tissue-specific expression in the derivatives of all three germ layers. qRT-PCR expression analysis of osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines available from two probands was suggestive of Hedgehog pathway activation, indicating that the ZSWIM6 mutation associated with AFND may lead to the craniofacial, brain and limb malformations through the disruption of Hedgehog signaling. A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect. We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c.2737C>T [p.Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations. Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis . A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect. A single recurrent heterozygous missense substitution in ZSWIM6, encoding a protein of unknown function, was previously shown to underlie this disorder in four unrelated cases.

5c7a4a31d774d04240000006	Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?	PD-L1 expression has shown a positive association with response to PD-1 inhibition in noncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g., melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, and is discussed as a potential predictive biomarker for patient selection in these tumor types.  In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development. Emerging data suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1 by IHC have improved clinical outcomes with anti-PD-1-directed therapy, but the presence of robust responses in some patients with low levels of expression of these markers complicates the issue of PD-L1 as an exclusionary predictive biomarker.  The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cells it is not clear whether expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response.  In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologic features, such as the composition and amount of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status. PD-L1 expression is likely an imperfect predictive biomarker for patient selection and association with other markers of the tumor immune microenvironment will be probably necessary in the future. Taking this data in account, PD-L1 overexpression could not be currently considered a robust biomarker to tailor the immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment. Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. I However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to be confirmed by larger studies. . Although the most studied biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. PD-L1: a novel prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker.  Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of CM aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose. We question the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker in gastroesophageal cancers, as there are fundamental differences in PD-L1 expression between NSCLC and gastroesophageal cancers. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Breaking the biomarker code: PD-L1 expression and checkpoint inhibition in advanced NSCLC. PD-L1 Expression in Carcinosarcomas of the Gynecologic Tract: A Potentially Actionable Biomarker. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker. Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges.

5e52c1fd6d0a27794100004c	List types of cancer where TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16) is involved	Expression of TBC1D16 Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy with high recurrence and poor prognosis duo to the lack of effective biomarkers. TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16), a GTPase-activating protein, is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of TBC1D16 in EOC remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression and prognostic significance of TBC1D16 in EOC and its relationship with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The tissue specimens included 156 histologically confirmed EOC and 30 normal ovarian tissues. The expression of TBC1D16 and VEGF was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the immunoreactive score was calculated with signal intensity and percentage of positive cells. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as "high expression," compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). The Chi-square test showed that high TBC1D16 expression was related to advanced pT stages (P = 0.029), but not correlated with other clinical features. Moreover, the TBC1D16 expression was significantly higher in EOC specimens with low VEGF expression (P < 0.001). Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, high expression of TBC1D16 was significantly correlated with good overall survival (OS). In conclusion, TBC1D16 is a predictive marker for favorable prognosis of EOC. Epigenetic activation of a cryptic TBC1D16 transcript enhances melanoma progression by targeting EGFR. Metastasis is responsible for most cancer-related deaths, and, among common tumor types, melanoma is one with great potential to metastasize. Here we study the contribution of epigenetic changes to the dissemination process by analyzing the changes that occur at the DNA methylation level between primary cancer cells and metastases. We found a hypomethylation event that reactivates a cryptic transcript of the Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D16 (TBC1D16-47 kDa; referred to hereafter as TBC1D16-47KD) to be a characteristic feature of the metastatic cascade. This short isoform of TBC1D16 exacerbates melanoma growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. By combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified RAB5C as a new TBC1D16 target and showed that it regulates EGFR in melanoma cells. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. IHC results showed that TBC1D16 and VEGF were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as "high expression," compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). Expression of TBC1D16 Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer . Based on the immunoreactive score , TBC1D16 expression in EOC was categorized as " high expression , " compared with normal ovarian tissues ( P < 0.05) .  In addition, hypomethylation of TBC1D16 was observed in multiple tumours, including a breast cancer primary/metastasis pair, and to a lesser degree in melanoma, although again not all tumours or cancer primary/metastasis pairs exhibited altered patterns of methylation. BACKGROUND Characteristic DNA methylation differences have been identified between primary and metastatic melanomas at EBF3 and/or TBC1D16 gene loci.

Here we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the Slc25a46 gene that causes lethal neuropathology in mice. Mutant mice manifest the main clinical features identified in patients, including ataxia, optic atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia, which were completely rescued by expression of the human ortholog. Histopathological analysis revealed previously unseen lesions, most notably disrupted cytoarchitecture in the cerebellum and retina and prominent abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction. A distinct lymphoid phenotype was also evident.

5e5015436d0a277941000037	Which are the databases for intrinsic protein disorders?	A comprehensive assessment of long intrinsic protein disorder from the DisProt database. Intrinsic disorder (ID), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput. Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.Results: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.Availability and implementation: The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/. MobiDB: a comprehensive database of intrinsic protein disorder annotations. Disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous processes within an organism and to the determination of a protein's biological role. The most common source for protein disorder annotations, DisProt, covers only a fraction of the available sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures. Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding the content provided by already existing sources. In addition to the DisProt and PDB X-ray structures, we have added experimental information from NMR structures and five different flavours of two disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit manual annotations through a submission form. MobiDB features experimental annotations for 17 285 proteins, covering the entire PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database, with 565 200 annotated sequences. Depending on the disorder flavour, 6-20% of the residues are predicted as disordered.

To that effect, targeted therapies to EGFR such as Cetuximab, Panitumumab-monoclonal antibodies and Gefitinib, Erlotinib-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have had success in therapeutic scenarios. Two important strategies that have attenuated lung cancers were through treatments with EGFR-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, or EGFR-neutralizing antibodies, cetuximab and bevacizumab.  The best known targeted therapies include: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, zalutumumab and nimotuzumab), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, afatinib and dacomitinib) EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) (erlotinib and gefitinib), of second-generation EGFR-TKI (afatinib) plus/minus the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, and of third-generation EGFR-TKI (osimertinib). Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach.

5e30f8abfbd6abf43b000047	Which molecules are inhibited by Gilteritinib?	ASP2215 (gilteritinib) is a novel, dual FLT3/AXL inhibitor with promising early phase trial data (NCT02014558).  Ex vivo exposure (n = 30) to FLT3 inhibitors, in particular to the FLT3-specific inhibitor gilteritinib, showed that colony-forming capacity was significantly more reduced in FLT3-ITD-AR ≥ 0.5 compared with ITD-AR-low and ITD- patient samples (P < .001).  Furthermore, overexpression of Pim-1 in 32D/TKD enhanced the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway and partially protected it from the PI3K/Akt inhibitors or the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib to confer the resistance to PI3K/Akt inhibitors.  Finally, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 80 patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed/refractory AML participating in a trial of a novel FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, and demonstrated a relationship between the mutation burden, as detected by the assay, and overall survival.  Gilteritinib, a novel, highly specific, potent fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/AXL inhibitor, demonstrated antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Combinations of an AXL inhibitor, cabozantinib or gilteritinib, and an EGFR-TKI were more effective against HCC78R cells than monotherapy with an EGFR-TKI or AXL inhibitor.  Internal tandem duplication (ITD) in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Quizartinib, gilteritinib, and midostaurin are inhibitors against FLT3-ITD that have good efficacy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients.  In this review, we summarized the preclinical and clinical studies on new FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib, lestaurtinib, sunitinib, tandutinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib, crenolanib, cabozantinib, Sel24-B489, G-749, AMG 925, TTT-3002, and FF-10101.

In the FLT3 signaling analyses, gilteritinib inhibited FLT3 __sup__ wt __end_sup__  and FLT3-ITD to a similar degree in HEK293 and Ba/F3 cells, and similarly suppressed FLT3 downstream signaling molecules (including ERK1/2 and STAT5) in both the presence and absence of FL in MOLM-13 cells. Effect of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) ligand (FL) on antitumor activity of gilteritinib, a FLT3 inhibitor, in mice xenografted with FL-overexpressing cells. We aimed to assess the highly selective oral FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

In contrast to other FLT3 inhibitors, FL stimulation had little effect on growth inhibition or apoptosis induction by gilteritinib. Here, we investigated the effect of FL on the efficacy of gilteritinib, a FLT3 inhibitor, in AML-derived cells in vitro and in mice. Gilteritinib, a FLT3/AXL inhibitor, shows antileukemic activity in mouse models of FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The decreased FLT3 activity and high intratumor distribution of gilteritinib translated to tumor regression and improved survival in xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation models of FLT3-driven AML. These results indicate that gilteritinib may be an important next-generation FLT3 inhibitor for use in the treatment of FLT3 mutation-positive AML. Gilteritinib (Xospata®) is an orally available small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Astellas Pharma in collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) harbouring FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations. Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246).

5e4163b848dab47f2600000f	List 3 human diseases caused by  viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.	: Previous controversy was generated over the hypothesis that a paramyxovirus such as measles Measles are a systemic infectious disease caused by a single stranded ribonucleic acid virus (measles virus) from the paramyxovirus family. Mumps is a Paramyxoviridae virus.  Since chronic paramyxovirus infection with measles is known to be accompanied by increased production of antiviral antibodies Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus which causes fatal encephalitis in up to 75% of infected humans.  Measles is caused by the paramyxovirus which spreads through airborne droplets Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is classified as a member of the superfamily Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae. Many of these identified genes were also required for infection by two other NS RNA viruses, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus of the Arenaviridae family and human parainfluenza virus type 3 of the Paramyxoviridae family. Measles virus ( MeV) , a highly contagious member of the Paramyxoviridae family , causes measles in humans .  The human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) is a newly reported respiratory virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that has been associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children .  Two members of the morbillivirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae , canine distemper virus ( CDV ) and measles virus ( MV) , are well-known for their ability to cause a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS in their natural hosts , dogs and humans , respectively .  Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is the single most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children , yet no highly effective treatment or vaccine is available.  Human respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) , a member of the Paramyxoviridae family , is the most important viral agent of pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide.  Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) , an RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae , causes respiratory disease in humans .  Measles virus ( MV ) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and an important human pathogen causing strong immunosuppression in affected individuals and a considerable number of deaths worldwide.  Hendra ( HeV ) and Nipah ( NiV ) viruses ( genus Henipavirus ( HNV; family Paramyxoviridae ) are emerging zoonotic agents that can cause severe respiratory distress and acute encephalitis in humans .  Many of the common respiratory illnesses of infancy and childhood are caused by viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family, in particular measles virus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI3). Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The large virus family Paramyxoviridae includes some of the most significant human and livestock viruses, such as measles-, distemper-, mumps-, parainfluenza-, Newcastle disease-, respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumoviruses.

5e9206642d3121100d000007	List the proteins defining the triple negative breast cancer.	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer (BC) that does not express the oestrogen and the progesterone receptors and the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). The so called "Triple Negative Breast Cancer" (TNBC) represents approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a diverse and heterogeneous group of tumors that by definition lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and amplification of the HER-2 gene.

601c18eb1cb411341a000010	Variants in which genes cause nonsyndromic retinal degeneration?	DYNC2H1 hypomorphic or retina-predominant variants cause nonsyndromic retinal degeneration. Four novel DYNC2H1 variants (V1, g.103327020_103327021dup; V2, g.103055779A>T; V3, g.103112272C>G; V4, g.103070104A>C) and one previously reported variant (V5, g.103339363T>G) were identified. In proband 1 (V1/V2), V1 was predicted to introduce a premature termination codon (PTC), whereas V2 disrupted the exon 41 splice donor site causing incomplete skipping of exon 41. V1 and V2 impaired dynein-2 motility in vitro and perturbed IFT88 distribution within cilia. V3, homozygous in probands 2-4, is predicted to cause a PTC in a retina-predominant transcript. Analysis of retinal organoids showed that this new transcript expression increased with organoid differentiation. V4, a novel missense variant, was in trans with V5, previously associated with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD).CONCLUSION: The DYNC2H1 variants discussed herein were either hypomorphic or affecting a retina-predominant transcript and caused nonsyndromic IRD. Dynein variants, specifically DYNC2H1 variants are reported as a cause of non syndromic IRD. IFT81 as a Candidate Gene for Nonsyndromic Retinal Degeneration. Compound heterozygous mutations in IFT81, including one nonsense (c.1213C>T, p.R405*) and one missense variant (c.1841T>C, p.L614P), were identified in a nonsyndromic CRD proband. Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by mRNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity.Conclusions: Consistent with the function of the IFT-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core IFT-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of IFT-B components. Defects in USH2A cause both isolated retinal disease and Usher syndrome (ie, retinal disease and deafness). To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073 G>A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156 G>A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3 T>A; and c.12575 G>A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting. Null mutations in the ABHD12 gene lead to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease including polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract. Our study allowed us to report 5 new mutations in ABHD12. This is the first time missense mutations have been described for this gene. Furthermore, these findings are expanding the spectrum of phenotypes associated with ABHD12 mutations ranging from PHARC syndrome to a nonsyndromic form of retinal degeneration.

GRIA3 missense mutation is cause of an x-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. We report a patient carrying a hemizygous missense variant c.2359 G > A (p.Glu787Lys) inGRIA3 gene. Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations.RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus. In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined. Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks. Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases. Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events. The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor. Severity of ID ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders. Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia.CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants. Larger investigations will better define the prevalence of epilepsy, the epileptic phenotype, and syndromic features underlying GRIA3 variants. Missense variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are intracellular proteins which regulate voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the brain and other tissues. FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function.

In this study, we first showed that as compared with SCUBE1 or SCUBE3, SCUBE2 is the most potent modulator of IHH signaling in vitro. In addition, gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SCUBE2 exerted an osteogenic function by enhancing Ihh-stimulated osteoblast differentiation in the mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells. Consistent with these in vitro studies and the prominent roles of Ihh in coordinating skeletogenesis, genetic ablation of Scube2 (-/-) caused defective endochondral bone formation and impaired Ihh-mediated chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation as well as osteoblast differentiation of -/- bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal-cell cultures.

ABO blood type is associated with renal outcomes in patients with IgA nephropathy. staining for alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine and alpha-galactose, the terminal sugars in blood group A and B antigens respectively, corresponded to a large extent with ABO blood type. One  e, we describe the history and possible functions of the histoblood ABO group and then provide evidence for a role of blood group antigens in the most common cancer types worldwide using both blood type and SNP data. We contrary to the situation in the fetal and adult hamster pancreas, the induced pancreatic lesion expresses antigens with human blood group type specificities, including A, B, H, Leb, Lex, and Ley, antigens that are expressed, however, by fetal and adult duodenal epithelium. Considering the ori ically, we characterized and statistically evaluated the expression of histo-blood group (A, B, O) antigens on N-and O-linked glycans from BEC membrane proteins of various individuals that represented different blood group type and secretor status using a porous graphitic carbon liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PGC-LC-ESI-MS) based glycomics approach.

Endothel Human blood group polymorphisms are known to be determined by the expression of A, B or H antigens and the Lewis antigens. Protection against microbial infections has been associated with inheritance of polymorphisms in genes encoding and regulating the expression of ABH and Lewis antigens in bodily secretions and epithelial tissue surfaces, subsequently resulting in the presentation of different glycosylated terminal antigens on the cell surface. The expression of blood group-related antigens (A, B, H, Lewis(a), Lewis(b), Lewis(x), Lewis(y), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen) was investigated immunohistochemically in 75 cases of cholangiocarcinoma (31 peripheral type and 44 hilar type). Expression of blood group-related antigens ABH, Lewis A, Lewis B, Lewis X, Lewis Y, and CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer cells in comparison with the patient's blood group type. The immunohistological distribution of blood group (BG)-related antigens including A, B, H type 2, and sialylated Lex in lung adenocarcinomas was examined using monoclonal antibodies. Blood group A, B, H, Le, Leb, Lex, and Ley antigenicity as well as the expression of CA 19-9 were examined in pancreatic cancer specimens from 30 patients, using monoclonal antibodies to the respective antigen and immunohistochemical techniques, and the findings were correlated with the blood group types (ABO and Lewis) of the individuals.

5fdb2f77a43ad31278000013	Which computational methods are used for the definition of synteny?	Domain team: synteny of domains is a new approach in comparative genomics. The automated and fast detection of domain teams is implemented in the DomainTeam software. In this chapter, we describe the procedure to run DomainTeam. Cinteny allows one to automatically compare multiple genomes and perform sensitivity analysis for synteny block detection and for the subsequent computation of reversal distances.  Here we present the SynBlast pipeline that is designed to construct and evaluate local synteny information. OrthoClusterDB is a new online platform for the identification and visualization of synteny blocks. OrthoClusterDB consists of two key web pages: Run OrthoCluster and View Synteny. For both Run OrthoCluster and View Synteny, identified synteny blocks can be browsed at the whole genome, chromosome, and individual gene level. OrthoClusterDB is freely accessible OrthoCluster for the detection of synteny blocks among multiple genomes. OrthoClusterDB provides a Web interface for running OrthoCluster with user-defined datasets and parameters, as well as for browsing and downloading precomputed synteny blocks for different groups of genomes. MCScanX: a toolkit for detection and evolutionary analysis of gene synteny and collinearity. MCScan is an algorithm able to scan multiple genomes or subgenomes in order to identify putative homologous chromosomal regions, and align these regions using genes as anchors. The MCScanX toolkit implements an adjusted MCScan algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for visualization of results and additional downstream analyses.

Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. They include agents that act against TNFα (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL-1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), IL-17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab) and IL12/23 (ustekinumab). The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought to play a major role in RP.

602918381cb411341a00010c	Which tools have been developed for identifying and visualising ncRNA promoters?	EPD in 2020: enhanced data visualization and extension to ncRNA promoters. The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD), available online at https://epd.epfl.ch, provides accurate transcription start site (TSS) information for promoters of 15 model organisms plus corresponding functional genomics data that can be viewed in a genome browser, queried or analyzed via web interfaces, or exported in standard formats (FASTA, BED, CSV) for subsequent analysis with other tools. Recent work has focused on the improvement of the EPD promoter viewers, which use the UCSC Genome Browser as visualization platform. Thousands of high-resolution tracks for CAGE, ChIP-seq and similar data have been generated and organized into public track hubs. Customized, reproducible promoter views, combining EPD-supplied tracks with native UCSC Genome Browser tracks, can be accessed from the organism summary pages or from individual promoter entries. Moreover, thanks to recent improvements and stabilization of ncRNA gene catalogs, we were able to release promoter collections for certain classes of ncRNAs from human and mouse. Furthermore, we developed automatic computational protocols to assign orphan TSS peaks to downstream genes based on paired-end (RAMPAGE) TSS mapping data, which enabled us to add nearly 9000 new entries to the human promoter collection. ncPro-ML: An integrated computational tool for identifying non-coding RNA promoters in multiple species. The promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates transcription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes were used to convert DNA sequences into feature vectors.

604b6a941cb411341a00016f	What is the active ingredient in the most common hand sanitizer?	Alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) are the primary method of hand hygiene in health-care settings. ICPs increasingly are assessing ABHR product efficacy data as improved products and test methods are developed.  Two ABHRs (70% ethanol) were tested according to 3 in vivo methods   While both alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) or washing with soap and water are claimed to have been effective, hand sanitizers have gained more popularity due to the ease of use.  The adverse effects of alcohol in these sanitizers can be manifold. An allergic or inflammatory response can occur depending on the predisposing or preexisting conditions.  This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0.12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer benzalkonium chloride hand sanitizer  As a result of the coronavirus disease pandemic, commercial hand hygiene products have become scarce and World Health Organization (WHO) alcohol-based hand rub formulations containing ethanol or isopropanol are being produced for hospitals worldwide.  Contrary to the originally proposed WHO hand rub formulations, both modified formulations are appropriate for surgical hand preparation after 3 minutes when alcohol concentrations of 80% wt/wt ethanol or 75% wt/wt isopropanol along with reduced glycerol concentration (0.5%) are used. BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0.12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer. It was hypothesized that the active ingredient in non-alcoholic hand sanitizers, benzalkonium chloride, is responsible for the increase in fingermark development quality observed with amino acid reagents, while the increased moisture content present on the ridges resulted in better powdered fingermarks. ) is a common preservative in ophthalmic medications and is the active ingredient in some skin disinfectants and hand sanitizers. BAK is known to be effect imary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations. Enrol ter the first week, the test subjects used the BZK hand sanitizer in place of the ethanol sanitizer. A Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands.  BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0.12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand san nsumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of m Methanol as an Unlisted Ingredient in Supposedly Alcohol-Based Hand Rub Can Pose Serious Health Risk d Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity f One of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery.Conclusion: Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. The purpose of this report was to present a case of ethanol-induced hand sanitizer intoxication after spine surgery in a patient with a postoperative delirious state.Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis. If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (≥60% ethanol or ≥70% isopropanol) (2). We investigated the charge generated on bedclothes (cotton and polyester) during bedding exchange with different humidities and the ignitability of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (72.3 mass% ethanol) due to static spark with different temperatures to identify the hazards of electrostatic shocks and ignitions occurring previously in medical facilities. We subsequently discovered the patient had consumed half of an ethanol hand sanitizer bottle (about 300-400 mL) which was placed at the foot of the bed to prevent infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a logistically reasonable option for most circumstances, mitigating the requirement for clean running water to facilitate more traditional "soap and water" methods of hand disinfection. The primary outcome was alcohol-based hand sanitizer use based on weighing bottles of hand sanitizer. Comparison between hand sanitized fingermarks and non-hand sanitized fingermarks showed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizers did not result in any visible differences in fingermark quality. BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0.12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer.METHODS: Fingertip touch culture plates were obtained from 40 HCWs in which all HCWs used antimicrobial soap containing 0.6% chloroxylenol for handwashing according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the entire study, while continuing to use the 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline We evaluated the virucidal efficacy of seven hand sanitizers containing various active ingredients, such as ethanol, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, and compared their effectiveness against feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and a GII.4 norovirus fecal extract. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a common preservative in ophthalmic medications and is the active ingredient in some skin disinfectants and hand sanitizers. The goal here was to determine whether hand sanitizers that contain ethanol or isopropanol as the active microbicide might reduce transmission of these parasites. Ethanol and isopropanol in concentrations present in hand sanitizers sharply reduce excystation of Giardia and Entamoeba and eliminate oral infectivity of Giardia cysts in gerbils.

6057a1ed94d57fd87900002f	List example genes that SWIM tool has identified and which are down-regulated in glioblastoma	It is well-known that glioblastoma contains self-renewing, stem-like subpopulation with the ability to sustain tumor growth. These cells - called cancer stem-like cells - share certain phenotypic characteristics with untransformed stem cells and are resistant to many conventional cancer therapies, which might explain the limitations in curing human malignancies. Thus, the identification of genes controlling the differentiation of these stem-like cells is becoming a successful therapeutic strategy, owing to the promise of novel targets for treating malignancies.METHODS: Recently, we developed SWIM, a software able to unveil a small pool of genes - called switch genes - critically associated with drastic changes in cell phenotype. Here, we applied SWIM to the expression profiling of glioblastoma stem-like cells and conventional glioma cell lines, in order to identify switch genes related to stem-like phenotype.RESULTS: SWIM identifies 171 switch genes that are all down-regulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells. This list encompasses genes like CAV1, COL5A1, COL6A3, FLNB, HMMR, ITGA3, ITGA5, MET, SDC1, THBS1, and VEGFC, involved in "ECM-receptor interaction" and "focal adhesion" pathways.

60607fea94d57fd87900003f	Which R packages have been developed for studying TADs?	TADCompare: An R Package for Differential and Temporal Analysis of Topologically Associated Domains. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of boundaries of interacting domains between two or more Hi-C datasets. TADCompare is based on a spectral clustering-derived measure called the eigenvector gap, which enables a loci-by-loci comparison of boundary differences. Using this measure, we introduce methods for identifying differential and consensus boundaries of interacting domains and tracking boundary changes over time. We further propose a novel framework for the systematic classification of boundary changes. Colocalization- and gene enrichment analysis of different types of boundary changes demonstrated distinct biological functionality associated with them. TADCompare is available on https://github.com/dozmorovlab/TADCompare and Bioconductor (submitted). SpectralTAD: an R package for defining a hierarchy of topologically associated domains using spectral clustering. Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .

605255a894d57fd87900000a	What genes is implicated in myotonic goats and other  nondystrophic myotonias?	We have investigated the molecular basis for decreased muscle chloride conductance in the myotonic goat, an historically important animal model for the elucidation of the role of chloride in muscle excitation. A single nucleotide change causing the substitution of proline for a conserved alanine residue in the carboxyl terminus of the goat muscle chloride channel (gCIC-1) was discovered. The nondystrophic myotonias are rare muscle hyperexcitability disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene or loss-of-function mutations in the CLCN1 gene he observed phenotype resembled congenital myotonia caused by CLCN1 mutations in goats and humans.  Nondystrophic myotonias are characterized by muscle stiffness triggered by voluntary movement. They are caused by mutations in either the CLCN1 gene in myotonia congenita or in the SCN4A gene in paramyotonia congenita and sodium channel myotonias. Thomsen's and Becker's diseases are the most prevalent nondystrophic myotonias. Their frequency varies, according to different sources, from 1 : 100 000 to 1 : 10 000. Thomsen's myotonia is autosomal dominant, and Becker's myotonia is autosomal recessive. Both diseases result from mutations of the CLCN1 gene encoding chloride ion channels of skeletal muscles. Thomsen's (TM) and Becker's (BM) Myotonias are nondystrophic myotonias. At present, 150 mutations in the CLCN1 gene, which results in the development of TM and BM, have been described.  Based on the results of a molecular-genetic analysis of CLCN1 gene in patients with nondystrophic myotonias, Mutations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias.  Mutations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias. INTRODUCTION: Mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A), which encodes Nav1.4, cause nondystrophic myotonia that occasionally is associated with severe apnea and lary ations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias. Genetic  Nondystrophic myotonias are disorders of Na+ (Nav1.4 or SCN4A) and Cl- (CLCN1) channels in skeletal muscles, and frequently show phenotype heterogeneity. Currently, four genes are identified to be involved in myotonia: the muscle voltage-gated sodium and chloride channel genes SCN4A and CLCN1, the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, and the CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein gene CNBP. Mutations in the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit gene (SCN4A) have been associated with a spectrum of inherited nondystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses. Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region in the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. Identification and Functional Characterization of CLCN1 Mutations Found in Nondystrophic Myotonia Patients. The nondystrophic myotonias are rare muscle hyperexcitability disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene or loss-of-function mutations in the CLCN1 gene. INTRODUCTION: Mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A), which encodes Nav1.4, cause nondystrophic myotonia that occasionally is associated with severe apnea and Becker syndrome, a recessive nondystrophic myotonia caused by mutations in the chloride channel 1 gene (CLCN1), is characterized by delayed muscle relaxation after contraction. Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita or Thomsen's disease and autosomal recessive myotonia congenita or Becker's are rare nondystrophic disorders due to allelic mutations of the muscle chloride channel gene, CLCN1. Therefore we analyzed genetic mutations in CLCN1 and SCN4A in 10 Chinese families clinically diagnosed with Non-dystrophic myotonias.

5fdb84f2a43ad31278000030	Which diseases are associated with the Yaa gene?	 Yaa is a Y-chromosome-linked gene that accelerates autoimmune diseases in some autoimmune-prone strains of mice Yaa mice bearing the NZB chromosome 13 locus displayed increased serum gp70 production, but not gp70 IC formation and glomerulonephritis Yaa congenic mice, each carrying one individual NZB QTL. Male (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, carrying the BXSB Yaa gene, serve as a model for SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome.  BXSB mice spontaneously develop a lupus-like syndrome that is accelerated by the Yaa gene (Y-linked autoimmune accelerator). F1 mice, a model in which the lupus-like autoimmune syndrome observed in male mice is associated with the presence of an as yet unidentified Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration gene, Yaa. The role of the Yaa gene in lupus syndrome It is intriguing that the Yaa gene effect is selective on autoimmune responses, The Y chromosome-linked "autoimmune accelerating" yaa gene suppresses collagen-induced arthritis The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating gene mutation (yaa), first discovered in the BXSB mouse strain, is known to accelerate spontaneous autoantibody production and subsequent development of lupus disease The role of the Yaa gene in lupus syndrome. The BXSB Y chromosome-linked mutant gene, Yaa, accelerates the progression of a lupus-like autoimmune syndrome only in mice that are predisposed to autoimmune diseases. The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in BXSB male mice is associated with the presence of an as yet unidentified mutant gene, Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in BXSB male mice is associated with the presence of an as yet unidentified mutant gene, Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). In vi The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating gene mutation (yaa), first discovered in the BXSB mouse strain, is known to accelerate spontaneous autoantibody production and subsequent development of lupus disease. We  ompared the clinical development (autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in these three F1 hybrids in the presence or absence of the mutant gene, Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), which normally accelerates the progression of murine SLE. (NZB x BXSB)F1 The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating (Yaa) locus drives the transition to fatal lupus nephritis when combined with B6.Sle1 in our C57BL/6J (B6)-congenic model of systemic autoimmunity. We a  are not overtly autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa C By assessing the development of Y-linked autoimmune acceleration (Yaa) gene-induced systemic lupus erythematosus in C57BL/6 (B6) x (New Zealand Black (NZB) x B6.Yaa)F(1) backcross male mice, we mapped three major susceptibility loci derived from the NZB strain. These thre By assessing the development of Y-linked autoimmune acceleration (Yaa) gene-induced systemic lupus erythematosus in C57BL/6 (B6) x (New Zealand Black (NZB) x B6.Yaa)F(1) backcross male mice, we mapped three major susceptibility loci derived from the NZB strain. Our results suggest that the Yaa gene, unlike the lpr gene, exhibits selective autoimmune accelerating activity, but as a result of increased formation of certain nephritogenic autoantibodies such as anti-gp70 antibodies, the Yaa gene is able to accelerate the progression of lupus-like nephritis in lupus-prone mice. Linkage of a major quantitative trait locus to Yaa gene-induced lupus-like nephritis in (NZW x C57BL/6)F1 mice. In the present study, we mapped the major quantitative trait loci (QTL) differing between the NZW and C57BL/6 inbred strains of mice by making use of (NZW x C57BL/6.Yaa)F1 mice, a model in which the lupus-like autoimmune syndrome observed in male mice is associated with the presence of an as yet unidentified Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration gene, Yaa. Our study thus provides a model to dissect the complex genetic interactions that result in manifestations of murine lupus-like disease. The Yaa gene abrogates the major histocompatibility complex association of murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice. These data indicate that (a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice. The accelerated development of lupus-like autoimmune disease in male BXSB mice (H-2b, I-E-) is associated to the presence of a mutant gene, designated Yaa, located on their Y chromosome. The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating gene mutation (yaa), first discovered in the BXSB mouse strain, is known to accelerate spontaneous autoantibody production and subsequent development of lupus disease. The finding that the Yaa gene-induced acceleration of lupus-like autoimmune disease is modulated by gene(s) within or closely linked to the H-2 complex underlines the crucial role of the major histocompatibility complex and the polygenetic nature of autoimmune disease in BXSB mice.

Inhibition of TWIST1 leads to activation of oncogene-induced senescence in oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer. silencing of TWIST1 in oncogene driver-dependent NSCLCs represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy. Silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either activation of a latent oncogene-induced senescence program or, in some cases, apoptosis. the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to Kras-induced senescence. Structure-function studies of the bHLH phosphorylation domain of TWIST1 in prostate cancer cells Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235 strongly attenuated TWIST1-induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. Twist1 is a key regulator of cancer-associated fibroblasts In xenograft models, tumor infiltration of Twist1-expressing CAFs was enhanced strongly by ectopic IL6 expression in gastric or breast cancer cells. Enforced expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts was also sufficient to drive CAF marker expression and malignant character in gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. TWIST1, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, is critical for oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenesis.  The Transcription Factor ETV5 Mediates BRAFV600E-Induced Proliferation and TWIST1 Expression in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Cells up-regulates Twist1 in non-small cell lung cancer cells leading to increased migration, invasion, and resistance to crizotinib Combination of Twist1 siRNA and crizotinib significantly reduced cell vitality, inhibited cell invasion and migration, and promoted apoptosis in A549-CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation cells hese results suggested that CD74-ROS1 G2032R mutation mediated EMT phenotype by increasing the expression of Twist1, resulting in drug resistance. Combination of Twist1 silence and ROS1 inhibitor may provide a potent strategy to treat the ROS1+ NSCLC patients with crizotinib resistance. Disruption of ETV6 leads to TWIST1-dependent progression and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in prostate cancer Our results implicate ETV6 as a potential marker for predicting efficacy of an EGFR-targeted anticancer approach. Combination treatment of TWIST1 inhibitors could sensitize the anti-proliferation effects of EGFR-TKIs. Long noncoding RNA PVT1 promotes EMT via mediating microRNA-186 targeting of Twist1 in prostate cancer Furthermore, PVT1 can promote EMT by up-regulation of Twist1, a transcription factor associated with EMT. We then confirmed that PVT1 acts as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 by a sponge effect. Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly, knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal phenotype and cell migration ability. we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression. TMPRSS4 Upregulates TWIST1 Expression through STAT3 Activation to Induce Prostate Cancer Cell Migration. Taken together, we demonstrated a mechanistic cascade of TMPRSS4 up-regulating STAT3 activation and subsequent TWIST1 expression, leading to prostate cancer migration Phosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness. Twist1 is expressed in breast, liver, prostate, gastric and other types of cancers, and its expression is usually associated with invasive and metastatic cancer phenotypes. Germline mutation screening of the Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes TWIST1 and FGFR3 in families with BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer. Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene. Structure-function studies of the bHLH phosphorylation domain of TWIST1 in prostate cancer cells. In humans, a germline mutation (c.309C>G) in the TWIST1 oncogene may predispose to breast cancer and its expression has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis. I Germline mutation screening of the Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes TWIST1 and FGFR3 in families with BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer  that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene. Additional studies are, Foxa1 expression is linked with luminal breast cancer (LBC) with good prognosis, whereas Twist1 expression is associated with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) with poor prognosis owing to its role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness and metastasis. Associations of gene‑wide SNPs in SNAI1 and TWIST1 with breast cancer and ovarian cancer susceptibility among Chinese Han women. These results indicate that tamoxifen can significantly accelerate Twist1 degradation to suppress cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that tamoxifen can be used not only to treat ER-positive breast cancers but also to reduce Twist1-mediated invasion and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancers. In humans, a germline mutation (c.309C>G) in the TWIST1 oncogene may predispose to breast cancer and its expression has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis. Twist1 levels were also elevated in metastatic prostate cancer-derived cell line DU145, in immortalized lung fibroblasts and in a subset of lung cancer samples, all in a mutant p53-dependent manner.

6026af5e1cb411341a0000c9	Which microRNAs are involved in targeting CYLD in triple negative breast cancer?	MicroRNA-301b promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance in triple-negative breast cancer by targeting CYLD. Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the expression and biological role of miR-301b in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear. Here we aimed to evaluate the roles and mechanisms of miR-301b in TNBC cells. miR-301b expression was assessed in TNBC specimens and cell lines by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). TNBC cells were transfected with miR-301b mimics, inhibitors or Cylindromatosis (CYLD) small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. The functional roles of miR-301b were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Western blots and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of mRNAs and proteins in the cells. We found that miR-301b was upregulated in TNBC specimens and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-301b promoted cell proliferation in TNBC cells, while inhibited the apoptosis induced by 5-FU. CYLD was downregulated by miR-301b at both mRNA and protein levels in TNBC cells. Dual-luciferase report assay confirmed that miR-301b downregulated CYLD by direct interaction with the 3'-untranslated region(3'-UTR) of CYLD mRNA. NF-κB activation was mechanistically associated with miR-301b-mediated downregulation of CYLD. However, inhibition of miR-301b reversed all the effects of miR-301b. In conclusion, miR-301b plays an oncogenic role in TNBC possibly by downregulating CYLD and subsequently activating NF-κB p65, and this may provide a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC. Overexpression of microRNA-182 (miR-182) is found in multiple cancers, but the association of miR-182 expression with the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) remains unknown. In this study, up-regulation of miR-182 was validated in TNBC patients and cell lines. Knockdown of miR-182 was observed to hinder the proliferation of BT-549 cells. More importantly, knockdown of miR-182 significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by TNF-α treatment in BT-549. JC-1 staining and western blot assays revealed that the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) were removed and the outer mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and permeability was altered upon combination of TNF-α with anti-miR-182. We then demonstrated that knockdown of miR-182 up-regulated the expression of cylindromatosis (CYLD) deubiquitinase, which promoted the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and subsequent caspase-8 activation in TNF-α-treated BT-549 cells. Collectively, the results of the present study improve our understanding of the role of miR-182 in TNBC, knockdown of which facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin chains on RIP1, leading to the caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in TNF-α-treated TNBC cells. This may be valuable for the development of cancer therapy.	[['microRNA-301b'], ['microRNA-182', 'miR-182']]

Instead operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their function Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the presence and absence of C. elegans operons in Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis brenneri, using Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi as outgroups, and identified numerous operon gains and losses In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, up to 15% of the genes are organized in operons. Here we address this issue by analysing transcription termination at the end of single protein expressing genes and genes located within operons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that birth-death models of operon evolution reasonably describe the relative abundance of operons of different sizes in the C. elegans and Ciona genomes and generate predictions about the number of monocistronic, nonoperon genes that likely participate in the birth-death process. This theory, and applications to C. elegans and Ciona, motivates several new and testable hypotheses about eukaryote operon evolution. Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis. e operon structure in the eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans genome is a valuable, though underserved, tool for identifying physically or functionally interacting proteins. Based on the  The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is unusual among eukaryotes, in that it contains operons. This is one of the largest operons identified thus far in the C. elegans genome. The frataxin-encoding operon of Caenorhabditis elegans shows complex structure and regulation. The C. elegans frataxin gene, frh-1, is encoded in the operon CEOP2232. There are instances of operons found in C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic species. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.

5fdb43f6a43ad3127800002e	What are the two types of duplicated genes in the yeast S. cerevisiae?	We find high levels of redundancy among genes duplicated both via the whole genome duplication and via smaller scale duplications.  Here, we present evidence from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome that a duplicate located in a genomic region with a low-recombination rate is likely to evolve faster than a duplicate in an area of high recombination.  On the basis of the inferred phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast lineages. gene duplications might have occurred as a single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates being more transcriptionally altered than small-scale duplicates. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates exhibiting different preservation trends compared to small-scale duplicates.  Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) have contributed to gene-repertoire enrichment in many eukaryotic lineages Our genomic analysis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that the number of shared regulatory motifs in the duplicates decreases with evolutionary time, whereas the total number of regulatory motifs remains unchanged. The genome of the budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including 457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication.  A whole-genome duplication occurred in the ancestor of Saccharomyces yeast species but 92% of duplicates returned to single-copy genes shortly after duplication. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome duplicates exhibiting different preservation trends compared to small-scale duplicates. iae genome. We partition the yeast duplicates into ohnologs (generated by a whole-genome duplication) and non-ohnologs (from small-scale duplication events) to determine whether their disparate origins commit them to divergent evolutionary trajectories and genomic attributes.RESULTS: We conclude that, for the most part, ohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar to non-ohnologs in their structural attributes (specifically the relative composition frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplicates), the discernible length of the duplicated region (duplication span) as well	[['whole-genome duplicates (WGD)'], ['small-scale duplicates (SSD)']]

5fe31322a43ad3127800004c	Which lncRNAs are induced by heatshock?	The Malat1 long non-coding RNA is upregulated by signalling through the PERK axis of unfolded protein response during flavivirus infection. Following the initial discovery of the heat shock RNA omega (hsrω) gene of Drosophila melanogaster to be non-coding (nc) and also inducible by cell stress, other stress-inducible long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been described in diverse organisms. Non-coding RNAs turn up the heat: an emerging layer of novel regulators in the mammalian heat shock response. It is our hope that much of what is discussed herein may help researchers in integrating the fields of heat shock and ncRNA in mammals. Indeed, as discussed in this review, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), the largest family of noncoding transcripts, have emerged as common regulators of many cellular stressors; including heat shock, metabolic deprivation and DNA damage.  Attenuation of pre-rRNA synthesis in response to heat stress is accompanied by upregulation of PAPAS, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is transcribed in antisense orientation to pre-rRNA Yet-to-be-explored genomics areas include miRNA, lncRNA, copy number variations, RNA sequencing, and human genome-wide association study. LncRNA and mRNA profiling during activation of tilapia macrophages by HSP70 56 lncRNA, 10173 mRNA and 1782 transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) were differentially expressed by pairwise comparison. LNC_00035 and LNC_000466 LNC_000792, LNC_000215, LNC_000035 and LNC_000310, with cis and/or trans relationships with mRNAs, were also involved in ceRNA network. The long non-coding RNA NEAT1 and nuclear paraspeckles are upregulated by the transcription factor HSF1 in the heat shock response. NEAT1 and paraspeckle formation are increased in cells upon exposure to a variety of environmental stressors, and believed to play an important role in cell survival.  We show that NEAT1 is a novel target gene of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), and upregulated when the heat shock response pathway is activated by Sulforaphane (SFN) or elevated temperature We have found that the expression of HSP70, HSP90, and HSP27 is amplified and sustained during heat shock in NEAT1-depleted cells compared to control cells, indicating that NEAT1 feeds back via an unknown mechanism to regulate HSF1 activity.

5fdb4190a43ad3127800001b	Which genes are the main markers of primitive Endoderm (prEN) formation?	This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of the pluripotency marker Nanog. Thus, Fgf4 mutant embryos initiated the PrE program but exhibited defects in its restriction phase, when lineage bias is acquired Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for specification of the primitive endoderm gf4 heterozygous blastocysts exhibited increased numbers of NANOG-positive EPI cells and reduced numbers of GATA6-positive PrE cells, suggesting that FGF signaling is tightly regulated to ensure specification of the appropriate numbers of cells for each lineage Recently, the identification of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα) as an early-expressed protein that is also a marker of the later primitive endoderm lineage Taken together, the results obtained in this study suggested that mouse ES cells expressing exogenous EGAM1 preferentially differentiate into extra-embryonic primitive endoderm lineages, rather than embryonic lineages or extra-embryonic trophectoderm lineages.  In this work, we isolated Lrp2 as a novel PrE precursor (pre-PrE) marker by using a microarray strategy that combines a transcriptome analysis of three stem cell lines and early embryos We have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfralpha) as an early-expressed protein that is also a marker of the later PrE lineage. Furthermore, the subcellular location of Lrp2, Disabled-2 (Dab2) and Collagen-IV shows that the epithelial structure is acquired in individual cells through successive steps. More specifically, overexpression of Gata6 or Foxa2 alone induced molecular and morphological markers of primitive endoderm, which occurred concomitantly with the upregulation of the Wnt6 gene. Gene knockouts in mice have showed that Grb2 and GATA6 are essential for the formation of primitive endoderm in blastocysts. Thus, the current study establishes that GATA6 is essential for the formation of primitive endoderm, at a much earlier stage then previously recognized, and expression of GATA6 discriminates parietal endoderm from visceral endoderm lineages. At embryonic day (E) 5.0, parietal endoderm cells continue to express both GATA4 and GATA6; however, visceral endoderm cells express GATA4 but exhibit a reduced expression of GATA6. By and after E5.5, visceral endoderm cells no longer express GATA6. We further analyzed the dynamic expression and mutant phenotypes of GATA6 in early mouse embryos. Cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst differentiate into the pluripotent epiblast or the primitive endoderm (PrE), marked by the transcription factors NANOG and GATA6, respectively. Moreover, we found that subsequent expression of Sox17 and Gata4--later markers of the PrE--depends on the presence of Fgf4 produced by Nanog-expressing cells. Ectopic expression of GATA6 bypasses requirement for Grb2 in primitive endoderm formation. Moreover, the expression of an epiblast marker gene, NANOG, and a primitive endoderm marker gene, GATA6, remained unchanged, whereas the expression of another primitive endoderm marker gene, HNF4A, was significantly reduced in FGFR2-KD embryos. Sox17, a marker of primitive endoderm, is not detected following prolonged culture of such embryos, but can be rescued by provision of exogenous FGF4.

She was treated with mesna, ifosfamide, Adriamycin, and dacarbazine (MAID) chemotherapy and after one cycle of chemotherapy she had no evidence of tumor.  When diagnosed with pulmonary metastasis, the patient received combined chemotherapy regimen of MAID (mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine) for 6 cycles. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT; modified mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine [MAID]), interdigitated preoperative radiation therapy (RT; 44 Gy administered in split courses), and three cycles of postoperative CT (modified MAID). We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of myxofibrosarcoma successfully treated with mesna, pirarubicin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine (modified MAID) regimen.  The authors report a case of a 57-year-old male with advanced SRCC who had a durable complete response after MAID (mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine) chemotherapy, and remains free of disease four years after completing treatment.

Repeat expansions are responsible for over 40 monogenic disorders, and undoubtedly more pathogenic repeat expansions remain to be discovered. Existing methods for detecting repeat expansions in short-read sequencing data require predefined repeat catalogs. Recent discoveries emphasize the need for methods that do not require pre-specified candidate repeats. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide repeat expansion detection. Analysis of real and simulated data shows that our method can identify large expansions of 41 out of 44 pathogenic repeats, including nine recently reported non-reference repeat expansions not discoverable via existing methods. ExpansionHunter: a sequence-graph-based tool to analyze variation in short tandem repeat regions. We describe a novel computational method for genotyping repeats using sequence graphs. This method addresses the long-standing need to accurately genotype medically important loci containing repeats adjacent to other variants or imperfect DNA repeats such as polyalanine repeats. Here we introduce a new version of our repeat genotyping software, ExpansionHunter, that uses this method to perform targeted genotyping of a broad class of such loci.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ExpansionHunter is implemented in C++ and is available under the Apache License Version 2.0. The source code, documentation, and Linux/macOS binaries are available at https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter/.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

6027fec01cb411341a0000f0	What is caused by BACH2-related immunodeficiency?	The transcriptional programs that guide lymphocyte differentiation depend on the precise expression and timing of transcription factors (TFs). The TF BACH2 is essential for T and B lymphocytes and is associated with an archetypal super-enhancer (SE). Single-nucleotide variants in the BACH2 locus are associated with several autoimmune diseases, but BACH2 mutations that cause Mendelian monogenic primary immunodeficiency have not previously been identified. Here we describe a syndrome of BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA) that results from BACH2 haploinsufficiency. Affected subjects had lymphocyte-maturation defects that caused immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. The mutations disrupted protein stability by interfering with homodimerization or by causing aggregation. We observed analogous lymphocyte defects in Bach2-heterozygous mice. More generally, we observed that genes that cause monogenic haploinsufficient diseases were substantially enriched for TFs and SE architecture. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SE architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in SE-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized.

Somatic mosaicism and common genetic variation contribute to the risk of very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a heterogeneous phenotype associated with a spectrum of rare Mendelian disorders. Here, we perform whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis of 3.5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected. In five patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1). We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB. The mutation is present in ~70% of phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening infections. Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls; P < 4 × 10-10), and replicate this finding in an independent cohort of VEO-IBD cases and controls (117 patients and 2,603 controls; P < 5 × 10-10). This discovery indicates that a polygenic component operates in VEO-IBD pathogenesis. Variants in TRIM22 That Affect NOD2 Signaling Are Associated With Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

5ea97bec0d431b5f73000007	Which methods infer 3D genome structure without proximity ligation?	 Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC and ChIA-Pet) are increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype. We now report transposase-mediated analysis of chromatin looping (Trac-looping) for simultaneous detection of multiscale genome-wide chromatin interactions among regulatory elements and chromatin accessibility.  By combining 3C and high-throughput sequencing, the Hi-C method reveals genome-wide interactions within topological domains and global genome structure as a whole.  Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. We describe a genome architecture assay, tethered multiple 3C (TM3C), that maps genome-wide chromatin contacts via a simple protocol of restriction enzyme digestion and religation of fragments upon agarose gel beads followed by paired-end sequencing.  Here we report a genome-wide method, genome architecture mapping (GAM), for measuring chromatin contacts and other features of three-dimensional chromatin topology on the basis of sequencing DNA from a large collection of thin nuclear sections.  Improvements to these methods and the recent development of ligation-free approaches, including GAM, SPRITE and ChIA-Drop, are now helping to uncover new aspects of 3D genome topology that confirm the nucleus to be a complex, highly organized organelle. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles.

Pathogenic variants in Lysyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (KARS1) have increasingly been recognized as a cause of early-onset complex neurological phenotypes. To advance the timely diagnosis of KARS1-related disorders, we sought to delineate its phenotype and generate a disease model to understand its function in vivo.METHODS: Through international collaboration, we identified 22 affected individuals from 16 unrelated families harboring biallelic likely pathogenic or pathogenic in KARS1 variants. Sequencing approaches ranged from disease-specific panels to genome sequencing. We generated loss-of-function alleles in zebrafish.RESULTS: We identify ten new and four known biallelic missense variants in KARS1 presenting with a moderate-to-severe developmental delay, progressive neurological and neurosensory abnormalities, and variable white matter involvement. We describe novel KARS1-associated signs such as autism, hyperactive behavior, pontine hypoplasia, and cerebellar atrophy with prevalent vermian involvement. Loss of kars1 leads to upregulation of p53, tissue-specific apoptosis, and downregulation of neurodevelopmental related genes, recapitulating key tissue-specific disease phenotypes of patients.

Reports on the antischistosomal effect of several antimalarial drugs such as artesunate, mefloquine, and amodiaquine suggest that febrifugine, which exerts an antimalarial effect, can also be expected to possess antischistosomal potential. Febrifugine exerts potent antischistosomal effects and can be expected to contribute to the development of a novel antischistosomal drug. Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family that drives protein translation in cells. The apicomplexan PRSs are validated targets of febrifugine (FF) and its halogenated derivative halofuginone (HF). PRSs are of great interest for drug development against Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii.  Two best ligands (FFG7 and FFG2) qualifying above screening parameters were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation. Conducting these studies, here we confirmed that 6-chloro-3-[3-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidyl)-2-oxo-propyl]-7-(4-pyridyl) quinazolin-4-one can be potential drug candidate to fight against Leishmania donovani parasites.

6278e49256bf9aee6f000017	For what known mutations is KRAS gene considered to be oncogenic?	Mutations in KRAS - such as the G12C mutation - are found in most pancreatic, half of colorectal and a third of lung cancer cases and is thus responsible for a substantial proportion of cancer deaths KRAS G12V mutation upregulates PD-L1 expression via TGF-β/EMT signaling pathway in human non-small-cell lung cancer. The most prevalent mutant subtype of KRAS in lung adenocarcinoma was G12C(9.88 %,56/567), followed by G12 V(5.82 %,33/567), G12D(3.00 %,17/567), G12A(3.00 %,17/567), respectively. Over 80% of oncogenic KRAS mutations occur at codon 12, where the glycine residue is substituted by different amino acids, leading to genomic heterogeneity of KRas-mutant tumors. KRAS codon 146 mutations, as well as the previously reported OES-associated alterations, are known oncogenic KRAS mutations with distinct functional consequences. Because oncogenic mutations occur in exons 2 or 3, two constitutively active KRAS proteins-each capable of transforming cells-are encoded when KRAS is activated by mutation2.  KRAS mutational status was determined in the purified DNA samples by Real Time (RT)-PCR using primers specific for the detection of wild-type KRAS or the following seven oncogenic somatic mutations: Gly12Ala, Gly12Asp, Gly12Arg, Gly12Cys, Gly12Ser, Gly12Val and Gly13As The majority of mutations are found at KRAS codons 12 and 13, and they appear to be more frequent in smokers and adenocarcinoma To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 66 anal, vulvar, and head and neck SCC with known immunohistochemical p16(INK4a) and HPV DNA status for KRAS mutations in exon 2 (codons 12, 13, and 15) 6%) KRAS mutations in exon 1 (nine in codon 12 and one in codon 13), two missense mutations of BRAF (6%), one within exon 11 (G469A), and one V600E hot spot mutation in exon 15 of BRAF 21); (3) KRAS(G12) and KRAS(G13) mutations are correlated, respectively, with the left and right colon cancer development (P<0. The dominant oncogenic mutations of KRAS are single amino acid substitutions at codon 12, in particular G12D and G12V present in 60% to 70% of pancreatic cancers and 20% to 30% of colorectal cancers. CK) 5/6 and/or EGFR. KRAS mutational status was determined in the purified DNA samples by Real Time (RT)-PCR using primers specific for the detection of wild-type KRAS or the following seven oncogenic somatic mutations: Gly12Ala, Gly12Asp, Gly12Arg, Gly12Cys, Gly12Ser, Gly12Val and Gly13Asp.RESULTS: We found no evidence of KRAS oncogenic mutations in all analyzed tumors.CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that KRAS mutations are very infrequent in triple-negative breast tumors and that EGFR inhibitors may be of potential benefit in the treatment of basal-like breast tumors, which  Similarly, the most frequent KRAS oncogenic mutation G12D also drives K-RAS4B toward an exposed configuration. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations. In addition to testing for known actionable oncogenic driver alterations in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, and NTRK and for the expression of programmed cell-death protein ligand 1, pathologists, medical oncologists, and community practitioners will need to incorporate routine testing for emerging biomarkers such as MET amplification, ERBB2 (alias HER2), and KRAS mutations, particularly KRAS G12C, considering the promising development of direct inhibitors of KRasG12C protein. The KRAS glycine-to-cysteine mutation (G12C) composes approximately 44% of KRAS mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, with mutant KRasG12C present in approximately 13% of all patients with lung adenocarcinoma. 1 is mechanistically distinct from covalent KRASG12C inhibitors because it binds to a different pocket present in both the active and inactive forms of KRAS Pancreatic cancer is almost invariably associated with mutations in the KRAS gene, most commonly KRASG12D, that result in a dominant-active form of the KRAS GTPase. Additionally, we show that KRASG13D/+ and KRASG13D/- cells have a distinct metabolic profile characterized by dysregulation of TCA cycle, up-regulation of glycolysis and glutathione metabolism pathway as well as increased glutamine uptake and acetate utilization. Selective targeting of the oncogenic KRAS G12S mutant allele by CRISPR/Cas9 induces efficient tumor regression. The most prevalent mutations among patients with PC are c.1621A>C (rs3822214) in KIT, c.38G>C (rs112445441) in KRAS and c.733G>A (rs28934575) in TP53 genes. KRAS codon 12 mutations in Australian non-small cell lung cancer. G12V and G12C mutations in the gene KRAS are associated with a poorer prognosis in primary colorectal cancer. In lung cancers, the mutations concentrate at codon 12 and mostly affect adenocarcinomas (ADCs). KRASG12C represents only 11% of all KRAS mutations. Most of the mutations were identified in codon 12 in 16 patients (61.5% of all mutations). We identified a novel mutation c.51 G>A in codon 17, where serine was substituted by arginine (S17R) in four patients. We also identified a very rare mutation, c.91 G>A, in which glutamic acid was replaced by lysine (E31K) in three patients. Similar to the canonical mutants KRAS G12D and KRAS G13D, NIH3T3 cells overexpressing KRAS E31D and KRAS E63K showed altered morphology and were characteristically smaller, rounder, and highly refractile compared with their non-transformed counterparts. This system allowed us to rapidly compare the ability of 12 different KRAS mutations (G12A, G12C, G12D, G12F, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13C, G13D, Q61L, Q61R and A146T) to drive pancreatic tumorigenesis in vivo dinucleotide KRAS2 mutations G12F and GG12-13VC. New targeted therapies show preclinical promise in inhibiting the KRAS G12C variant. NSCLC cell lines with mutant KRas-Gly12Asp had activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) signaling, whereas those with mutant KRas-Gly12Cys or mutant KRas-Gly12Val had activated Ral signaling and decreased growth factor-dependent Akt activation. Mutations were detected in 12 tumor samples: five patients with Gly12Val (GGT>GTT), three with Gly12Asp (GGT>GAT), two patients with Gly13Asp (GGC>GAC), one patient with Gly12Ser (GGT>AGT) and one with Gly12Cys (GGT>TGT) mutation in tumor. The G12D mutation was the most commonly encountered subtype in our cohort (21/50), whereas the G12C mutation was observed in 5 cases, and interestingly, this mutation was only seen in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).

CONTEXT: The effect of sotagliflozin (a dual sodium-glucose cotransporter [SGLT] 2 and SGLT1 inhibitor) on intestinal glucose absorption has not been investigated in humans. The potential of this method is showcased by the preparation and diversification of sotagliflozin, leading to the discovery of a promising SGLT2 inhibitor candidate. Compared with metformin at Week 24 to 26, the SGLT inhibitors dapagliflozin (5 mg), sotagliflozin (200 mg) and empagliflozin (10 mg) had larger reductions in HbA1c (mean difference [MD] = -0.24, 95% credible interval [CrI], -0.41 to -0.07, MD = -0.23, 95% CrI, -0.39 to -0.08 and MD = -0.35, 95% CrI, -0.51 to -0.19, respectively) and in weight, which were sustained in sensitivity analyses.  Global trials have been conducted with liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and sotagliflozin, an inhibitor of both SGLT1 and SGLT2 transporters. Several SGLT2 inhibitors and their derivatives such as remogliflozin etabonate (phase-II), sotagliflozin (phase-III) and bexagliflozin (phase-III) are under different phases of clinical trial studies and some have been patented.  Sotagliflozin, a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporters 1 and 2, has been recently approved for use in patients with T1DM. Dapagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor) and sotagliflozin (SGLT1/2 inhibitor) are two of the drugs of SGLT inhibitor class which have been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in people with type 1 diabetes with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 .  Several clinical trials have shown that sotagliflozin (SGLT1-1/2 inhibitor) decreases body weight and reduces blood pressure in adults with T2D. ite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies. Whi Sotagliflozin appeared more promising for SGLT2 as well as AChE-inhibition with reference to ΔG and Ki values in comparison to Ertugliflozin. Sotagliflozin is an oral potent dual inhibitor of the insulin-independent SGLT1 and SGLT2. EAS COVERED: Herein, the authors focus specifically on sotagliflozin (LX4211), the first-in-class dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. O Therefore, sotagliflozin (LX4211) has been developed as a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2. Sotagliflozin (Zynquista™) is a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT) 1 and 2 being developed by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi as a treatment for type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Contemporary intravenous iron formulations allow administration of high doses of elemental iron and enable correction of total iron deficit in one or two infusions. An important but underappreciated complication of certain formulations is hypophosphatemia caused by increased secretion of the phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Persistent hypophosphatemia can occur with iron therapy and can cause debilitating diseases including myopathy, osteomalacia and fractures.  review summarizes the current understanding of the iron-phosphate axis as well as complications of intravenous iron-induced hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia Is Common After Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose Infusion Among Patients With Symptomatic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction. Administration of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for iron-deficient patients suffering heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been associated with transient hypophosphatemia. Biochemically relevant hypophosphatemia is common following a single dose of intravenous FCM. The purpose of this single-center retrospective study was to determine the incidence of decreased blood phosphorus levels and hypophosphatemia among multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with elotuzumab.  requent occurrence of hypophosphatemia among multiple myeloma patients treated with elotuzumab: a single clinic retrospective study. This retrospective study suggests that hypophosphatemia commonly occurs among MM patients receiving elotuzumab-containing therapies The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were contact dermatitis, rash, and viral upper respiratory tract infection (each n = 3, 23.1%). Five grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were reported in four patients: autoimmune colitis, dehydration, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and muscular weakness. The most common non-hematologic grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenic fever and hypophosphatemia. There were no treatment-related deaths. In conclusion, BOCE is a safe and effective outpatient salvage regimen for patients with RR NHL and serves as an effective bridge to stem cell transplantation. orty-five patients were enrolled and 41 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The most common adverse events (AEs) were mucositis, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3/4 AEs were hypophosphatemia and anemia.  Six dose-limiting toxicities were reported (mostly hematological); maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat (primary endpoint) was 10 mg. Most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (60%) and peripheral neuropathy (60%); all grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 80% of patients and included decreased neutrophil (45%), platelet (25%) and white blood cell (25%) counts, anemia (25%) and hypophosphatemia (25%).  As treatment with imatinib could not be interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate intake. Other drugs such as immunomodulators or methotrexate have been also associated with hyponatremia. Alkylating agents have been linked with the occurrence of hyponatremia [due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)] and Fanconi's syndrome (hypophosphatemia, aminoaciduria, hypouricemia and/or glucosuria). catecholamines, beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development of hypophosphatemia. Provision Hypophosphatemia, defined as serum phosphate levels below 2.5 mg/dL (0.81 mmol/L), is frequently observed in the course of treatment with commonly used drugs, such as diuretics, bisphosphonates, antibiotics, insulin, and antacids. Imatinib mesylate induces hypophosphatemia in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in late chronic phase, and this effect is associated with response. ypophosphatemia was significantly higher among COPD patients taking one or more drugs commonly used in COPD and known as negatively influencing renal phosphate handling: xanthine derivatives, corticosteroids, loop diuretics, and beta 2-adrenergic bronchodilators.

6278dc0c56bf9aee6f000010	Which biomarkers are currently used for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?	MRI measurements can be used as biomarkers of disease severity in ambulant patients with DMD. malate dehydrogenase 2 as candidate prognostic biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy Aim: Evaluate the utility of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and cardiac troponin I as safety biomarkers, and creatine kinase and muscle injury panel as muscle health biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrop Myostatin Is a Quantifiable Biomarker for Monitoring Pharmaco-gene Therapy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers of the inherited muscle wasting condition Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as they allow non-invasive monitoring of either disease progression or response to therapy. I Troponin I Levels Correlate with Cardiac MR LGE and Native T1 Values in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Cardiomyopathy and Identify Early Disease Progression OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) currently depends on non-specific measures such as Creatine kinase (CK) Serum Osteopontin as a Novel Biomarker for Muscle Regeneration in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Aim: Evaluate the utility of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and cardiac troponin I as safety biomarkers, and creatine kinase and muscle injury panel as muscle health biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy Results for five leading candidate protein biomarkers (Pgam1, Tnni3, Camk2b, Cycs and Adamts5) were validated by ELISA in the mouse samples s observed. Therefore, three microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206, were previously reported as alternative biomarkers for duchenne muscular dyst Conclusion: Results support the use of GLDH as a specific biomarker for liver injury in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Creatine kinase (CK) is generally used as a blood-based biomarker for muscular disease including DMD, but it is not always reliable since it is easily affected by stress to the body, such as exercise. , albumin Cys34 undergoes thiol oxidation and these changes correlate with levels of protein thiol oxidation and damage of the dystrophic muscles. A We show that plasma albumin oxidation reflects muscle dystropathology, as increased after exercise and decreased after taurine treatment of mdx mice. These data support the use of albumin thiol oxidation as a blood biomarker of dystropathology to assist with advancing clinical development of therapies for DMD. Among a selected set of potential biomarkers for cardiomyopathy (MMP9, BNP, GAL3, CRP, LEP, TNC, TLR4 and ST2) we validated ST2 as significantly elevated in the serum of DMD cardiomyopathy group (35,798 ± 4884 pg/mL) compared to normal controls (9940 ± 2680 pg/mL; p < 0.01; n = 6). Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) levels were found significantly increased in both DMD groups compared to controls (p < 0.01). Increased ST2 levels were found in serum of DMD subjects compared to healthy volunteers and further elevated in DMD subjects with cardiomyopathy. Interleukin 1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein (ST2) is a Potential Biomarker for Cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.  Extracellular dystrophy-associated miRNAs (dystromiRs) show dynamic patterns of expression that mirror the progression of muscle pathology in mdx mice.  xpression of the myogenic miRNA, miR-206 and the myogenic transcription factor myogenin in the tibialis anterior muscle were found to positively correlate with serum dystromiR levels, suggesting that extracellular miRNAs are indicators of the regenerative status of the musculature. Our data revealed that miR-499 was significantly upregulated in all DMD patients, and true carriers (mothers), while 78 % of potential carriers (sisters) exhibited high levels of this miRNA. Similarly, miR-103a-3p showed an increase in the patients' families although to a lesser extent. On the other hand, miR-206 and miR-191-5p were significantly downregulated in the majority of the DMD patients and the tested female family members. MicroRNA miR-103a-5p and miR-208a followed a comparable trend in patients and mothers. OPN is a promising biomarker for muscle regeneration in dystrophic dogs and can be applicable to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The serum OPN level was significantly correlated with the phenotypic severity of dystrophic dogs at the period corresponding to the onset of muscle weakness, whereas other serum markers including creatine kinase were not. Immunohistologically, OPN was up-regulated in infiltrating macrophages and developmental myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating muscle fibers in the dystrophic dogs, whereas serum OPN was highly elevated. OPN expression was also observed during the synergic muscle regeneration process induced by cardiotoxin injection. There were very good inverse correlations between the levels of these miRNAs, especially miR-206, and functional performances: high levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life. Moreover, by receiver operating characteristic curves analyses, we revealed that these miRNAs, especially miR-206, were able to discriminate DMD from controls. miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs in serum are useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and hence as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease.  miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs are useful as non-invasive biomarkers for DMD. Furthermore, ADAMTS5 was found to be significantly elevated in human DMD patient serum.  Emerging MRI biomarkers of myocardial function and structure include the estimation of rotational mechanics and regional strain using MRI tagging; T1-mapping; and T2-mapping, a marker of inflammation, edema and fat.  Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|ρ| = 0.68-0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|ρ| = 0.63-0.73) and peroneals (|ρ| = 0.59-0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function. Our results show that the serum levels of miR-30c and miR-181a increased 7- and 6-fold respectively in DMD patients (n = 21, 2-14 years, ambulant), and 7-fold in BMD patients (n = 5, 9-15 years) compared to controls (n = 22, 2-14 years). However, there was a trend towards higher levels of miR-30c in DMD patients with better preserved motor function according to various motor scales and timed tests.  We propose miR-30c and miR-181a as reliable serum diagnostic biomarkers for DMD and BMD and miR-30c as a potential novel biomarker to assess disease severity in DMD. highlights novel mdx biomarkers (GITR, MYBPC1, HSP60, SIRT2, SMAD3, CNTN1). Furthermore, the five TFs ZNF362, ATAT1, SPI1, TCF12 and ABCF2, as well as the eight miRNAs miR-124a, miR-200b/200c/429, miR-19a/b, miR-23a/b, miR-182, miR-144, miR-498 and miR-18a/b were identified as playing crucial roles in the molecular pathogenesis of DMD. erein we examined the potential applicability of serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, myostatin (GDF-8) and follistatin (FSTN) as non-invasive biomarkers to distinguish between DMD steroid naïve patients and healthy controls of similar age and also for carrier detection. Our data suggest that serum levels of MMP-9, GDF-8 and FSTN are useful to discriminate DMD from controls (p < 0.05), to correlate with some neuromuscular assessments for DMD, and also to differentiate between Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) patients. carbonic anhydrase 3, microtubule associated protein 4 and collagen type I alpha 1 chain decline rather constantly over time, myosin light chain 3, electron transfer flavoprotein A, troponin T, malate dehydrogenase 2, lactate dehydrogenase B and nestin plateaus in early teens.

61f6055b882a024a10000021	Which receptors are targeted by Tirzepatide?	The dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide improves cardiovascular risk biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes: A post hoc analysis. In a phase 2 trial of once-weekly tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, or 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), or placebo, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide dose-dependently reduced HbA1c and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide, a glucose-insulin peptide and GLP-1 dual agonist is in phase 3 study for obesity management, and bimagrumab is a new agent in phase 2 with a unique mechanism of action; they are generating much interest.  Effects of Tirzepatide, a Dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, on Lipid and Metabolite Profiles in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes. The dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide: a novel cardiometabolic therapeutic prospect. In this framework, the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide seems to be not just a new antidiabetic medication.  Tirzepatide and additional dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists that could eventually be developed in the future seem to be a promising furthest advance for the management of several cardiometabolic settings.  The Role of Tirzepatide, Dual GIP and GLP-1 Receptor Agonist, in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes: The SURPASS Clinical Trials. Tirzepatide is a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. Dual GIP and GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Tirzepatide Improves Beta-cell Function and Insulin Sensitivity in Type 2 Diabetes. CONTEXT: Novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide demonstrated substantially greater glucose control and weight loss (WL) compared with selective GLP-1RA dulaglutide. However, the mechanism by which tirzepatide improves efficacy and how GIP receptor (GIPR) agonism contributes is not fully understood. Tirzepatide is an imbalanced and biased dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. The novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying similarly to selective long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. Tirzepatide (LY3298176) is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: Is the future bright? The effect of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide on gastric emptying (GE) was compared to that of GLP-1RAs in non-clinical and clinical studies. Three approaches may be considered to potentiate weight loss: an increase of the drug dosage because of the demonstration of a dose-response, an add-on therapy with a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor as this agent exerts a complementary action through urinary calorie loss (glucosuria) or a combination of the effects of two incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP), as the potent dual agonist tirzepatide currently in development. Early phase trials in T2DM indicate that tirzepatide improves clinical outcomes beyond those achieved by a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide is a novel once-a-week dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, currently under trial to assess glycemic efficacy and safety in people with type 2 diabetes. BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type  k, the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide seems to be not just a new antidiabetic medication. Administered as OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, on biomarkers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes melli Pharmacologically, signaling studies demonstrate that tirzepatide mimics the actions of native GIP at the GIP receptor but shows bias at the GLP-1 receptor to favor cAMP generation over β-arrestin recruitment, coincident with a weaker ability to drive GLP-1 receptor internalization compared with GLP-1. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pharmacokinetics (PK) and single-dose tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist being developed for once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), weight management, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, was evaluated in subjects with renal impairment versus healthy subjects with n nts with T2D.AREAS COVERED: Tirzepatide is an unimolecular dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA in developme OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of tirzepatide, a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, on biomarkers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Tirzepatide (LY3298176), a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, delivered superior glycemic control and weight loss compared with GLP-1R agonism in patients with type 2 diabetes. BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type In this framework, the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide seems to be not just a new antidiabetic medication. This analysis reveals a greater degree of engagement of tirzepatide for the GIP receptor than the GLP-1 receptor, corroborating an imbalanced mechanism of action. BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type Experiments in primary islets reveal β-arrestin1 limits the insulin response to GLP-1, but not GIP or tirzepatide, suggesting that the biased agonism of tirzepatide enhances insulin secretion.

621ecc3e3a8413c653000060	What is a potential alternate uses(repositioning) for Primaquine	Primaquine Diphosphate, a Known Antimalarial Drug, Blocks Vascular Leakage Acting Through Junction Stabilization.  PD could be used as a novel drug for vascular leakage by maintaining endothelial integrity Here, we report that antimalaria drug primaquine phosphate (PRQ) exhibits an anti-leukemia effect on both ATRA-sensitive cell line NB4 and ATRA-resistant APL cell lines, NB4-LR2, NB4-LR1, and NB4-MR2. Primaquine phosphate induces the apoptosis of ATRA-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cells by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Here, using drug repositioning, we discovered that primaquine diphosphate (PD), previously known as an antimalarial drug, was a potential blocker of vascular leakage. We showed that primaquine, a malaria drug, inhibits the growth, migration, and colony formation of breast cancer cells in vitro, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, primaquine and chloroquine induce the apoptosis of breast cancer cells through c-Myc/Bcl-2 downregulation, induce early endosome damage and reduce nEGFR levels, and induce apoptosis in breast cancer through nEGFR/Stat3-dependent c-Myc downregulation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of chloroquine- and primaquine-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that PD could be used as a novel drug for vascular leakage by maintaining endothelial integrity.

6235ee453a8413c6530000ac	What are the main clinical components of the brain death exam?	A total of 157 ancillary tests were performed, including electroencephalogram (62%), computed tomography angiography (22%), transcranial Doppler ultrasound (6%), cerebral blood flow nuclear study (5%), cerebral angiography (4%), and other (1%). Forty-seven patients (53% of patients with AT) with confirmatory AT still underwent additional ancillary for BD confirmation  Only 21 patients (12% of all patients) were declared brain-dead using confirmatory ATs alone without ancillary testing. Our study highlights the variability in practice in regard to the AT and supports the use of ancillary tests to determine BD in patients Details provided on the performance and interpretation of ancillary tests for determination of BD/DNC were variably provided and inconsistent. Approximately half of all protocols that included each ancillary test provided details about study performance: 63% of protocols that included conventional cerebral angiography, 55% of protocols that included electroencephalography, 50% of protocols that included somatosensory evoked potentials, 48% of protocols that included transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, 43% of protocols that included nuclear medicine flow study and 41% of protocols that included brainstem auditory evoked potentials.  Diagnostic requirements for ancillary testing in BD/DNC determination vary around the world.  Apnea is one of the three cardinal findings in brain death (BD). Apnea testing (AT) is physiologically and practically complex.

61f97372882a024a10000051	List clinical phenotypes and molecular genetic features of patients with KMT2B-related disorders	We describe a cohort of 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke Fahn Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002 and P = 0.012). At 1 year post-deep brain stimulation, >50% of subjects showed BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D improvements of >30%. In the long-term deep brain stimulation cohort (deep brain stimulation inserted for >5 years, n = 8), improvement of >30% was maintained in 5/8 and 3/8 subjects for the BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D, respectively. The greatest BFMDRS-M improvements were observed for trunk (53.2%) and cervical (50.5%) dystonia, with less clinical impact on laryngeal dystonia. Improvements in gait dystonia decreased from 20.9% at 1 year to 16.2% at last assessment; no patient maintained a fully independent gait. Reduction of BFMDRS-D was maintained for swallowing (52.9%). Five patients developed mild parkinsonism following deep brain stimulation. KMT2B-related disease comprises an expanding continuum from infancy to adulthood, with early evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations. Except for laryngeal dysphonia, deep brain stimulation provides a significant improvement in quality of life and function with sustained clinical benefit depending on symptoms distribution.

6275199fe764a5320400004d	Which small molecules inhibit the c-Myc/Max dimerization?	We have identified two small molecules, dubbed Mycro1 and Mycro2, which inhibit the protein-protein interactions between the bHLHZip proteins c-Myc and Max. Mycros are the first inhibitors of c-Myc/Max dimerization, which have been demonstrated to inhibit DNA binding of c-Myc with preference over other dimeric transcription factors in vitro We tested the efficacy of Mycro3, a small-molecule inhibitor of Myc-Max dimerization Inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization by a small-molecule antagonist (IIA6B17) has been shown to interfere with MYC-induced transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that the functional inhibitors of the MYC family of oncoproteins have potential as therapeutic agents. We report here that the naturally-occurring triterpenoid celastrol is an inhibitor of the c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein, which is over-expressed in many human cancers. Most Myc inhibitors prevent the association between Myc and its obligate heterodimerization partner Max via their respective bHLH-ZIP domains One approach to its inhibition has been to disrupt the dimeric complex formed between its basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain and a similar domain on its dimerization partner, Max. As monomers, bHLHZip proteins are intrinsically disordered (ID). Previously we showed that two c-Myc-Max inhibitors, 10058-F4 and 10074-G5, bound to distinct ID regions of the monomeric c-Myc bHLHZip domain We have previously demonstrated that the small molecule 10058-F4, known to bind to the c-MYC bHLHZip dimerization domain and inhibiting the c-MYC/MAX interaction, also interferes with the MYCN/MAX dimerization in vitro and imparts anti-tumorigenic effects in neuroblastoma tumor models with MYCN overexpression We have recently reported a structure-activity relationship study of one such small molecule, 10074-G5, and generated an analog, JY-3-094, with significantly improved ability to prevent or disrupt the association between recombinant Myc and Max proteins.  In a fluorescence polarization screen for the MYC-MAX interaction, we have identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor of MYC, KJ-Pyr-9, from a Kröhnke pyridine library We developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression. The compounds enhance MYC phosphorylation on threonine-58, consequently increasing proteasome-mediated MYC degradation. The initial lead, MYC inhibitor 361 (MYCi361), suppressed in vivo tumor growth in mice, increased tumor immune cell infiltration, upregulated PD-L1 on tumors, and sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. However, 361 demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index. An improved analog, MYCi975 showed better tolerability. is.

CONCLUSIONS: Pegcetacoplan was superior to eculizumab in improving hemoglobin and clinical and hematologic outcomes in patients with PNH by providing broad hemolysis control, including control of intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.  Complement C3 Inhibitor Pegcetacoplan for Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Randomized Phase 2 Trial. CONCLUSIONS: Local C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan resulted in statistically significant reductions in the growth of GA compared with sham treatment. Pegcetacoplan is the first C3-targeted paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) therapy to be approved (in May 2021) in the USA, where it is indicated for the treatment of adults with PNH, including those switching from C5 inhibitor therapy with eculizumab and ravulizumab. ONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that among patients previously treated with eculizumab, clinical, hematological, and quality of life endpoints were better for patients who received the C3 complement inhibitor pegcetacoplan vs. patients who received ravulizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor. Pegcetacoplan (APL-2), a PEGylated C3 inhibitor, has the potential to provide more complete hemolysis control in patients with PNH. OBJECTIVE: In the absence of a head-to-head study, we assessed the comparative effectiveness of pegcetacoplan, a targeted C3 complement inhibitor, vs. ravulizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor, among patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) previously treated with eculizumab using matching-adjusted indirect comparison methodology. Beyond PNH, complement inhibition has also shown efficacy and safety in cold agglutinin disease (CAD), primarily with the C1s inhibitor of the classical complement pathway, sutimlimab, but also with pegcetacoplan.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and aggressive syndrome of excessive cytokine requiring prompt recognition and aggressive therapy. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and life-threatening condition that is characterized by an overactive response of the immune system with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines. Initial presentation of this condition often mimics and overlaps with many diseases including infections, sepsis, and multiorgan failure syndrome, which makes diagnosis the diagnosis of HLH challenging Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an acute and rapidly progressive systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by cytopenia, excessive cytokine production, and hyperferritinemia. Hemophagocytic syndrome (HS) is a severe hyper inflammatory condition whose cardinal symptoms are prolonged fever, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis by activated, morphologically benign macrophages.  Acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis comprises a heterogenous group of hyperinflammatory immunoreactions often resulting in uncontrolled immune responses, mainly throughout proliferation of cytotoxic T cells and hemophagocytosis by macrophages.  and symptoms fulfilled the five criteria for a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including fever, cytopenia, hemophagocytosis, hyperferritinemia, and high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels.

62784f9756bf9aee6f00000a	Which vitamin deficiencies may present with neurologic signs or symptoms?	There have been a few reported cases of subacute combined degeneration (SCD) associated with vitamin E deficiency, but the period of intestinal malabsorption was more than several years. This case suggests that if neurological symptoms occur in patients with intestinal obstruction, clinicians need to consider a deficiency of micronutrients such as vitamin E and vitamin B12. SCD associated with vitamin E deficiency was confirmed by laboratory investigations, electrophysiologic test, and whole spine magnetic resonance imaging scans. Vision loss resulting from thiamine deficiency is a recognized complication of bariatric surgery. Most patients with such vision loss have Wernicke encephalopathy with characteristic changes seen on neuroimaging. Other patients may have retinal hemorrhages, optic disc edema, and peripheral neuropathy without Wernicke encephalopathy. Patients who undergo bariatric surgery and have a thiamine deficiency can present with visual symptoms and ophthalmologic findings only visible by fundoscopy prior to developing more severe and potentially irreversible complications from the vitamin deficiency. Children deficient in vitamin E have various neurologic symptoms. A 15-year-old boy with fat malabsorption due to cystic fibrosis who was diagnosed as being vitamin E deficient (< 0.5 mg/l), had typical neuropathies. On the other hand, a 12-year-old Beduin girl had isolated vitamin E deficiency, as well as neurological symptoms suggestive of Friedrich's ataxia. The demands in vitamin B12 are particularly high in nervous tissue. Hypovitaminosis is accompanied by pathological lesions both in white and gray brain matter. Several types of neurological manifestations are described: subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord (funicular myelinosis), sensomotor polyneuropathy, optic nerve neuropathy, cognitive disorders. A 51-year-old female had been on vegetarian diet as a child, and on restrict vegan diet during the last 2 years, developing severe bilateral deterioration of visual function and polyneuropathy. Blood test revealed low levels of vitamin A, B6 and D. Nutritional visual defects are apparently uncommon nowadays in developed nations. Retinal change-related visual defects caused by hypovitaminoses may be underdiagnosed. Cobalamin deficiency neuropathy is the exception, often presenting with a non-length-dependent sensory neuropathy. Patients with cobalamin and copper deficiency neuropathy characteristically have concomitant myelopathy, whereas vitamin E deficiency is uniquely associated with a spinocerebellar syndrome. Epidemiological and clinical data show that the consequences of vitamin D deficiency are relevant to disease risk and can be observed in the progression of many diseases, especially AD, whereas higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with better cognitive test performance. Multifocal neurological dysfunction in our patient represented beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy related to vitamin B1 deficiency. We report a 25-year-old woman who developed subacute progressive weakness and areflexia followed by confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus following bariatric surgery. Vitamin B12 deficiency is one of the main complications of vegetarianism. We describe the case of a 1 month 20 days-old infant who consulted due to paroxysmal episodes of epileptogenic mechanism; laboratory tests identified a deficiency in vitamin B12 as the cause. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly persons Deficiencies of vitamin B 1, B 2 or B 6 were also found in patients with intestinal malabsorption and polyneuropathy, diabetic polyneuropathy, optic atrophy, myelopathy and cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology, neurological manifestations of neoplasms arising outside the nervous system, B 12 myeloencephalopathy and Thévenard's syndrome. Thus, individuals with genetic vitamin E deficiency and the familial hypocholesterolemias may develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and other neurologic signs and symptoms. Symptoms related to vitamin B12 deficiency may be diverse and vary from neurologic to psychiatric. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurologic manifestation of acute thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.

Skin prick test (SPT) or Phadiatop, a multi-allergen IgE screening test, was used as a tool for detecting aeroallergen sensitization.OBJECTIVE: To compare SPT and Phadiatop as a tool for diagnosis allergic rhinitis (AR) using the nasal provocation test (NPT) as a comparative standard. Skin prick test (SPT) with a wheal diameter of >3 mm, generally accepted as a positive, is most commonly use diagnostic tool for Allergic rhinitis. Considering that nasal obstruction is the most common symptom in patients with AR, the rhinomanometry (RM) test is the most indicated objective evaluation for nasal obstruction Three allergic phenotypes of rhinitis have been described in adults: allergic rhinitis (AR), local allergic rhinitis (LAR), and dual allergic rhinitis (DAR, coexistence of AR and LAR). Nevertheless, most centers follow a diagnostic approach only based on skin prick test and serum allergen-specific IgE (collectively called atopy tests, AT).  Background: Screening for the existence of aeroallergens in patients with possible allergic rhinitis using venous blood samples has become more popular, The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivities and specificities of Phadiatop tests and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in both adults and children However, AR patients can easily be diagnosed with skin prick test or allergen-specific IgE measurements in the serum, whereas NAR patients form a heterogeneous group and are difficult to diagnose because of an extensive list of different phenotypes, all varying in severity, underlying etiology and type of inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the most useful combinations of symptoms and the results of radioallergosorbent tests (RASTs) and skin prick tests (SPTs) for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.DESIGN: A prospective comparison was made of symptoms and the results of RASTs and SPTs with 7 different nasal allergies; the references used were the "consensus diagnoses" provided by 3 experts.SETTING: Nineteen general practices in The Netherlands.PATIENTS: 365 consecutive patients aged 12 or over who visited their general practitioner because of chronic or recurrent nasal symptoms between 1 March 1990 and 1 March 1991.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The most useful combinations of items from the history, RASTs, and SPTs, for the diagnosis of 7 different nasal allergies; the predictive probabilities of these combinations.RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria could be drawn up resulting in a near-perfect discrimination between patients diagnosed as having all Careful patient history, together with the skin prick test or RAST, usually allows an easy diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. IgE). Nasal challenge is the gold standard for the diagnosis of allergic rhi [Diagnostic use of enzymatic RAST skin tests and determination of eosinophils in nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis]. BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is the most frequent allergic disease, characterized by nasal symptoms consisting of rhinorrhea, nasal block-age and sneezing triggered by and IgE mediated reaction to allergens.OBJECTIVE: To validate a questionnaire for the clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A test of a test in which a questionnaire for the clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was developed and validated it in 300 subjects (150 children, 150 adults, of both genders, 2-70 years), in allergy specialized cente skin testing, RAST, and nasal provocation tests, the last mentioned, as they are performed directly on the shock organ, have so far been found to give the most accurate picture of clinically dominant allergens and of the intensity and character of the rhinitis. A clinical decision support system for diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis based on intradermal skin tests. ity ranging from 60 to 100 %. The other two evaluated the accuracy of intradermal testing as a stand-alone test for diagnosing allergic rhinitis with sensitivity ranging from 60 to 79 % and specificity ranging from 68 to 69 %.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review suggest that skin-prick testing is accurate in discriminating  Diagnostic allergy tests, such as skin tests and in vitro tests, can assist clinicians in determining whether nasal symptoms are allergic in origin. gnosis of AR. Expert commentary: AR is traditionally diagnosed with the combined evaluation of history and allergen sensitization by in vivo skin prick tests and in vitro allergen specific IgE in serum, to confirm the correlation between clinical history and potent Tools that the allergist is more likely to use include nasal cytology, skin testing and in vitro assays for specific immunoglobulin E. Patients with pure nonallergic rhinitis have negative skin tests or clinically irrelevant positive results. It was concluded that the skin prick test can be used as a screening method for patients with allergic rhinitis, while the specific IgE detection can be used as an alternative for diagnosis of patients who are susceptible to the ID test or for those who are severely susceptible to allergic rhinitis such that medication can not be withdrawn for the ID test. ity ranging from 60% to 100%.
