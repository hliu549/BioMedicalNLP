532ad4b4d6d3ac6a34000012	How is the sequence variability defined in antibodies?	Structural and immunochemical data suggest, however, that V3 contains conserved elements which explain its role in binding to virus co-receptors despite its sequence variability. This study, for the first time, describes an in-depth analysis of genetic variation in Vpr using information from global HIV-1 isolates involving a total of 976 Vpr sequences We investigated the possible link between enzyme secretion and variability in the linker sequence segment using site-directed mutagenesis and linker domain swapping to construct mutated and chimeric forms of the IgA1 protease from We have performed low to high resolution molecular typing to assess the genetic variability of major histocompatibility complex loci (HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, and -DQA1) in a large population of European American patients with IIM (n = 571) representing the major myositis autoantibody groups In this study, we analyzed the value of IHC versus that of microsatellite instability (MSI) testing in predicting mutation status of the MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes in colorectal carcinomas and adenomas, and explored the frequency and significance of immunohistochemical staining variability Computational analyses were used to position the epitope in the context of the virion-associated envelope glycoprotein complex, to determine the variability of the surrounding surface, and to calculate the surface accessibility of possible glycan- and polypeptide-epitope components.  ese variations in structure of an expression site for a major, immunoprotective outer membrane protein have important implications for vaccine development and for obtaining an improved understanding of the mechanisms of persistence of ehrlichial infections in humans, domestic animals, and reservoir hosts.  The V3 region of the isolates used in the neutralization assay was amplified by PCR, directly sequenced, and analyzed to reveal variability between the consensus HIV-1 sequences and the isolates.

58cdbaf302b8c60953000044	What are Degrons?	Specific signals (degrons) regulate protein turnover mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Portable degradation sequences, or degrons, have the ability to bind to E3 ligases and promote substrate ubiquitination when the sequence is presented in isolation or appended to other entities such as fluorescent peptide-based reporters.  The N-degrons, a set of degradation signals recognized by the N-end rule pathway, comprise a protein's destabilizing N-terminal residue and an internal lysine residue. The ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades an enormous variety of proteins that contain specific degradation signals, or 'degrons'. Degron refers to an amino acid sequence that encodes a protein degradation signal, which is oftentimes a poly-ubiquitin chain that can be transferred to other proteins.  Degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the N-end rule pathway include a set called N-degrons. The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which destabilizing N-terminal amino acids of short lived proteins are recognized by recognition components (N-recognins) as an essential element of degrons, called N-degrons The N-end rule pathway is a regulated proteolytic system that targets proteins containing destabilizing N-terminal residues (N-degrons) for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in eukaryotes More than 25 years ago, the first degradation signal was discovered and defined as destabilizing N-terminal amino-acid residue (or N-degron) of protein substrates A protein domain called "degron", which induces rapid proteolysis by the proteasome, can be used for this purpose. Degron-based technologies for the conditional depletion of POI--degron fusion proteins have been developed by exploiting various pathways leading to proteasomal degradation.

56c1f00fef6e394741000040	Describe July Effect.	It is unclear, however, if this difference was related to climatological changes or inexperienced medical trainees (the July effect).   Given the nonteaching nature of these hospitals, the findings demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the summer are more likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than the July effect. BACKGROUND: Lower quality of care and poorer outcomes are suspected when new trainees (eg, residents) start in July in teaching hospitals, the so-called "the July effect." The "August" or "July effect" describes increased errors and reduced patient safety during this transition.  PURPOSE: Researchers have found mixed results about the risk to patient safety in July, when newly minted physicians enter U.S. hospitals to begin their clinical training, the so-called "July effect." INTRODUCTION: There has been concern of increased emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) during the months when new residents are orienting to their roles. This so-called "July Effect" has long been thought to increase LOS, and potentially contribute to hospital overcrowding and increased waiting time for patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The July effect is the hypothetical increase in morbidity and mortality thought to be associated with the influx of new (or newly promoted) trainees during the first portion of the academic year. Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect. Elderly hip fracture patients treated at teaching hospitals had 12% greater relative risk of mortality in July/August (ie, experience a "July effect") compared with nonteaching hospitals during that time period (1998-2003). Many have suggested that these new medical residents may produce errors and worsen patient outcomes-the so-called "July Effect;" however, we have found no U.S. evidence documenting this effect. A &quot;July effect&quot; of increased complications when new trainees begin residency has been reported widely by the media. The July Effect thus contributed to only a 2.4% higher FTOR in teaching hospitals compared to 19% in non teaching hospitals. The July Effect is reflective of an overall increase in morbidity in all hospitals at the beginning of the academic cycle and it had a pronounced effect in non-teaching hospitals. Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect.

56b9cabbac7ad10019000002	What is the role of Caenorhabditis elegans Heterochromatin protein 1 (HPL-2) in development?	Caenorhabditis elegans Heterochromatin protein 1 (HPL-2) links developmental plasticity, longevity and lipid metabolism.  We show that HPL-2 regulates the expression of germline genes, extracellular matrix components and genes involved in lipid metabolism. Comparison of our expression data with HPL-2 ChIP-on-chip profiles reveals that a significant number of genes up- and down-regulated in the absence of HPL-2 are bound by HPL-2. Germline genes are specifically up-regulated in hpl-2 mutants, consistent with the function of HPL-2 as a repressor of ectopic germ cell fate.  HPL-2 regulates the dauer developmental decision, a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in which environmental conditions determine developmental fate. Our results suggest that the worm HP1 homologue HPL-2 may coordinately regulate dauer diapause, longevity and lipid metabolism, three processes dependent on developmental input and environmental conditions. Interestingly, lin-61 genetically interacts with two other synMuvB genes, hpl-2, an HP1 homologous H3K9me2/3 binding factor, and met-2, a SETDB1 homologous H3K9 methyl transferase (H3K9MT), in determining C. elegans vulva development and fertility. We have specifically characterized the intranuclear positioning of in vivo fluorescence of the Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 homologue HPL-2 as a marker for heterochromatin domains in developing embryos.  While HPL-2 functions in vulval and germline development, no function has so far been attributed to HPL-1. Here we report the characterization of an hpl-1 null allele. We show that while the absence of hpl-1 alone results in no obvious phenotype, hpl-1;hpl-2 double mutants show synthetic, temperature sensitive phenotypes including larval lethality and severe defects in the development of the somatic gonad. Furthermore, we find that hpl-1 has an unexpected role in vulval development by acting redundantly with hpl-2, but not other genes previously implicated in vulval development. Localization studies show that like HPL-2, HPL-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein. However, HPL-1 and HPL-2 localization does not completely overlap. Our results show that HPL-1 and HPL-2 play both unique and redundant functions in post-embryonic development. We show that one of the homologues, HPL-2, is required for the formation of a functional germline and for the development of the vulva by acting in an Rb-related pathway.  A heterochromatin protein 1 homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans acts in germline and vulval development. We have specifically characterized the intranuclear positioning of in vivo fluorescence of the Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 homologue HPL-2 as a marker for heterochromatin domains in developing embryos.

5544e4635beec11c10000007	What is the idea behind the fractal globule that has been proposed as a model of chromatin conformation in the nucleus of a cell?	The fractal globule, a self-similar compact polymer conformation where the chain is spatially segregated on all length scales, has been proposed to result from a sudden polymer collapse. This state has gained renewed interest as one of the prime candidates for the non-entangled states of DNA molecules inside cell nuclei Additionally, the strings and binders switch model reproduces the recently proposed "fractal-globule" model, but only as one of many possible transient conformations The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Next, we connect the fractal globule to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix, coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal globule conformation At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus.

54e221f6ae9738404b000010	Describe the mechanism of action of aliskiren. 	Preliminary assignment a direct renin inhibitor aliskiren enhances the diuretic, natriuretic and kaliyuretic effects of the drug.  Aliskiren: An orally active renin inhibitor. Optimization of this compound by Novartis led to the development of aliskiren - the only direct renin inhibitor which is clinically used as an antihypertensive drug. Aliskiren is a new renin inhibitor of a novel structural class that has recently been shown to be efficacious in hypertensive patients after once-daily oral dosing. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that interrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at its rate-limiting step. THE READER WILL GAIN: Aliskiren, the first approved renin inhibitor to reach the market, is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic non-peptide molecule that blocks angiotensin I generation.  TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The DRI aliskiren is an effective antihypertensive agent that preliminary data suggests has a beneficial effect in CVD and CKD.  Aliskiren is a novel molecule which blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in its rate limiting step by renin inhibition. After discovery of the first direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, which blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the first rate limiting step, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), renin has become an important target nowadays.  Aliskiren, the first orally effective direct renin inhibitor, is an effective antihypertensive agent with distinctive properties including placebo-like tolerability, pharmacologic effects that persist after drug discontinuation, and a unique mechanism of action. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor to reach the market, is a low-molecular-weight, orally active, hydrophilic nonpeptide. Aliskiren blocks Ang I generation, while plasma renin concentration increases because the drugs blocks the negative feed-back exerted by Ang II on renin synthesis. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor. One drug that emerged from this effort is aliskiren, a direct human renin inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). With its unique mechanism of action, combining aliskiren with another RAAS-blocking agent that has a different mechanism of action may provide more comprehensive blockade of the RAAS, potentially conferring additional clinical benefits.

5a6fa9f7b750ff4455000061	Describe Click-PEGylation	Click-PEGylation - A mobility shift approach to assess the redox state of cysteines in candidate proteins. One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation, we have utilised a Click chemistry approach, where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach.

In nature, cervids are infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions by oral and nasal mucosal exposure, and studies of early CWD pathogenesis have implicated pharyngeal lymphoid tissue as the earliest sites of prion accumulation. Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe.  Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in cervids (i.e., deer, elk, moose, and reindeer), and sheep scrapie, are caused by the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a disease-causing conformer (PrPSc) Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease of North American deer, elk and moose, affects both free-ranging and captive cervids. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an evolving prion disease of cervids (deer, elk and moose) that has been recognized in North America and Korea. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) in North America. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease affecting North American cervids, has been discovered in at least 12 states and provinces throughout the continent. The etiology of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a relatively new and burgeoning prion epidemic in deer, elk, and moose (members of the cervid family), is more enigmatic. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging and uniformly fatal prion disease affecting free-ranging deer and elk and is now recognized in 22 U.S. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting free-ranging and captive cervids that now occurs in 24 U.S. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious, fatal prion disease affecting cervids in a growing number of regions across North America.

Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms several published studies have consistently shown the efficacy of a gluten-free diet in rapidly controlling esophageal symptoms and in preventing their recurrence Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides. Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD). : At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001).

5aa4f47cd6d6b54f7900000a	When is 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing used?	The different pipelines that may be used in 16S rRNA gene profiling of bacterial communities are known to have a significant impact on alpha and beta diversity measures and this may prevent direct comparison of results obtained in studies using different bioinformatic approaches to analyse raw sequences.   Metataxonomics tools analyze high-throughput sequencing data, primarily from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNAseq, to identify microorganisms and viruses within a complex mixture. Two biological methods were used, Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (RISA), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing with Illumina Miseq, to evaluate the discriminating power of soil bacterial communities.  The aim of this study was to assess the integration of different approaches, genotypic (16S rRNA gene sequencing), proteomic (MALDI-TOF MS) and metabolomic (1H-NMR), for the taxonomic and metabolic characterization of Lactobacillus species.

58ede257eda5a57672000010	What is the genetic basis of the Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS)?	Circadian gene mutations are also associated with circadian rhythm disorders such as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome.  Possible association of human leucocyte antigen DR1 with delayed sleep phase syndrome. The study investigated the human leucocyte antigen (HLA), types A, B and DR, of 42 patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and compared the frequencies of the antigens with those in 117 healthy controls. The comparison revealed that the gene frequencies and positivities of HLA-A, -B and -DR, except for DR1, had no significant differences between the patients and controls. The frequency of HLA-DR1 was increased in the DSPS patients as compared with that in the healthy controls (P = 0.0069 in positivity). In human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, the incidence of DR1 positivity alone was significantly higher in DSPS patients than in healthy subjects.  Recent progress in biological clock research has facilitated genetic analysis of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome (N-24) Association of structural polymorphisms in the human period3 gene with delayed sleep phase syndrome. One of the haplotypes was significantly associated with DSPS (Bonferroni's corrected P = 0.037; odds ratio = 7.79; 95% CI 1.59-38.3) in our study population. Our results suggest that structural polymorphisms in the hPer3 gene may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DSPS. A length polymorphism in the circadian clock gene Per3 is linked to delayed sleep phase syndrome and extreme diurnal preference. Polymorphisms in the CLOCK, BMAL1, Per3 and TIMELESS genes have been associated with susceptibility to mood disorder, and single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in several circadian genes have been observed among those displaying certain circadian phenotypes, including worse mood in the evening, insomnia in mania and early, middle or late insomnia in depression.  To investigate the link between extreme diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and a length polymorphism in Per3 The Per3 polymorphism correlated significantly with extreme diurnal preference, the longer allele associating with morningness and the shorter allele with eveningness. The shorter allele was strongly associated with the delayed sleep phase syndrome patients, 75% of whom were homozygous. We studied the association between the AA-NAT gene and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). Results indicate that there is a significant difference in allele positivity at the single nucleotide polymorphism involved in an amino acid substitution from alanine to threonine at position 129 between patients with DSPS and healthy controls. The frequency of the 129 threonine allele is significantly higher in the patients than in the controls ( P=0.0029). The data suggest that AA-NAT could be a susceptibility gene for DSPS. Our results suggest that latitude has a role in the influence of hPer3 gene polymorphism on delayed sleep-phase syndrome and confirm previous data showing its association with morningness-eveningness tendencies.

5a70e88699e2c3af2600000a	Describe mechanism of action of Nusinersen.	In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Spinraza (nusinersen), the first exon skipping and exon inclusion drugs, to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively. Notably, the first new central nervous system (CNS)-targeted oligonucleotide-based drug (nusinersen/Spinraza) was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2016 and several other compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Nusinersen (SPINRAZA™) is a modified antisense oligonucleotide that binds to a specific sequence in the intron, downstream of exon 7 on the pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) of the SMN2 gene. This modulates the splicing of the SMN2 mRNA transcript to include exon 7, thereby increasing the production of full-length SMN protein. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) discovered in 2004 at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.  Spinraza™showed very promising results at all steps of the clinical development and was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 23, 2016.

5c8436f875a4a5d219000002	What is the function of PARP1?	The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification of proteins. This  consists of the attachment of mono- or poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to specific polar residues of target proteins. PARP1 is the most abundant and best-characterized member of the family of PARP enzymes. PARP1 plays key roles in DNA repair, as well as a wide variety of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin modulation, cellular signaling pathway, inflammation, cellular stress responses and so on.  Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP1) controls adipogenic gene expression and adipocyte function. PARP1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a chromatin-associated enzyme that was described to affect chromatin compaction. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1, also known as ARTD1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that plays important roles in DNA repair, gene transcription, and differentiation through the modulation of chromatin structure and function. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is known for its function in nuclear DNA repair. PARP1 regulates gene expression by numerous mechanisms, including modifying chromatin structure and altering the function of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is a nuclear zinc-finger protein with a function as a DNA damage sensor. Being a major member of Parps, Parp1 is a crucial nuclear factor with biological significance in modulating DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling through PARylation of downstream proteins. We thus hypothesized that PARP1 plays an important transcriptional role in adipogenesis and metabolism and therefore used adipocyte development and function as a model to elucidate the molecular action of PARP1 in obesity-related diseases.

517138b68ed59a060a000002	How does ranolazine affect kinase signaling activation in the heart?	support of this view, CaMKII activity was also increased in hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing a gain-of-function Na(v)1.5 mutant (N(1325)S). The effects of both ATX-II and the N(1325)S mutation were reversed by either I(NaL) inhibition (with ranolazine or tetrodotoxin) or CaMKII inhibition (with KN93 or autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide). Such changes were related to enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity and increased phosphorylation of its targets. Ranolazine at therapeutic concentrations partially reversed the HCM-related cellular abnormalities via I(NaL) inhibition, with negligible effects in controls. By shortening the action potential duration in HCM cardiomyocytes, ranolazine reduced the occurrence of early and delayed afterdepolarizations. Finally, as a result of the faster kinetics of Ca(2+)(i) transients and the lower diastolic Ca(2+)(i), ranolazine accelerated the contraction-relaxation cycle of HCM trabeculae, ameliorating diastolic function.

53175e68b166e2b806000009	What is the effect of ROS on cyclin B1?	The present study was undertaken to determine whether sulforaphane-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) might cause growth arrest and apoptosis in human bladder cancer 5637 cells. Our results show that the reduced viability of 5637 cells by sulforaphane is due to mitotic arrest, but not the G2 phase. The sulforaphane-induced mitotic arrest correlated with an induction of cyclin B1 and phosphorylation of Cdk1, as well as a concomitant increased complex between cyclin B1 and Cdk1. Further mechanistic studies revealed that induction of apoptosis is associated with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to cytosol, upregulation of Bax, p21 and p53, and down-regulation of Bcl-2, cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). LDH inhibition by oxamate induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via downregulation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 pathway and promoted apoptosis through enhancement of mitochondrial ROS generation. N-acetylcysteine, a specific scavenger of ROS, significantly blocked the growth inhibition effect induced by oxamate. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Butyrate (> 2 mm) inhibited the expression of cdc2, cdc25C and cyclinB1 mRNAs and reduced the levels of Cdc2, Cdc25C and cyclinB1 proteins in GFs, as determined using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. This toxic effect of butyrate was associated with the production of ROS. Furthermore, costunolide induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase via decrease in Cdc2, cyclin B1 and increase in p21WAF1 expression, In addition, costunolide had a slight induced effect on ROS generation. This study suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest was triggered by ROS/NO productions with regulations of p53, p21, cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which were able to be prevented by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity inhibitor genistein or JNK inhibitor SP600125. Other G(2)/M regulatory molecules such as Cdc25C, Cdk1, cyclin B1 were down-regulated by DIM. Blocking ROS generation by N-acetyl cysteine protects the cells from DIM-mediated G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that emodin mediated oxidative injury (DNA damage) based on ROS production and ER stress based on the levels of GADD153 and GRP78 that acts as an early and upstream change in the cell death cascade to caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways, triggers mitochondrial dysfunction from Bcl-2 and Bax modulation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation, consequently leading to apoptosis in SCC-4 cells. In this study, treatment of human tongue cancer SCC-4 cells with various concentrations of emodin led to G2/M arrest through promoted p21 and Chk2 expression but inhibited cyclin B1 and cdc2; Further investigation revealed that plumbagin's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Blockade of cell cycle was associated with increased levels of p21, and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, Cdc2, and Cdc25C. We also found the generation of ROS is a critical mediator in plumbagin-induced cell growth inhibition. IOA exhibited effective cell growth inhibition by inducing cancer cells to undergo G(2)-M phase arrest and apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that IOA's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Cell cycle blockade was associated with increased levels of p21 and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2, and cdc25C. We also found that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical mediator in IOA-induced cell growth inhibition.

Purpose: We describe herein a novel P447_L455 deletion in the C2 domain of PIK3CA in a patient with an ER+ breast cancer with an excellent response to the PI3Kα inhibitor alpelisib.  Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase α-Selective Inhibition With Alpelisib (BYL719) in PIK3CA-Altered Solid Tumors: Results From the First-in-Human Study. Purpose We report the first-in-human phase Ia study to our knowledge ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01219699) identifying the maximum tolerated dose and assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of single-agent alpelisib (BYL719), an oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα)-selective inhibitor.  Here, we have determined the effects of new anticancer drugs targeting specific PI3K isoforms on INaL and action potentials (APs) in mouse cardiomyocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Chronic exposure (10-100 nM; 5-48 hours) to PI3K-α-specific subunit inhibitors BYL710 (alpelisib) and A66 and a pan-PI3K inhibitor (BKM120) increased INaL in SCN5A-transfected CHO cells and mouse cardiomyocytes.  Combining ribociclib with the alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed a synergistic effect in two NPC PDX models in nude mice.  his study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC. This study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC. PURPOSE Alpelisib, a selective oral inhibitor of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110α, has shown synergistic antitumor activity with endocrine therapy against ER+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer cells. We explored whether PI3K inhibitors, buparlisib and alpelisib, enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen against ER-positive BC cells. PI3K inhibitors, including the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) and the PI3Kα-selective inhibitor alpelisib (BYL719), currently in clinical development by Novartis Oncology, may therefore be effective as anticancer agents. PURPOSE Alpelisib, a selective oral inhibitor of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110α, has shown synergistic antitumor activity with endocrine therapy against ER+/PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer cells. Patients with refractory BRAFV600-mutant metastatic CRC (mCRC) were treated with a selective RAF kinase inhibitor (encorafenib) plus a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR (cetuximab), with (n = 28) or without (n = 26) a PI3Kα inhibitor (alpelisib). Combining ribociclib with the alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib showed a synergistic effect in two NPC PDX models in nude mice. We assessed the safety and activity of alpelisib, an oral, selective PI3K p110α inhibitor, plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study aimed to assess the safety and activity of alpelisib (a PI3Kα isoform-specific inhibitor) with T-DM1 in trastuzumab- and taxane-resistant HER2-positive MBC.<br><b>METHODS</b>: Patients with HER2-positive MBC that had progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy were treated with alpelisib daily and T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Septins belong to the GTPase superclass of proteins and have been functionally implicated in cytokinesis and the maintenance of cellular morphology. Septins are important components of the cytoskeleton that are highly conserved in eukaryotes and play major roles in cytokinesis, patterning, and many developmental processes. The septins also appear to be involved in various other aspects of the organization of the cell surface. Septins are a family of eukaryotic GTP binding proteins conserved from yeasts to humans. Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions, including cell division and morphogenesis. Septin proteins are conserved structural proteins that often demarcate regions of cell division. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that form filaments and higher-order structures on the cell cortex of eukaryotic cells and associate with actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks.

Ear acupressure (EAP) and ear acupuncture have been used for smoking cessation, and some positive results have been reported Auricular (ear) acupressure has been purported to be beneficial in achieving smoking cessation in some studies, while in others has been deemed insignificant Acupuncture combined with auricular point sticking and pressing has reliable therapeutic effect for smoking cessation Acupuncture has been promoted as a treatment modality for smoking cessation. However, its efficacy still remains controversial Our results showed that auricular acupuncture did not have a better efficacy in smoking cessation compared to sham acupuncture. Combined acupuncture with behavior counseling or with nicotine replacement therapy should be used in further smoking cessation trials to enhance the success rate of smoking cessation. Combining ten studies showed auricular acupuncture at 'correct' points to be more effective than control interventions, odds ratio 2.24 (95% CI 1.61, 3.10), Auricular acupuncture appears to be effective for smoking cessation, but the effect may not depend on point location. The combination of auricular acupressure and Internet-assisted smoking cessation program was more efficacious than auricular acupressure alone in terms of quit rate. auricular acupuncture in smoking cessation has some effect. With a one-year success rate of 41.1% ear acupuncture is a competitive alternative to orthodox medicine withdrawal methods.

Acupuncture and education, alone and in combination, significantly reduce smoking; however, combined they show a significantly greater effect, as seen in subjects with a greater pack-year history. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of laser acupuncture treatment in adolescent smokers.  Thus, there was no significant difference in the rates of smoking cessation in the treatment and control groups. This simple ear electroacupuncture treatment was significantly more effective in helping volunteers to quit smoking than placebo treatment.

531881acb166e2b806000017	What is the role of Hsp90 inhibition in cancer therapy?	Geldanamycin (GA) can be considered a relatively new component with a promising mode of action against human malignancies. It specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone. In toto, we have evinced the dose-dependent and cell line-specific actions of geldanamycin on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of critical Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling -oncogenic- integrity. Low-dose Hsp90 inhibitors tumor-selectively sensitize bladder cancer cells to chemoradiotherapy Hsp90 inhibitors at low concentrations, which did not exert cytocidal effects but inactivated key anti-apoptotic proteins including erbB2, Akt, and NF-κB, efficiently sensitized bladder cancer cells (T24, 5637 and UM-UC-3 cells) to in vitro CRT by enhancing apoptosis. In mice UM-UC-3 tumor xenografts model, Hsp90 inhibitors successfully potentiated anti-tumor activity of CRT. The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), which simultaneously inactivated both Akt and ERK signaling at noncytocidal concentrations, synergistically potentiated the cytotoxicity of CDDP against BCICs by enhancing CDDP-induced apoptosis in vitro. We have demonstrated that, upon 17-AAG treatment, bladder cancer cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and eventually undergo apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 17-AAG administration was shown to induce a pronounced downregulation of multiple Hsp90 protein clients and other downstream effectors, such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-α, IKK-β, FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, resulting in sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-κB, reduced cell proliferation and decline of cell motility. In total, we have clearly evinced a dose-dependent and cell type-specific effect of 17-AAG on cell cycle progression, survival and motility of human bladder cancer cells, due to downregulation of multiple Hsp90 clients and subsequent disruption of signaling integrity. Low dose geldanamycin inhibits hepatocyte growth factor and hypoxia-stimulated invasion of cancer cells GA downregulated Met by inhibiting new protein maturation, thereby dampening HGF signaling. HGF and chemical hypoxia with CoCl2 cooperatively promoted in vitro invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, while CoCl2 but not HGF activated urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase 2, both of which promote invasion and angiogenesis. Low dose GA (100 nmol/L) inhibited these processes by suppressing both HGF and HIF-1 pathways. Notably, brief GA pretreatment inhibited in vitro invasion and VEGF secretion induced by HGF as effectively as did continuous treatment. Moreover, we found that GA inhibited activation of focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion assembly, and actin reorganization induced by HGF and integrin engagement by extracellular matrix. GA widely suppresses extrinsic stimuli-induced signaling that contribute to tumor invasion and angiogenesis in this bladder carcinoma model, suggesting the utility of Hsp90 inhibitors in preventing tumor progression and metastasis. upon geldanamycin treatment, bladder cancer cells are prominently arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle and eventually undergo programmed cell death via combined activation of apoptosis and autophagy. geldanamycin administration proved to induce prominent downregulation of several Hsp90 protein clients and downstream effectors, such as membrane receptors (IGF-IR and c-Met), protein kinases (Akt, IKKα, IKKβ and Erk1/2) and transcription factors (FOXOs and NF-κΒ), therefore resulting in the impairment of proliferative -oncogenic- signaling and reduction of cell motility 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic, specifically targets heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and interferes with its function as a molecular chaperone that maintains the structural and functional integrity of various protein clients involved in cellular signalin	['Hsp90 inhibition is followed by G1/S cell cycle arrest, downregulation of key signalling proteins such as IGF-IR, Akt, IKK-α, IKK-β, FOXO1, ERK1/2 and c-Met, and sequestration-mediated inactivation of NF-κB, resulting in disruption of oncogenic signalling integrity, reduced cell proliferation, decline of cell motility, enhanced apoptotic cell death, and finally, sensitization of cancer cells to additional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.']

515b1eccd24251bc050000af	What is the advantage of using long nano columns in proteomics?	Our results indicate that this simplified one-shot proteomics approach with long monolithic columns is advantageous for rapid, deep, sensitive, and reproducible proteome analysis. Rapid and deep profiling of human induced pluripotent stem cell proteome by one-shot NanoLC-MS/MS analysis with meter-scale monolithic silica columns. Here, we describe an in-house built ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, with little complexity in design and high separation power combined with convenience in operation With the longest gradient we identified over 4500 protein groups and more than 26,000 unique peptides from 1 μg of a human cancer cell lysate in a single run using an Orbitrap Velos - a level of performance often seen solely using multidimensional separation strategies Our data demonstrate that the combination of UHPLC with high resolution mass spectrometry at increased sequencing speeds enables extensive proteome analysis in single runs. The experimental results showed that the numbers of identified peptides and proteins were maximized and reached a plateau with a gradient time of several tens of hours, which indicated that our model to optimize one dimensional HPLC conditions with a long column could be verified and useful. In this study, we combined well-approved techniques, namely elevated chromatographic temperatures, long RP columns and the multidimensional protein identification technology MudPIT to achieve high proteome coverage. Also, a high identification rate for the challenging integral membrane proteins was achieved. High-efficiency liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry separations with 50 mm, 250 mm, and 1 m long polymer-based monolithic capillary columns for the characterization of complex proteolytic digests. For the analysis of a proteolytic digest of Escherichia coli proteins a monolithic capillary column of 1m in length was used, yielding a peak capacity of 1038 when applying a 600 min gradient. . It was found that very high resolutions are attainable at long gradient times with long columns. The resolution continuously became higher as the gradient time and the column length became longer except in some special cases. , such separations should be advantageous when very high resolutions are required like in proteomics research.

58a2ccec60087bc10a000003	What is the composition of the gamma-secretase complex?	Gamma-secretase is a widely expressed multisubunit enzyme complex which is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and hematopoietic malignancies through its aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch1, respectively. Presenilin (PS1 or PS2) is the catalytic component of the gamma-secretase complex, which mediates the final proteolytic processing step leading to the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-characterizing amyloid beta-peptide.  gamma-Secretase is a membrane-embedded multi-protein complex that catalyzes the final cut of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-beta peptides of variable length (37-43 amino acids) via an unusual intramembrane cleavage. The gamma-secretase complex processes substrate proteins within membranes and consists of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. PS harbours the enzymatic activity of the complex, and there are two mammalian PS homologues: PS1 and PS2.  gamma-Secretase is known to contain four major protein constituents: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, all of which are integral membrane proteins.  Here we describe the association of all four components of the gamma-secretase complex, namely presenilin 1 (PS1)-derived fragments, mature nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, with cholesterol-rich detergent insoluble membrane (DIM) domains of non-neuronal cells and neurons that fulfill the criteria of lipid rafts.  In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with gamma-secretase complex components and for formation of an active gamma-secretase complex. Active gamma-secretase is a tetrameric protein complex consisting of presenilin-1 (or -2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and Aph-1a (or -1b). The gamma-secretase complex processes substrate proteins within membranes and consists of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Maturation of exogenous NCT, gamma-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. gamma-Secretase complexes containing N- and C-terminal fragments of different presenilin origin retain normal gamma-secretase activity. Co-overexpression of presenilin-1 or APH-1 abrogated gamma-secretase inhibition probably through prevention of the incorporation of CRB2 into the gamma-secretase complex We conclude that a PS1/Pen2/Aph1a trimeric complex is an active enzyme, displaying biochemical properties similar to those of gamma-secretase and roughly 50% of its activity when normalized to PS1 N-terminal fragment levels γ-Secretase is involved in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and of many other important physiological substrates. γ-secretase is a multiproteic complex made of four main core components, namely presenilin 1 or 2, APH-1, PEN-2, and Nicastrin Amyloid precursor protein associates with a nicastrin-dependent docking site on the presenilin 1-gamma-secretase complex in cells demonstrated by fluorescence lifetime imaging. Activity-dependent isolation of the presenilin- gamma -secretase complex reveals nicastrin and a gamma substrate. Characterization of the reconstituted gamma-secretase complex from Sf9 cells co-expressing presenilin 1, nicastrin [correction of nacastrin], aph-1a, and pen-2. p53-Dependent Aph-1 and Pen-2 anti-apoptotic phenotype requires the integrity of the gamma-secretase complex but is independent of its activity. Here we show that all known gamma-secretase complexes are active in APP processing and that all combinations of APH-1 variants with either FAD mutant PS1 or PS2 support pathogenic Abeta(42) production.  To characterize the functional similarity between complexes of various PS composition, we analysed PS1, PS2, and chimeric PS composed of the NTF from PS1 and CTF from PS2, or vice versa, in assembly and function of the gamma-secretase complex. While beta-secretase is a classical aspartyl protease, gamma-secretase activity is associated with a high molecular weight complex. One of the complex components, which is critically required for gamma-secretase activity is nicastrin (NCT). Here we investigate the assembly of NCT into the gamma-secretase complex. Maturation of exogenous NCT, gamma-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. This revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of NCT is dispensable for gamma-secretase complex assembly and function. In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with gamma-secretase complex components and for formation of an active gamma-secretase complex.

In PS1(-/-)/PS2(-/-) and NCT(-/-) fibroblasts, gamma-secretase components that still remain fail to become detergent-resistant, suggesting that raft association requires gamma-secretase complex assembly.

We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.

58b6a42522d300530900000b	What is the function of transthyretin in cerebrospinal fluid?	Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein that binds and distributes thyroid hormones (THs). TTR synthesised in the liver is secreted into the bloodstream and distributes THs around the body, whereas TTR synthesised in the choroid plexus is involved in movement of thyroxine from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid and the distribution of THs in the brain. This is important because an adequate amount of TH is required for normal development of the brain.  The choroid plexus forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In reptiles, birds and mammals, the main protein synthesized and secreted by the choroid plexus is a thyroid hormone distributor protein: transthyretin. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth.  Transthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.  Serum TH binding proteins play a major role for the availability of TH since only free hormone concentrations may dictate cellular uptake. One of these proteins, transthyretin is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after being secreted by the choroid plexus. Entry routes into the brain like the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-CSF-barrier will be explicated regarding fetal and adult status.  Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.  Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein secreted by the liver and choroid plexus, is mainly known as the physiological carrier of thyroxine (T(4)) and retinol.  The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-circulating homotetrameric protein Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric serum and cerebrospinal fluid protein that transports both thyroxine (T(4)) and the retinol-retinol binding protein complex (holoRBP) Dose-dependent transthyretin inhibition of T4 uptake from cerebrospinal fluid in sheep. The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain. High-affinity cellular binding sites for TTR have been described; however, their function and that of choroid plexus synthesis of TTR and transport of T4 into the cerebrospinal fluid remain unclear. Transthyretin is the major thyroxine-binding protein in the plasma of rodents, and the main thyroxine-binding protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of both rodents and humans. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid.	['Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein synthesized in the choroid plexus, which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

5539062dbc4f83e828000013	What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?	Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Aberrant patterns of H3K4 and H3K27 histone lysine methylation occur across subgroups in medulloblastoma. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors.	['Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.']
56f82a39cf1c325851000001	What is protein carbamylation?	urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues.  Carbamylation describes a nonenzymatic posttranslational protein modification mediated by cyanate, a dissociation product of urea.  Cyanate, a reactive electrophilic species in equilibrium with urea, posttranslationally modifies proteins through a process called carbamylation, which promotes atherosclerosis.  Protein carbamylation, a posttranslational modification promoted during uremia and catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) at sites of inflammation, is linked to altered protein structure, vascular dysfunction, and poor prognosis.  Carbamylation (carbamoylation) of lysine residues and protein N-termini is a nonenzymatic PTM that has been related to protein ageing. In contrast to other PTM, such as phosphorylation, carbamylation can be artificially introduced during sample preparation with urea, thus affecting studies directed toward in vivo carbamylation.  Carbamylation is a general process involved in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups.  Protein carbamylation is one of the important post-translational modifications, which plays a pivotal role in a number of biological conditions, such as diseases, chronic renal failure and atherosclerosis. Protein carbamylation is a post-translational modification that can occur in the presence of urea. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines, arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines.  Carbamylation of proteins through reactive cyanate has been demonstrated to predict an increased cardiovascular risk.  Protein carbamylation is of great concern both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we report the first structural characterization of a protein carbamylated at the N-terminal proline.  Post-translational modification and functional impairment of proteins through carbamylation is thought to promote vascular dysfunction during end-stage renal disease. Cyanate, a reactive species in equilibrium with urea, carbamylates protein lysine residues to form epsilon-carbamyllysine (homocitrulline), altering protein structure and function.

Some ion channels are directly implemented in chemical signaling pathways, the others are involved in regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentrations, pH, cell volume, and membrane potentials. Together with ion transporters and gap junction complexes, ion channels form steady-state voltage gradients across the cell membranes in nonexcitable cells. These membrane potentials are involved in regulation of such processes as migration guidance, cell proliferation, and body axis patterning during development and regeneration. While the importance of membrane potential in stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation is evident, the mechanisms of this bioelectric control of stem cell activity are still not well understood, and the role of specific ion channels in these processes remains unclear. Here we introduce the flatworm Macrostomum lignano as a versatile model organism for addressing these topics.

This analysis demonstrates the dual role of P-bodies as decay sites and storage areas under regular and stress conditions.  mRNA P-bodies (processing bodies) harbour much of the mRNA decay machinery P-bodies contain the mRNA decay and translational repression machineries  P-bodies belong to a large family of RNA granules that are associated with post-transcriptional gene regulation, conserved from yeast to mammals, and influence biological processes ranging from germ cell development to neuronal plasticity.

5a89528dfcd1d6a10c000001	Where do centromeres locate according to the Rabl orientation of eukaryotic nuclei?	This was taken as good evidence for the maintenance of the chromosome arrangement - the Rabl orientation - and of the peripheral location of the centromere and its association with the nuclear membrane. Within this general arrangement homologous telocentric chromosomes were frequently seen to have their centromeres associated or directed towards each other. The role of the centromere in somatic association as a spindle fibre attachment and chromosome binder is discussed. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear membrane  telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. We suggest that centromeric and other highly repeated non-transcribed sequence domains may act as general organizing centers for cell type specific interphase patterns that are conserved in mammalian evolution.  Centromere clustering is a major determinant of yeast interphase nuclear organization During interphase in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are clustered near one pole of the nucleus as a rosette with the spindle pole body at its hub. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres.  We show that most of this preferential association is not due to vegetative (also known as somatic) pairing but is caused by the polar orientation of interphase chromosomes (Rabl orientation) These developments are discussed in this contribution, with particular reference to the centromere and the nucleolus organizer.

52ed264a98d023950500002f	Provide examples of how molecular transporters contribute to multi-drug resistance in bacteria.	 One of the common mechanisms of multidrug resistance in eukaryotic cells is the active efflux of a broad range of xenobiotics through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Overall, the phylogenetic diversity of As-resistant bacteria in underground water was very limited if compared with lentic and lotic waters. Lastly, our molecular data support the hypothesis that the horizontal gene transfer of ars in As-containing freshwater environments is not limited to closely-related genomes, but also occurs between bacteria that are distant from an evolutionary viewpoint, thereby indicating that such genetic events may be considered a source of microbial resistance to arsenic-toxicity. We postulate that the RND transporter All3143 and the predicted membrane fusion protein All3144, as homologs of E. coli AcrB and AcrA, respectively, are major players for antibiotic resistance in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. These observations suggest a physiological association between c-di-AMP and the MDR transporters and support the model that MDR transporters mediate c-di-AMP secretion to regulate peptidoglycan synthesis in response to cell wall stress. Our data suggest that SmbFT truly displays immunity function and confer protection against Smb and structurally similar lantibiotics. This study indicates that the tetA gene decreases sensitivity to tigecycline in Salmonella spp. at a low level. With additional resistance mechanisms, tetA-carrying strains can reach the breakpoint for tigecycline resistance. Efflux pump inhibitors may inhibit the major AcrAB-TolC in Salmonella efflux systems which are the major efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance in Gram-negative clinical isolates. (RND)-type efflux transporters play the main role in intrinsic resistance to various antimicrobial agents in many gram-negative bacteria. Here, we estimated 12 RND-type efflux transporter genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus.	["MDR efflux pumps began causing clinical problems relatively recently, in parallel with the extensive use of antibiotics in medicine and as supplements in animal feeds. However, our analyses indicate that these MDR efflux pumps did not arise through recent mutations in genes encoding transporters that changed their substrate specificities.\n\nInstead, such MDR pumps are encoded within the genomes of virtually all microorganisms, so these genes are present and thus need only to be activated to become problematic. Moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. Finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs)."]

5162af0f298dcd4e51000045	What is the role of deadenylases in the cell?	Deadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA is a mechanism critical for mRNA function by influencing mRNA turnover and efficiency of protein synthesis. In short, PARN is a divalent metal-ion dependent poly(A)-specific, processive and cap-interacting 3'-5' exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs. Distinct roles of the R3H and RRM domains in poly(A)-specific ribonuclease structural integrity and catalysis. Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product. Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain. miRNA-mediated deadenylation is orchestrated by GW182 through two conserved motifs that interact with CCR4-NOT. The rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation is the removal of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases. Purified PUM complexes were found to contain subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complex, which contains multiple enzymes that catalyze mRNA deadenylation. These findings demonstrate a conserved mechanism of PUF-mediated repression via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. The activity and selectivity of fission yeast Pop2p are affected by a high affinity for Zn2+ and Mn2+ in the active site. In eukaryotic organisms, initiation of mRNA turnover is controlled by progressive shortening of the poly-A tail, a process involving the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and its two associated 3'-5' exonucleases, Ccr4p and Pop2p (Caf1p). Here, we show biochemically and structurally that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Pop2p prefers Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) over Mg(2+) at the concentrations of the ions found inside cells and that the identity of the ions in the active site affects the activity of the enzyme. The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on virtually all mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as "deadenylation." Deadenylation is a widespread means of controlling mRNA stability and translation. Dynamic changes of the lengths of mRNA poly(A) tails are catalysed by diverse deadenylase enzymes. In eukaryotes, shortening of the 3'-poly(A) tail is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of most mRNAs, and two major mRNA deadenylase complexes--Caf1-Ccr4 and Pan2-Pan3--play central roles in this process, referred to as deadenylation. Previously, we demonstrated that eukaryotic releasing factor eRF3 mediates deadenylation and decay of mRNA in a manner coupled to translation termination. PUF protein-mediated deadenylation is catalyzed by Ccr4p. Deadenylation of mRNA is often the first and rate-limiting step in mRNA decay. PARN, a poly(A)-specific 3' --> 5' ribonuclease which is conserved in many eukaryotes, has been proposed to be primarily responsible for such a reaction, yet the importance of the PARN function at the whole-organism level has not been demonstrated in any species. The trypanosomal deadenylase activity is a 3'-->5' exonuclease specific for adenylate residues, generates 5'-AMP as a product, is magnesium dependent, and is inhibited by neomycin B sulfate. Identification of multiple RNA features that influence CCR4 deadenylation activity. The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA. PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells. Thus, deadenylation and the participating deadenylases are not simply required for preparing mRNA substrates; they play an indispensable role both structurally and functionally in P-body formation and regulation. In this context, the wide repertoire of RBPs and molecules that regulate PARN activity, together with the established role of deadenylases in miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA expression, suggest that mRNA turnover is more complex than it was previously thought and PARN holds a key role in this process. A set of multiple poly(A)-specific deadenylases has been identified, some, if not most, of which are likely to play a role in the key first step of mRNA turnover--the regulated shortening of the poly(A) tail.	['The 3\'-poly(A) tail, found on mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as "deadenylation" which is carried out by deadenylases. Deadenylases are magnesium dependent exoribonucleases that specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3\'-->5\' direction with the release of 5\'-AMP as the product. They consist of three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain.']
5e4700e03f54159529000015	What is RiboTag profiling?	RiboTag is a flexible tool for measuring the translational state of targeted cells in heterogeneous cell cultures. Here we describe our adaptation of a ribosomal capture strategy that was designed to be used in transgenic mice expressing tagged ribosomal subunits (RiboTag) in specific cell types, thereby allowing measurement of translating RNAs from desired cell types within complex tissues. Using this strategy we were able to isolate and analyze neuron-specific RNA despite the presence of glia by co-transfecting experimental plasmids with plasmids that selectively express RiboTag in neurons. RiboTag immunoprecipitation was capable of recovering high integrity RNA from small numbers of transfected cells that can then be interrogated by a variety of methods (e.g., RT-qPCR, PCR array, RNA-Seq) and compared with basal RNA expression of the entire culture. Additionally, we demonstrate how co-transfection of RiboTag with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs can validate and accurately assess the degree of gene expression knockdown, and how RiboTag can be used to measure receptor-mediated gene regulation with transiently expressed designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). RiboTag co-transfection represents a convenient and powerful tool to isolate RNA from a specific subset of cultured cells with a variety of applications for experiments in vitro.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be a key component of the senescence-related secretome and a direct mediator of cellular senescence. In murine models of accelerated aging, genetic deficiency and targeted inhibition of PAI-1 protect against aging-like pathology and prolong life span. However, the role of PAI-1 in human longevity remains unclear Our study indicates a causal effect of PAI-1 on human longevity, which may be mediated by alterations in metabolism PAI-1 4G/4G genotype appeared to be associated with lower non-cardiovascular mortality in men, but with greater cardiovascular mortality in women.  However, in centenarians there was a significantly higher frequency of the 4G allele and of the homozygous 4G4G genotype associated with high PAI-1 levels. Since high PAI-1 is considered a predictor of recurrent myocardial infarction in young men, it is intriguing that the corresponding genetic marker is more frequent in centenarians who have escaped major age-related atherothrombotic disease and reached the extreme limits of human life. Homozygosity for the 4G allele, despite its association with impaired fibrinolysis, is compatible with successful aging.

52bf1df903868f1b06000013	What is the mechanism of action of Nalmefene?	Opioids that stimulate the μ-opioid receptor (MOR1) are the most frequently prescribed and effective analgesics. Here we present a structural model of MOR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show a ligand-dependent increase in the conformational flexibility of the third intracellular loop that couples with the G protein complex. These simulations likewise identified residues that form frequent contacts with ligands. We validated the binding residues using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with radioligand binding and functional assays. The model was used to blindly screen a library of ∼1.2 million compounds. From the 34 compounds predicted to be strong binders, the top three candidates were examined using biochemical assays. One compound showed high efficacy and potency. Post hoc testing revealed this compound to be nalmefene, a potent clinically used antagonist, thus further validating the model.  The neurobiological mechanism by which opioid modulators affect drinking behavior is based on the strong connection between the endogenous opioid system, the dopamine system and the influence of the CNS stress response. Naltrexone- and to a lesser extent nalmefene- is an agent that modulates opioidergic transmission in the CNS and it shows a limited but well-studied efficacy in treating alcohol dependence.  Several derivatives of Naltrexone, Nalmefene (Nal) and JKB-119, exert immunomodulatory activity; however, unlike Nal, JKB-119 does not show significant opioid receptor antagonism.

56c4bbfdb04e159d0e000002	What are piggyBAC transposons?	The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis.  The use of nonviral gene delivery approaches in conjunction with the latest generation transposon technology based on Sleeping Beauty (SB) or piggyBac transposons may potentially overcome some of these limitations.  DNA transposons have emerged as flexible and efficient molecular vehicles to mediate stable cargo transfer. However, the ability to carry DNA fragments>10 kb is limited in most DNA transposons. Here, we show that the DNA transposon piggyBac can mobilize 100-kb DNA fragments in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, making it the only known transposon with such a large cargo capacity. The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo. Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint. The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications. In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences Among the transposons active in mammalian cells, the moth-derived transposon piggyBac is most promising with its highly efficient transposition, large cargo capacity, and precise repair of the donor site Transposons are promising systems for somatic gene integration because they can not only integrate exogenous genes efficiently, but also be delivered to a variety of organs using a range of transfection methods. piggyBac (PB) transposon has a high transposability in mammalian cells in vitro, and has been used for genetic and preclinical studies Simple piggyBac transposon-based mammalian cell expression system for inducible protein production. The piggyBac transposon displays local and distant reintegration preferences and can cause mutations at noncanonical integration sites. The piggyBac transposon was developed as an alternative mutagenic vector for mutagenesis of non-P-element targeted genes in Drosophila because the piggyBac transposon can more randomly integrate into the genome. Previous studies suggested that the piggyBac transposon always excises precisely from the insertion site without initiating a deletion or leaving behind an additional footprint. A single injection of piggyBac transposons could achieve long-term inducible gene expression in the livers of mice in vivo, confirming our multiple-transposon strategy used in cultured cells. The plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system enables constitutive or inducible gene expression in vivo for potential therapeutic and biological applications without using viral vectors. In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences. Flow cytometry of cell clones derived from a single multiplexed transfection demonstrated approximately 60% (three transposons) or approximately 30% (four transposons) stable coexpression of all delivered transgenes with selection for a single marker transposon.

56cad5df5795f9a73e000020	Where does TDP43 localize in ALS neurons?	In control motor neurons, TDP43 was almost exclusively nuclear, whereas in ALS spinal motor neurons, TDP43 was predominantly localized to the cytosol and not the nucleus.  The FUS/TLS protein binds to RNA, functions in diverse processes, and is normally located predominantly in the nucleus. In contrast, the mutant forms of FUS/TLS accumulated in the cytoplasm of neurons, a pathology that is similar to that of the gene TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), whose mutations also cause ALS. Neuronal cytoplasmic protein aggregation and defective RNA metabolism thus appear to be common pathogenic mechanisms involved in ALS and possibly in other neurodegenerative disorders. In control motor neurons, TDP43 was almost exclusively nuclear, whereas in ALS spinal motor neurons, TDP43 was predominantly localized to the cytosol and not the nucleus.

BACKGROUND: Patients with crowned dens syndrome (CDS), which is pseudogout of the atlantoaxial junction induced by "crown-like" calcifications around the dens, present with symptoms of severe neck pain, rigidity, and high fever.  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Crowned dens syndrome (CDS) is a rare form of calcium phosphate crystal depositions and often presents with recurrent neck pain, stiffness of neck, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and episodes of fever. A CT scan revealed calcification of the transverse ligament and crown-like calcification around the odontoid process. According to the clinical and radiological findings, she was diagnosed with crowned dens syndrome (CDS). Crystal deposition in the cervical spine around the odontoid process may lead to acute neck pain. This rare condition is called crowned dens syndrome and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a possible etiology for fever, headache and cervical pain of unknown origin.  Crowned dens syndrome (CDS), related to microcrystalline deposition in the periodontoid process, is the main cause of acute or chronic cervical pain. Axial calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPDD) is well known for cervical spine involvement with the crowned dens syndrome but other localisations are probably underdiagnosed in sterile spondylodiscitis.  We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features. FDG uptake in the immediate vicinity of the odontoid process, with a crownlike calcification, was identified on the CT scan on the posterior side of the dens, thus confirming the diagnosis of crowned dens syndrome.

587f8324d8d850a152000003	What is the link between Ctf4 and Chl1 in cohesion establishment?	Ctf4 Links DNA Replication with Sister Chromatid Cohesion Establishment by Recruiting the Chl1 Helicase to the Replisome. The Eco1 acetyltransferase, helped by factors including Ctf4 and Chl1, concomitantly acetylates the chromosomal cohesin complex to stabilize its cohesive links. Here we show that Ctf4 recruits the Chl1 helicase to the replisome via a conserved interaction motif that Chl1 shares with GINS and polymerase α. The Chl1 helicase facilitates replication fork progression under conditions of nucleotide depletion, partly independently of Ctf4 interaction. Conversely, Ctf4 interaction, but not helicase activity, is required for Chl1's role in sister chromatid cohesion. A physical interaction between Chl1 and the cohesin complex during S phase suggests that Chl1 contacts cohesin to facilitate its acetylation. Our results reveal how Ctf4 forms a replisomal interaction hub that coordinates replication fork progression and sister chromatid cohesion establishment. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.

530b7ae4970c65fa6b00000b	what is the role of TGFbeta in cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury?	Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a crucial role in cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation while promoting myofibroblast phenotypic modulation and extracellular matrix deposition. We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor β signaling pathways. Direct examination of heart regeneration after mechanical or genetic ablation injuries indicated that these pathways are activated in regenerating cardiomyocytes and that they can be pharmacologically manipulated to inhibit or enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation during adult heart regeneration.  Transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenic protein and Wnt pathways interact to form a complex signaling network that is critical in regulating the fate choices of both stromal and tissue-specific resident stem cells (TSCs), determining whether functional regeneration or the formation of scar tissue follows an injury.  In the adult heart under pressure overload, Notch inhibited the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and transforming growth factor-β/connective tissue growth factor-mediated cardiac fibrosis. EMT and CSps formation is enhanced in the presence of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and drastically blocked by the type I TGFβ-receptor inhibitor SB431452, indicating that TGFβ-dependent EMT is essential for the formation of these niche-like 3D-multicellular clusters. Since TGFβ is activated in the myocardium in response to injury, our data suggest that CSps formation mimics an adaptive mechanism that could potentially be enhanced to increase in vivo or ex vivo regenerative potential of adult CPCs. During the proliferative phase of healing, infarct fibroblasts undergo myofibroblast transdifferentiation forming stress fibers and expressing contractile proteins (such as α-smooth muscle actin). Mechanical stress, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad3 signaling and alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix induce acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype.  Collectively, this data strongly suggests Wnt3a promotes the formation of a myofibroblast-like phenotype in cultured fibroblasts, in part, by upregulating TGF-β signaling through SMAD2 in a β-catenin-dependent mechanism. As myofibroblasts are critical regulators of wound healing responses, these findings may have important implications for our understanding of normal and aberrant injury and repair events. Conversely, exogenous addition of TGF-beta to the wound increased VIC activation, proliferation, wound closure rate, and stress fibers. Thus, wounding activates VICs, and TGF-beta signaling modulates VIC response to injury.

TGF-beta interacts with bone morphogenic protein and Wnt pathways to form a complex signaling network that is critical in regulating the fate choices of both stromal and tissue-specific resident stem cells, determining whether functional regeneration or the formation of scar tissue follows an injury. In addition, TGF-beta enhances the formation of cardiospheres and could potentially enhance the regenerative potential of adult cardiac progenitor cells.']

CONCLUSION: Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors.  Dental x-rays and risk of meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to some dental x-rays performed in the past, when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era, appears to be associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma.  n the present article the authors review the literature relating to radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs). Emphasis is placed on meningiomas resulting from childhood treatment for primary brain tumor or tinea capitis, exposure to dental x-rays, and exposure to atomic explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Frequency of full-mouth dental X-ray examinations after age 25 related to both glioma (P for trend = 0.04) and meningioma risk (P for trend = 0.06). In brain tumor studies, the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies. BACKGROUND  This study evaluates the risk of benign brain tumors (BBTs) and malignant brain tumors (MBTs) associated with dental diagnostic X-ray, using a large population-based case-control study. In a few studies examining health effects related to dental X-ray exposure, possibly increased risks of meningioma and thyroid cancer were suggested. No significant association was found between MBTs and dental diagnostic X-ray exposure. We found a statistically significant positive association of brain cancer with reported exposure to dental X-rays. CONCLUSION  Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors. Prospective studies, based on dental X-ray records and patient follow-up, are needed to test the hypothesis further and clarify the possible cancer risk associated with dental radiography, as although the risk at the individual level, particularly with improved technology/equipment, is likely to be very low, the proportion of the population exposed is high. In brain tumor studies , the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies CONCLUSIONS Exposure to dental diagnostic X-rays in oral and maxillofacial care increases the risk of BBTs, but not MBTs. With the objective to inform clinical practice and guidelines, we synthesized the current epidemiological evidence on the association between dental X-rays and the risk of thyroid cancer, meningioma, and other cancers of the head and neck region. In brain tumor studies, the association between dental X-ray exposure and meningioma was statistically significant in 5 of the 7 studies. In a few studies examining health effects related to dental X-ray exposure, possibly increased risks of meningioma and thyroid cancer were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to dental diagnostic X-rays in oral and maxillofacial care increases the risk of BBTs, but not MBTs. CONCLUSION: Our finding of a total lack of correlation between benign brain tumors and markers of oral health and, by implication, dental X-rays, suggests there may be no relationship between dental X-rays and meningioma or other benign brain tumors. Exposure to some dental x-rays performed in the past, when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era, appears to be associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma.	['There is data to suggest that dental x-ray can be associated with significantly increased risk of meningiomas and gliomas.

Here we present a framework for inferring cancer-related gene overexpression resulting from CRE reorganization (e.g., enhancer hijacking) by integrating SCNAs, gene expression data and information on topologically associating domains (TADs). We additionally pursued cancer-type-specific analyses and uncovered IGF2 as a target for enhancer hijacking in colorectal cancer.  New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate PRDM6.  Importantly, such variants could affect enhancer regulation by changing transcription factor bindings or enhancer hijacking, and in turn, make an essential contribution to disease progression. We demonstrate a novel approach for simultaneous detection of genomic rearrangements and enhancer activity in tumor biopsies. We identify novel mechanisms of enhancer-driven regulation of the oncogenes MYC and BCL6, and show that the BCL6 locus can serve as an enhancer donor in an "enhancer hijacking" translocation.	['Enhancer hijacking is the molecular process through which a structural variant removes or moves a TAD boundary to expose TSSs to regulatory enhancers from which they would normally be insulated.']
5c5f39011a4c55d80b000027	What is Burning Mouth Syndrome(BMS)?	Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain syndrome that primarily affects peri- and postmenopausal women. It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia. Primary burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is defined as an "intraoral burning or dysaesthetic sensation, recurring daily… more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions" (IHS 2013). Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic orofacial pain disorder that is defined by a burning sensation in the oral mucosa. Burning mouth syndrome.Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings.  Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning, painful sensation of the oral mucosa that most commonly involves the anterior tongue. Burning mouth syndrome is a complicated, poorly understood, predominantly oral condition that affects more than 1 million people in the United States. Burning mouth syndrome is a common disorder, usually affecting elderly females, characterised by intractable pain and burning in the oral cavity, evident especially in the tongue, together with a normal mouth mucosa. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity. Burning mouth syndrome is an idiopathic pain disorder, which appears to be neuropathic in origin. Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a burning sensation in the tongue or other oral sites, usually in the absence of clinical and laboratory findings. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a predominantly oral condition characterized by the occurrence of a chronic burning that commonly involves the anterior tongue, painful sensation, dryness and taste alterations. The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation of burning in the oral cavity, without clinical signs. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a disorder usually associated with an unexplained, prolonged sensation of burning inside the oral cavity. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome is a burning sensation or stinging disorder affecting the oral mucosa in the absence of any clinical signs or mucosal lesions. Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic pain condition characterized by burning, painful sensations within the oral cavity. BACKGROUND Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is common conditions that affects menopause women, patients suffer from sever burning sensation. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane often associated with symptoms such as subjective dryness of the mouth, paraesthesia and altered taste for which no medical or dental cause can be found. When a burning sensation in the mouth is caused by local or systemic factors, it is called secondary burning mouth syndrome and when these factors are treated the pain will resolve. Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by an intense burning or stinging sensation, preferably on the tongue or in other areas of mouth. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain or burning sensation affecting the oral mucosa, often unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other evident clinical signs. Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, which is used only after nutritional deficiencies, mucosal disease, fungal infections, hormonal disturbances and contact stomatitis have been ruled out. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disease characterized by burning of the oral mucosa associated with a sensation of dry mouth and/or taste alterations. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning sensations of the oral cavity in the absence of abnormalities of the oral mucosa. Burning mouth syndrome generally presents as a triad: Mouth pain, alteration in taste, and altered salivation, in the absence of visible mucosal lesions in the mouth. We analyzed the etiopathogenesis of Burning Mouth Syndrome and of the burning oral sensation and currently, we could not find a consensus on the diagnosis and classification of BMS. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is multifactorial in origin which is typically characterized by burning and painful sensation in an oral cavity demonstrating clinically normal mucosa. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, burning mouth Syndrome (BMS) is defined as a burning pain in the tongue or other oral mucous membrane in the absence of clinical signs or laboratory findings. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by the presence of burning sensation of the oral mucosa in the absence of clinically apparent mucosal alterations. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) refers to a chronic orofacial pain disorder usually unaccompanied by mucosal lesions or other clinical signs of organic disease. Burning mouth syndrome may present as an idiopathic condition (primary BMS type) distinct from the symptom of oral burning that can potentially arise from various local or systemic abnormalities (secondary BMS type), including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal changes associated with menopause, local oral infections, denture-related lesions, xerostomia, hypersensitivity reactions, medications, and systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus.	['Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), a chronic intraoral burning sensation or dysesthesia without clinically evident causes, is one of the most common medically unexplained oral symptoms/syndromes. It predominately affects middle-aged women in the postmenopausal period. The condition is distinguished by burning symptoms of the oral mucosa and the absence of any clinical signs.', 'Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral pain syndrome that primarily affects peri- and postmenopausal women. It is characterized by oral mucosal burning and may be associated with dysgeusia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and xerostomia.']
5710a51bcf1c325851000029	What is the function of the AtxA pleiotropic regulator?	The atxA gene product activates transcription of the anthrax toxin genes and is essential for virulence. The atxA-null mutant is avirulent in mice These data suggest that the atxA gene product also regulates toxin gene expression during infection. Thus, we conclude that the pX01 influence on capsule synthesis is mediated by AtxA, the pXO1-encoded trans-activator of the toxin gene expression. atxA, the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively  Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. Our data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.  Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved in regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA are important for optimal toxin gene expression. Two regulatory genes, acpA and atxA, have been reported to control expression of the Bacillus anthracis capsule biosynthesis operon capBCAD The atxA gene is located on the virulence plasmid pXO1, while pXO2 carries acpA and the cap genes Dual promoters control expression of the Bacillus anthracis virulence factor AtxA. Here we report that transcription of the atxA gene occurs from two independent promoters, P1 (previously described by Dai et al. [Z. Dai, J. C. Sirard, M. Mock, and T. M. Koehler, Mol. Microbiol. 16:1171-1181, 1995]) and P2, whose transcription start sites are separated by 650 bp. AtxA controls the expression of more than a hundred genes belonging to all genetic elements, the chromosome and both virulence plasmids, including those encoding the major virulence factors. AtxA can activate or repress gene expression.  Here we employ 5' and 3' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the atxA control region to demonstrate that atxA transcription from the major start site P1 is dependent upon a consensus sequence for the housekeeping sigma factor SigA and an A+T-rich upstream element for RNA polymerase. We also show that an additional trans-acting protein(s) binds specifically to atxA promoter sequences located between -13 and +36 relative to P1 and negatively impacts transcription. Deletion of this region increases promoter activity up to 15-fold. A majority of genes on the virulence plasmid pXO1 that are regulated by the presence of either CO2 or AtxA separately are also regulated synergistically in the presence of both. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanism The majority of the regulated genes responded to both AtxA and carbon dioxide rather than to just one of these factors. Interestingly, we identified two previously unrecognized small RNAs that are highly expressed under physiological carbon dioxide concentrations in an AtxA-dependent manner This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. As a similar organization is found in transcription regulators in many other pathogens, AtxA might become the paradigm of a new class of virulence regulators. AtxA, a Bacillus anthracis global virulence regulator. Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling. The accumulation of the global virulence regulator AtxA protein was strongly reduced in the mutant strain. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA.  Opposing effects of histidine phosphorylation regulate the AtxA virulence transcription factor in Bacillus anthracis. The B. anthracis pleiotropic regulator CodY activates toxin gene expression by post-translationally regulating the accumulation of the global regulator AtxA.  Cross-talk to the genes for Bacillus anthracis capsule synthesis by atxA, the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis. AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis.  Consistent with the role of atxA in virulence factor expression, a B. anthracis atxA-null mutant is avirulent in a murine model for anthrax.  This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. PlcR is the first example described of a pleiotropic regulator involved in the control of extracellular virulence factor expression in pathogenic Bacillus spp. Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling. AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis.	['AtxA is the gene encoding the trans-activator of anthrax toxin synthesis and is essential for virulence of B. anthracis.

The AtxA virulence regulator of Bacillus anthracis is required for toxin and capsule gene expression. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes.

56c2fbd91e69116444000001	What is the role of ELMO1 gene in cell migration?	Elmo1 helps dock180 to regulate Rac1 activity and cell migration of ovarian cancer Engulfment and cell motility 1 (Elmo1) has been reported to cooperate with dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180) and to be linked to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells through activating small G-protein Rac Engulfment and cell motility 1 presents with synergetic action in helping Dock180 to activate Rac1 and promote cell motility, and thus promote untoward expansion and aggressiveness of SOC. Elmo1 and Elmo2 are highly homologous cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that interact with Dock family guanine nucleotide exchange factors to promote activation of the small GTPase Rac This work provides valuable insights into the molecular regulation of Dock2 by Elmo1 that can be used to design improved inhibitors that target the Elmo-Dock-Rac signaling complex Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes Here we show that CXCL12 stimulation promotes interaction between Gαi2 and ELMO1. Gi signalling and ELMO1 are both required for CXCL12-mediated actin polymerization, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. CXCL12 triggers a Gαi2-dependent membrane translocation of ELMO1, which associates with Dock180 to activate small G-proteins Rac1 and Rac2. Our findings indicate that a chemokine-controlled pathway, consisting of Gαi2, ELMO1/Dock180, Rac1 and Rac2, regulates the actin cytoskeleton during breast cancer metastasis. These findings suggest that clearance of apoptotic cells in living vertebrates is accomplished by the combined actions of apoptotic cell migration and elmo1-dependent macrophage engulfment. Mechanistically, we identified Netrin-1 and its receptor Unc5B as upstream activators of the ELMO1/DOCK180 complex, regulating its functional interaction and leading to Rac1 activation in endothelial cells and vessel formation in zebrafish The ELMO1/DOCK180 complex forms a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, regulating its activation during cell migration in different biological systems. ELMO proteins are also known to regulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization through activation of the small GTPbinding protein Rac via the ELMO-Dock180 complex. Finally, in contrast to most other ERM-binding proteins, ELMO1 binding occurred independently of the state of radixin C-terminal phosphorylation, suggesting an ELMO1 interaction with both the active and inactive forms of ERM proteins and implying a possible role of ELMO in localizing or retaining ERM proteins in certain cellular sites. Together these data suggest that ELMO1-mediated cytoskeletal changes may be coordinated with ERM protein crosslinking activity during dynamic cellular functions. In mammalian fibroblasts, ELMO1 binds to Dock180, and functions upstream of Rac during phagocytosis and cell migration. We previously showed that ELMO1 binds directly to the Hck SH3 domain and is phosphorylated by Hck. The data suggest that Src family kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELMO1 might represent an important regulatory mechanism that controls signaling through the ELMO1/Crk/Dock180 pathway. We also found that ELMO1 regulated multiple Dock180 superfamily members to promote migration. This finding suggests that Rac activation by the ELMO.Dock180 complex at discrete intracellular locations mediated by the N-terminal 330 amino acids of ELMO1 rather than generalized Rac activation plays a role in cell migration In mammalian cells, ELMO1 interacts with Dock180 as a component of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac pathway responsible for phagocytosis and cell migration. The binding of ELMO1 to Hck is specifically dependent on the interaction of a polyproline motif with the SH3 domain of Hck. Our results suggest that these proteins may be novel activators/effectors of Hck. We also show that Hck and ELMO1 interact in intact cells and that ELMO1 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells that co-express Hck, suggesting that it is a substrate of Hck these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes Essential role of Elmo1 in Dock2-dependent lymphocyte migration. Dock180 and ELMO1 proteins cooperate to promote evolutionarily conserved Rac-dependent cell migration. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unknown, nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes.  nonredundant role for Elmo1 in controlling Dock2 levels and Dock2-dependent T cell migration in primary lymphocytes.

55391825bc4f83e828000016	What are the effects of homozygosity of EDNRB mutations in addition to Hirschsprung disease?	Homozygous mutations of EDNRB in human have been reported to result in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease (WS4), while mutated heterozygotes manifested isolated Hirschsprung disease in lower penetrance The index patient, who was born to a family with no history of Hirschsprung disease, presented total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel extension, sensorineural hearing loss and generalized cutaneous pigmentary defects. Interestingly, both irides were normally black. The study detected a homozygous missense mutation at codon 196 in exon 2 (Ser196Asn), which has not been reported. Both parents and four in six siblings harbored heterozygous mutation without any clinical manifestation. Our findings were consistent with previous observations that full spectrum of WS4 occurred to the mutate homozygotes. Moreover, the non-penetrance of heterozygotes in our pedigree, which differs from other reports, demonstrates the high pleiotropic effect of EDNRB mutations in human. Our own studies could show that, whereas a homozygous mutation of EDNRB causes long-segment HSCR, a heterozygous EDNRB deficiency leads to alterations of the ENS resembling the histopathology observed in intestinal neuronal dysplasia ABCD syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut (Hirschsprung disease [HSCR]), and deafness. This phenotype clearly overlaps with the features of the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, comprising sensorineural deafness; hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and irides; and HSCR. Therefore, we screened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for mutations in the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, a gene known to be involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 (R201X) of the EDNRB gene was found. We therefore suggest that ABCD syndrome is not a separate entity, but an expression of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene. RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association.

5a75eb6483b0d9ea66000004	What is Blount's disease?	Guided growth for tibia vara (Blount's disease). Blount's disease is commonly attributed to an intrinsic, idiopathic defect in the posteromedial proximal tibial physis resulting in progressive bowing of the leg, intoeing, and lateral knee thrust. Blount's disease is an uncommon disorder of postero-medial proximal tibial physis. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis.  Infantile Blount's disease is a condition that causes genu varum and internal tibial torsion. Blount's disease, or tibia vara, is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents.  In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount's Disease).  Late-onset tibia vara or Blount's disease is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents. PURPOSE: Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy is a useful option for correcting deformity associated with Blount's disease (tibia vara). INTRODUCTION: In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease. BACKGROUND: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities.  In 1937 Blount described a series of 28 patients with 'Tibia vara'. Since then, a number of deformities in the tibia and the femur have been described in association with this condition.  A LSG was done in a 10-year-old boy, body mass index (BMI) 42, who has Blount's disease (tibia vara) with severe pain at the knee joints that made him a wheelchair-bound person.  A review of the English literature on Blount disease (osteochondrosis deformans tibiae; tibia vara) revealed that two forms of the disease, infantile and adolescent, are recognized. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount disease can be defined as idiopathic proximal tibial vara. BACKGROUND Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount's disease or congenital tibia vara is a clinical entity characterized by tibia bowing, tibia torsion, and beaking of the medial tibia metaphysis on plain radiograph. In view of the spontaneous recovery of all investigated patients, it must be doubted whether a diagnosis of infantile tibia vara can be made in early infancy, and whether infantile Blount's disease is a diagnosis in its own right. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis. INTRODUCTION In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease. A family is described with infantile Blount's disease (tibia vara) following an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Biochemical observations in Blount's disease (infantile tibia vara).

During the past years, the advances in high-throughput technologies have produced an unprecedented growth in the number and size of repositories and databases storing relevant biological data. Today, there is more biological information than ever but, unfortunately, the current status of many of these repositories is far from being optimal. Some of the most common problems are that the information is spread out in many small databases; frequently there are different standards among repositories and some databases are no longer supported or they contain too specific and unconnected information. In addition, data size is increasingly becoming an obstacle when accessing or storing biological data.

PI3K-mTORC1 attenuates stress response by inhibiting cap-independent Hsp70 translation stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling Conversely, Hsp70 synthesis is enhanced under the reduced PI3K-mTORC1 signaling Our findings imply a plausible mechanism for how persistent PI3K-mTORC1 signaling favors the development of age-related pathologies by attenuating stress resistance One prominent example is the selective translation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) under stress conditions. Although the transcriptional regulation of Hsp genes has been well established, neither the specific translation-promoting features nor the regulatory mechanism of the translation machinery have been clearly defined. Here we show that the stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling.

54f48cb74e9bf3263f000001	What is known about type D personality trait in cancer patients?	RESULTS: Nineteen percent of patients (n=572) had a Type D personality. The perceived receipt of disease-specific (mean 46 vs. 51), medical test (56 vs. 63) and treatment information (37 vs. 42) was significantly lower for Type D patients compared with non-Type Ds as assessed with the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 (scales 0-100; all ps<0.01). Cancer patients with a Type D personality were less satisfied with the received information (49 vs. 58; p<0.01) and found the received information less useful (55 vs. 61; p<0.01) compared with non-Type Ds. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that Type D personality was independently associated with information about the disease (Beta=-0.09), medical tests (Beta=-0.12) and treatment (Beta=-0.08), and with satisfaction with information received (OR=0.54; 95%CI=0.44-0.66;all ps<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that patients with a Type D personality perceived that they received less information and reported less satisfaction with the amount of received information as compared with non-Type D patients. RESULTS: 750 (19%) patients had a Type D personality. They believe their illness has significantly more serious consequences, will last significantly longer, and experience significantly more symptoms that they attribute to their illness. Also, they are more concerned about their illness, and their disease more often influences them emotionally. Differences regarding 'consequences', 'concern' and 'emotional response' were also clinically relevant. Significant differences in perceptions on cause of disease between Type Ds and non-Type Ds were found for psychological distress (16.2 vs. 10.9%; p<0.01), randomness (1.7 vs. 5.3%; p<0.01) and unknown (18.8 vs. 24.4%; p<0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that Type D was negatively associated with 'coherence' and positively with 'consequences', 'timeline', 'identity', 'concern', and 'emotional representation'. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the associations between personality and illness perceptions, demonstrating their close interrelatedness. Our study may be helpful in further developing theoretical models regarding giving meaning to illness and the illness perceptions that the illness elicits. Future studies should investigate whether interventions can positively impact illness perceptions of Type D cancer patients. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of survivors had a type D personality. Over a 12-month period, type D survivors significantly more often reported osteoarthritis, back pain, and depression than non-type D survivors. Also, type D survivors more often reported to feel bothered by high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, heart disease, depression, diabetes and lung disease during daily activities. Type D survivors more often visited their general practitioner than non-type D survivors (P<.001), also in relation to cancer (0 visits: 54% vs. 60%; 1-5: 28% vs. 22%; >5: 9% vs. 5%; P<.001), as well as their specialist (0 visits: 6% vs. 7%; 1-5 visits: 59% vs. 64%; >5 visits: 30% vs. 23%; P<.01). CONCLUSION: Type D personality is a vulnerability factor that may help to identify subgroups of cancer survivors who are at an increased risk for comorbidity burden and increased health care utilization. Type D (distressed) personality is associated with poor quality of life and mental health among 3080 cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors with a Type D personality are at increased risk of impaired QoL and mental health problems that cannot be explained by socio-demographic or clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Patients with type D personality experienced higher physical and psychological distress than those with non-type D personality. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of survivors (n=125) were classified as Type D. They reported a clinically and statistically significant worse general health (57.8 versus 75.6), social functioning (73.1 versus 88.7), mental health (61.7 versus 80.6), more emotional role limitations (67.8 versus 89.4) and less vitality (54.5 versus 72.8) than non-Type D patients. Additionally, they reported a statistically and clinically relevant higher impact of cancer on body changes, negative self-evaluation, negative outlook on life, life interferences and health worry. Furthermore, they were more worried about the influence of the sun on their skin and acted accordingly. No differences were found in health care utilisation.

51753a948ed59a060a000029	What is the role of AMPK in diabetic cardiomyopathy?	We recently reported that diabetes depresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, inhibits MAPK8/JNK1-BCL2 signaling Activation of AMPK directly phosphorylates MAPK8, which mediates BCL2 phosphorylation and subsequent BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, leading to restoration of cardiac autophagy, protection against cardiac apoptosis, and ultimately improvement in cardiac structure and function. studies were shown that p38 MAPK stimulates glucose uptake through the AMPK activation. Taken together, it is suggested that the modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart. Genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. Oxidative stress and lipid deposition were markedly increased in the myocardium, concomitant with inactivation of AMPK and increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Trimetazidine also caused AMPK activation and reduced PGC-1 alpha expression in the hearts of db/db mice. The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. Activation of AMPK and decreased expression of PGC-1 alpha were involved in this process. Our findings highlight a role of PP2C and AMPK in the derangements of cardiac lipid metabolism in obesity and provide new insights as to the mechanisms of the liporegulatory disorder leading to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that dissociation of BCL2 from BECN1 through activation of MAPK8-BCL2 signaling may be an important mechanism by which AMPK activation restores autophagy, protects against cardiac apoptosis, and prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both the AMPK activator resveratrol and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine mimicked the UCF-101-induced beneficial effect in STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyocytes. UCF-101 protects against STZ-induced cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, possibly via an AMPK-associated mechanism.	['AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart.  Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin or trimetazidine administration may represent a novel approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.']
58c66a4b02b8c60953000025	Which are the main brain dysfunctions caused by hyperbilirubinemia?	Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and classical kernicterus are clinical manifestations of moderate to severe hyperbilirubinemia whenever bilirubin levels exceed the capacity of the brain defensive mechanisms in preventing its entrance and cytotoxicity. In such circumstances and depending on the associated co-morbidities, bilirubin accumulation may lead to short- or long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, which may include deficits in auditory, cognitive, and motor processing. Neuronal cell death, astrocytic reactivity, and microglia activation are part of the bilirubin-induced pathogenesis.  Reduced Myelination and Increased Glia Reactivity Resulting from Severe Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and kernicterus has been used to describe moderate to severe neurologic dysfunction observed in children exposed to excessive levels of total serum bilirubin (TSB) during the neonatal period. Histologic studies of brain tissue demonstrate that the onset of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by seizures, leads to alterations in myelination and glia reactivity.  Thus, kernicterus in this model displays not only axonal damage but also myelination deficits and glial activation in different brain regions that are usually related to the neurologic sequelae observed after severe hyperbilirubinemia. Advances in the care of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia have led to a decreased incidence of kernicterus. However, neonatal exposure to high levels of bilirubin continues to cause severe motor symptoms and cerebral palsy (CP). Exposure to moderate levels of unconjugated bilirubin may also cause damage to the developing central nervous system, specifically the basal ganglia and cerebellum.  High levels of serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in newborns are associated with axonal damage and glial reactivity that may contribute to subsequent neurologic injury and encephalopathy (kernicterus).  Hyperbilirubinemia remains one of the most frequent clinical diagnoses in the neonatal period. This condition may lead to the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in the central nervous system, causing nerve cell damage by molecular and cellular mechanisms that are still being clarified.  "Kernicterus" is a term currently used to describe bilirrubin induced brain injury in the neuro-pathological studies. This is a confusing term and nowadays we prefer bilirrubin encephalopathy or bilirrubin induced neurological dysfunction.  We then review the possible alteration of the neuroprotective and trophic barrier functions in the course of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunctions resulting from hyperbilirubinemia. It has been suggested recently that there is an association between hyperbilirubinemia and long-term neurologic dysfunctions. In this article, we review computational insights into the brain dysfunctions underlying Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and dystonia, with particular foci on dysfunctions of the dopamine system, basal ganglia pathways, and neuronal oscillations. Hyperbilirubinemia may accompany harmful effects such as jaundice, brain dysfunction, and pharmacokinetic alterations of drugs. Neonatal jaundice is a common cause of sensorneural hearing loss in children.We aimed to detect the neurotoxic effects of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia on brain stem and auditory tract by auditory brain stem evoked response (ABR) which could predict early effects of hyperbilirubinemia.This case-control study was performed on newborns with pathologic hyperbilirubinemia For example, the mean latencies time of wave I was significantly higher in right ear of the case group than in controls (2.16 ± 0.26 vs. 1.77 ± 0.15 milliseconds, respectively) (P &lt; 0.001).Pathologic hyperbilirubinemia causes acute disorder on brain stem function; therefore, early diagnosis of neonatal jaundice for prevention of bilirubin neurotoxic effects is essential Wave amplitudes are valuable BAER variables to detect functional impairment of the brainstem and auditory pathway in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and are recommended to be used in assessing bilirubin neurotoxicity to the neonatal brain.<CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2013 European Paediatric Neurology Society Histologic studies of brain tissue demonstrate that the onset of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by seizures, leads to alterations in myelination and glia reactivity [Characteristics of auditory brain stem response in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia induced by different causes]. Excessive hyperbilirubinemia in human neonates can cause permanent dysfunction of the auditory system, as assessed with brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs). A recent surge in reported cases of classical kernicterus, due in part to earlier hospital discharge and relaxation of treatment criteria for hyperbilirubinemia, and new reports of hyperbilirubinemia-induced auditory dysfunction using evoked potential based infant testing and hearing screening, underscore the need to better understand how hyperbilirubinemia causes brain damage in some infants, especially because the damage is preventable. Pathologic hyperbilirubinemia causes acute disorder on brain stem function; therefore, early diagnosis of neonatal jaundice for prevention of bilirubin neurotoxic effects is essential.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000009	What is known about the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring?	In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The outcome of one study suggested that children with autism were more likely to have a mother who was prescribed an SSRI during pregnancy. A history of maternal (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.08) but not paternal depression was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. In the subsample with available data on drugs, this association was confined to women reporting antidepressant use during pregnancy (3.34, 1.50 to 7.47, P=0.003), irrespective of whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors were reported. In utero exposure to both SSRIs and non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants) was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, particularly without intellectual disability. Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development, concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment, interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs, especially during the first trimester.  Among the potential environmental factors, hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues, hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs, and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy.  In adjusted logistic regression models, we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3]), with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-7.8]). Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low, results suggest that exposure, especially during the first trimester, may modestly increase the risk of ASD.  Together, these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.  Although several studies have not confirmed an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopment, a recent study observed an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in prenatally exposed offspring.  Considering the important role of serotonin in central nervous system development, more studies are needed to assess the possible adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopment.	['Greater risk for autism spectrum disorders has been reported among mothers that have used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. However, others did not find an association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring. Also, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy were associated with a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with autism spectrum disorders.']

SIE, most frequently pneumonia (IR 0.73/100 PY), were the most common serious AE, occurring more frequently in CZP compared to placebo-treated patients in RCT (IR 5.61/100 PY vs 1.35/100 PY, odds ratio (OR) 4.35, 95% CI 0.65 to 29.30). SIE rates were lower in the CZP-treated population including OLE (ER 4.33/100 PY). 44 patients developed tuberculosis (IR 0.47/100 PY), 39 from high endemic regions. 58 deaths occurred in CZP-exposed patients (IR 0.63/100 PY) and 70 developed malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (IR 0.76/100 PY), including five lymphomas (IR 0.05/100 PY). As well as displaying clinical efficacy, there is evidence to suggest that CZP has unique characteristics, including reduced transfer across the placenta and reduced frequency of injection site reactions. Furthermore, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CZP have demonstrated rapid improvements in workplace and home productivity in patients contributing to reducing the significant socioeconomic burden of RA. To assess the effectiveness and safety of certolizumab pegol (CDP870) in patients with RA who have not responded well to conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs  With an overall high grade of evidence this review revealed an improvement of clinical results (ACR50, 28 joint disease activity score (DAS-28) remission and HAQ scores) with certolizumab pegol. Adverse events were more frequent with certolizumab; there was a statistically significant increase in the number of serious adverse events, infections and hypertension. The clinical evidence was derived from two multicentre blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CZP + MTX to placebo + MTX (the RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 trials). RAPID 1 lasted 52 weeks with 982 patients and RAPID 2 24 weeks with 619 patients. Evidence for clinical effectiveness of CZP in mono-therapy came from the 24-week FAST4WARD trial with 220 patients that compared CZP (400 mg every 4 weeks) versus placebo. The three key RCTs demonstrated statistically significant superiority of CZP + MTX versus placebo + MTX and of CZP versus placebo with respect to a variety of outcomes including ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 measures and quality of life measures at 3 and 6 months. On the basis of results from the indirect comparison meta-analyses, the manufacturer suggested that CZP may be at least as effective as other 'biological' DMARD (bDMARD) comparators and, in a few ACR measures at 3 and 6 months, more effective. CZP is an effective therapy for adult RA patients whose disease has failed to respond adequately to cDMARDs including MTX or who are intolerant of MTX. The cost-effectiveness of CZP relative to other bDMARDs is unclear because the economic modelling undertaken may have ignored relevant effectiveness data and potential differences between trial populations, and so may have included effectiveness results that were biased in favour of CZP	['Improvement of clinical results (ACR50, 28 joint disease activity score (DAS-28) remission and HAQ scores) with certolizumab pegol.
