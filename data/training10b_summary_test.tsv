5159a306d24251bc050000a1	How does thyroid  hormone  regulate  SR-Ca2+ ATPase  (SERCA) protein in the heart?	Furthermore, using specific inhibitors of the TH-activated kinases, we show that the long-term effects of TH on the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and cell growth are reverted, implying that what is initiated as a non-genomic action of the hormone interfaces with genomic effects. Hypothyroid neonates showed increased cholesterol levels and decreased expression of D1 in liver and of Serca-2 in heart, which were normalized with T3 treatment. ERCA2 transcript and protein levels were reduced in FOG-2 transgenic hearts, and FOG-2 overexpression impaired T3-mediated SERCA2 expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. FOG-2 physically interacts with thyroid hormone receptor-alpha1 and abrogated even high levels of T3-mediated SERCA2 promoter activity. A marked elevation of the expression of beta-MHC and a reduced ratio of SERCA/Phospholamban were found in viable myocardium of AMI hearts, which was prevented by TH After TH treatment, AMI-THYR hearts expressed 71% alpha-MHC and 29% beta-MHC, P<0.05 versus SHAM and AMI and the ratio of SERCA/PLB was increased by 2.0-fold, P<0.05 versus SHAM and AMI. Because the binding of T(3) occupied receptors to the thyroid response elements in the SERCA promotor can increase gene expression These results demonstrate that increasing TR expression in the hypertrophied heart is associated with an improvement in contractile function and increased SERCA expression. Increased cardiac D2 activity led to elevated cardiac T3 levels and to enhanced myocardial contractility, accompanied by increased Ca(2+) transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) uptake. These phenotypic changes were associated with up-regulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) 2a expression Our results establish that elevated D2 activity in the heart increases T3 levels and enhances cardiac contractile function while preventing deterioration of cardiac function Hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), results in a similar effect. Dronedarone was given in Wistar rats (90 mg/kg, once daily (od) for 2 weeks) (DRON), while untreated animals served as controls (CONT). Hypothyroidism (HYPO) was induced by propylthiouracil administration. while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT. In HYPO, alpha-MHC and SERCA were decreased while beta-MHC was increased. the postnatal switch from beta- to alpha-myosin heavy chain (beta- and alpha-MHC, respectively) gene expression and the increase of SERCA-2a mRNA expression did not occur in the ventricular myocardium of either the transgenic (thyroid destroyed) or nontransgenic (intact thyroid) offspring of hypothyroid mothers In addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, dditionally, in T3-deprived samples alpha-sarcomeric actinin and SERCA-2 protein levels were reduced to 65.6 +/- 3% (P < 0.0001) and 74.1 +/- 4% (P=0.005), respectively, when compared with the T3-supplemented group. even mild chronic myocardial thyrotoxicosis, such as may occur in human hyperthyroidism, can cause tachycardia and associated changes in high energy phosphate compounds independent of an increase in SERCA II and alpha-MHC. Myocytes from banded hearts treated with T4 were hypertrophied but had increased concentrations of alpha-MHC and SERCA proteins Thyroid hormone (T3) increases the transcription of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) gene (SERCA 2) through three thyroid hormone response elements. MEF-2a in combination with either T3R alpha 1 or T3R beta 1 isoforms resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in SERCA 2 transgene expression in the absence of T3. Addition of T3 did not induce any further increase in SERCA 2 expression when T3R alpha 1 and MEF-2a expression vectors were cotransfected. In contrast, in the presence of T3R beta 1 and MEF-2, the addition of T3 increased chlorampenicol acetyltransferase activity by an additional 2.2-fold to a total 5.5-fold increase. Our findings point to T3R isoform-specific interactions with a cell type-specific transcription factor (MEF-2) in the regulation of SERCA 2 gene expression. These data are consistent with pretranslational and possibly transcriptional level effect of thyroid hormone on the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump gene (SERCA 2) These data demonstrate that T3 increases expression of the cardiac SR Ca2+ pump, that the effect can be localized to the cardiomyocyte, and that the effect is dependent on thyroid hormone receptors. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a transcriptional activator, affected the regulation of gene expression of MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase. The thyroid hormone responsiveness of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA has been previously established. The mRNA encoding the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase is highly influenced by thyroid hormone (T3) in the hearts of intact animals. Direct cellular effects of thyroid hormone have been implicated in modulating the expression of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes and the slow sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase (SR Ca(2+)-ATPase) gene.

53188c12b166e2b80600001a	What is the role of RhoA in bladder cancer?	Alterations in RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 expression play a significant role in the genesis and progression of UCC of the urinary bladder. Published reports suggest that elevated RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling plays a role in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure, ejaculation disorders, prostate and bladder cancer initiation, and eventual metastasis. The suppressive effect of Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, on oncogenic Ras/RhoA induced invasion/migration of human bladder cancer TSGH cells Our results provide evidence that Ras-induced RhoA and NF-kappaB activation was involved in the invasion/migration of bladder cancer. Increased RHOA expression was more common in grade 3 than in grade 2 tumors (P = 0.016). RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK were more abundant in tumors and metastatic lymph nodes than in nontumor bladder and uninvolved lymph nodes (P < 0.0001). High RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK expression were related to poor tumor differentiation (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively), muscle invasion (P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier plots linked high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression to shortened disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001). By univariate analysis, high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression predicted shortened disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001). Overall survival in tumors invading muscle (T2 to T4; 44 patients) was significantly influenced by RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.01, respectively).	['In urinary bladder cancer, RhoA was more commonly found to be activated in the later stages of the disease.

56c097deef6e394741000027	What is the role of photodynamic therapy for meningioma treatment?	CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of 5-ALA PDT could be increased by adjunction of ciprofloxacin in conventional clinical dosing and by prolongation of ALA incubation time.  CONCLUSION: Gefitinib can inhibit ABCG2-mediated PpIX efflux from malignant brain tumor cells to increase the intracellular PpIX and thereby enhance the PDT effect. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT was more effective in killing U-105MG glioma cells than CH-157MN meningioma cells. These data indicate unique features of AlPc which suggests its application as a potent, non-toxic photosensitizer in the photodynamic therapy of human meningiomas. Photodynamic therapy is being investigated as an adjuvant treatment for intracranial neoplasms.  It was found that PDT using haematoporphyrin derivative as a photosensitizing drug showed dose-dependent activity against a variety of histological subtypes of meningioma.  Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells.  Susceptibility to 5-aminolevulinic acid based photodynamic therapy in WHO I meningioma cells corresponds to ferrochelatase activity. We conclude that differences in intracellular PpIX concentrations between HBL-52 and BEN-MEN-1 benign meningioma cells were mainly due to differences in FECH activity and that these differences correspond to their susceptibility to 5-ALA-induced PDT.

Lentiviral treatment of patient-derived fibroblasts with the adapted U1 partially corrected aberrant splicing of endogenously expressed BBS1 transcripts. Our results show that the adaptation of U1 can correct pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations and suggest a high potential for gene therapy. Gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 snRNA to correct a RPGR splice defect in patient-derived cells. To correct the splice defect, we developed a gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 small nuclear RNA (U1) Full complementarity of U1 corrects the splice defect partially and increases recognition of the mutant SDS. The therapeutic effect is U1-concentration dependent as we show for endogenously expressed RPGR transcripts in patient-derived cells U1-based gene therapeutic approaches constitute promising technologies to treat SDS mutations in inherited diseases including X-linked RP. Correct mRNA processing at a mutant TT splice donor in FANCC ameliorates the clinical phenotype in patients and is enhanced by delivery of suppressor U1 snRNAs. use of lentiviral vectors as a delivery system to introduce expression cassettes for TT-adapted U1 snRNAs into primary FANCC patient fibroblasts allowed the correction of the DNA-damage-induced G2 cell-cycle arrest in these cells, thus representing an alternative transcript-targeting approach for genetic therapy of inherited splice-site mutations.

Although different causes of recurrent pericarditis have been identified, the etiology remains obscure in most cases which are therefore labelled as idiopathic. A poor response to colchicine treatment and/or a steroid-dependence may be the clue to investigate TNFRSF1A mutations in patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. intravenous infusion of inotropic agents medical treatment may be changed in these patients with a slower tapering of the dosage of steroidal and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The incidence of purulent pericarditis has decreased considerably since the antibiotic era. It is typically an acute and potentially lethal disease, necessitating rapid diagnosis and adequate therapy to improve prognosis. Standard treatment combines appropriate antibiotic therapy with surgical drainage.

Administration of debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a TRα1 antagonist abolished the T3-limiting effect on reperfusion injury: Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50%. In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased TRbeta 1 Hypothyroid heart displays a phenotype of cardioprotection against ischemia and this study investigated whether administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), dronedarone treatment results in cardioprotection by selectively mimicking hypothyroidism. The in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that dronedarone via its metabolite debutyldronedarone acts as a TRalpha(1)-selective inhibitor. Amiodarone resulted in increased T4, T4/T3 and rT3, whereas dronedarone did not alter the thyroid hormone profile in normal animals.

56f3eebd2ac5ed1459000016	How are CRM (cis-regulatory modules) defined?	Eukaryotic genes are often regulated by several transcription factors whose binding sites are tightly clustered and form cis-regulatory modules. In many species, especially higher eukaryotes, transcription factor binding sites tend to occur as homotypic or heterotypic clusters, also known as cis-regulatory modules This conserved sequence has therefore been proposed to act as a long-range, cis-acting regulator of limb-specific Shh expression.  The conserved upstream sequence can activate gene expression from basal promoters in the brain vesicle, although it requires additional cis-regulatory sequences to fully activate the CNS-specific gene expression. The genomic instructions used to regulate development are encoded within a set of functional DNA elements called cis-regulatory modules  Several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs).  However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are directly targeted by both. The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is a crucial step in studying gene expression, but the computational method attempting to distinguish CRMs from NCNRs still remains a challenging problem due to the limited knowledge of specific interactions involved. In eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation is usually mediated by interactions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) with their respective specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the so-called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in DNA. The transcriptional regulation of a metazoan gene depends on the cooperative action of multiple transcription factors that bind to cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) located in the neighborhood of the gene.

Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare incidental finding seen on endoscopy and has the characteristic appearance of flat, black-speckled pigmented mucosa. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a brownish speckled pigmentation in the duodenal bulb. Besides a Schatzki's ring the EGD revealed a duodenal mucosa with black-speckled pigmentation. Biopsies were performed and disclosed the deposition of brown (hemosiderin) pigment within macrophages in the lamina propria of normal villi. This endoscopic appearance is called pseudomelanosis duodeni (PD). Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare entity characterised by dark pigmented intracellular granules seen within macrophages that lie within the lamina propria of the duodenal villi. Pseudomelanosis duodeni (PD) is a rare dark speckled appearance of the duodenum associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure and consumption of different drugs. Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare, benign condition of unknown etiology. It is characterized by collection of pigment-laden macrophages in the tips of duodenal villi.  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is seen endoscopically as dark spots in the duodenal mucosa and is generally considered to be local deposition of iron from oral iron intake.

51542de6d24251bc0500007f	What is the role of the histidine rich calcium binding protein (HRC) in cardiomyopathy?	The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is a Ca-storage protein in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Recent transgenic studies revealed that this protein inhibits the maximal rates of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-transport, leading to cardiac dysfunction. In view of the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-cycling in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, we designed this study to gain further insight into the role of HRC during ischemia/reperfusion. Our findings suggest that increased cardiac HRC expression protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the heart, resulting in improved recovery of function and reduced infarction. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients The HRC(S96A) mutant exacerbated the inhibitory effects of HRC(WT) on the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients, prolongation of Ca(2+) decay time, and caffeine-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release. Consistent with these findings, HRC(S96A) reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC(WT). Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks, which was reduced by HRC(WT), was increased by mutant HRC(S96A) under resting conditions although there were no spontaneous Ca(2+) waves under stress conditions. However, expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic Ca(2+) transients. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.	['The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC), a 165 kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, regulates SR Ca cycling during excitation–contraction coupling.

5709f646cf1c325851000021	How can DUF families be deciphered?	 These families include proteins with domain of unknown function (DUF) DUF23, DUF246, and DUF266. The evidence for these proteins being GTs and their possible roles in cell wall biosynthesis is discussed. The genome projects have unearthed an enormous diversity of genes of unknown function that are still awaiting biological and biochemical characterization. These genes, as most others, can be grouped into families based on sequence similarity. The PFAM database currently contains over 2,200 such families, referred to as domains of unknown function (DUF) In a coordinated effort, the four large-scale centers of the NIH Protein Structure Initiative have determined the first three-dimensional structures for more than 250 of these DUF families. Critically examining domain covariation across metagenomic datasets can grant new perspectives on the roles and associations of DUFs in an ecological setting. Targeted attempts at DUF characterization in the laboratory or in silico may draw from these insights and opportunities to discover new associations and corroborate existing ones will arise as more large-scale metagenomic datasets emerge. Crystal structures of three members (BACOVA_00364 from Bacteroides ovatus, BACUNI_03039 from Bacteroides uniformis and BACEGG_00036 from Bacteroides eggerthii) of the Pfam domain of unknown function (DUF4488) were determined to 1.95, 1.66, and 1.81 Å resolutions, respectively Bacterial species in the Enterobacteriaceae typically contain multiple paralogues of a small domain of unknown function (DUF1471) from a family of conserved proteins also known as YhcN or BhsA/McbA. Proteins containing DUF1471 may have a single or three copies of this domain. Representatives of this family have been demonstrated to play roles in several cellular processes including stress response, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis. We have conducted NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies of four DUF1471 domains from Salmonella representing three different paralogous DUF1471 subfamilies: SrfN, YahO, and SssB/YdgH (two of its three DUF1471 domains: the N-terminal domain I (residues 21-91), and the C-terminal domain III (residues 244-314)). Notably, SrfN has been shown to have a role in intracellular infection by Salmonella Typhimurium Domain of unknown function (DUF) proteins represent a number of gene families that encode functionally uncharacterized proteins in eukaryotes. For example, DUF1618 family members in plants possess a 56-199-amino acid conserved domain and this family has not been described previously. Here, we report the characterization of 121 DUF1618 genes identified in the rice genome. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the rice DUF1618 family was divided into two major groups, each group consisting of two clades.  In this study we identified that a plant specific domain of unknown function, DUF581 is a zf-FCS type zinc finger.  DUF2233, a domain of unknown function (DUF), is present in many bacterial and several viral proteins and was also identified in the mammalian transmembrane glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase ("uncovering enzyme" (UCE)).

601ebc241cb411341a00005c	Explain the use of Radio Frequency Ablation as a treatment	Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) is a promising minimal-invasive treatment option for early liver cancer, however monitoring or predicting the size of the resulting tissue necrosis during the RFA-procedure is a challenging task, potentially resulting in a significant rate of under- or over treatments Endoscopy treatment includes a wide range of resection and ablative techniques, such as radio-frequency ablation (RFA), often concomitantly used in everyday endoscopy practice (multimodal therapy). RFA promotes mucosal necrosis of treated oesophagal region via high-frequency energy Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radio frequency ablation (RFA) in reducing clinical symptoms, fibroid volume and improving laboratory parameters.  Cooled radio frequency ablation (C-RFA) is a treatment with the potential to provide pain relief for patients who no longer benefit from noninvasive modalities and who desire an alternative to surgery. Peripheral nerve pain is common among patients with typical management including the use of pain medications, neuropathic agents, steroid injections, and nerve blocks. Additionally, the use of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be used in the management of chronic peripheral nerve pain. Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of RFA and PRF, typically case reports, have demonstrated that peripheral nerve RFA and PRF have the potential to provide relief of chronic pain for long duration Our study aimed at testing efficacy of RFA/PRF for treating peripheral neuralgia RFA and PRF can be used to treat chronic peripheral pain after conservative methods fail to do so. Large clinical trials are needed to confirm our finding. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an important standard therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, but direct monitoring of tissue treatment is currently lacking.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of sonographically guided radio frequency thermal ablation as a minimally invasive method for treatment of unresectable recurrent or metastatic tumors in the retroperitoneum and the pelvis, which often pose difficult surgical problems. SIONS: Minimally invasive sonographically guided radio frequency thermal ablation is technically feasible for local treatment of unresectable recurrent retroperitoneal and pelvic tumors from different origins. Care  PURPOSE: Radio frequency ablation is an emerging nephron sparing treatment option in select patients with small renal tumors. TERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 159 tumors treated with radio frequency ablation as primary treatment. D SIONS: Radio frequency ablation treatment success of the small renal mass is strongly correlated with tumor size. Radio PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a technique of MR-guided stereotactic radio frequency ablation, which was developed as a minimally invasive treatment for brain tumors, and to determine MR characteristics and sequential evolution of radio frequency lesions created to ablate brain tumors. Tumor ablation by using radio-frequency energy has begun to receive increased attention as an effective minimally invasive approach for the treatment of patients with a variety of primary and secondary malignant neoplasms radio-frequency ablation has been shown to be an effective method to treat BE, although there is disagreement as to whether radio-frequency ablation should be used to treat all patients with BE or whether treatment should be reserved for those at high risk for progressing to esophageal adenocarcinoma while continuing to endoscopically survey those with low risk. Recent res The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radio-frequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia adio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique which is used as standard local therapy of primary and metastatic liver tumors. T Minimally-invasive treatments of cardiac arrhythmias such as radio-frequency ablation are gradually gaining importance in clinical practice but still lack a noninvasive imaging modality which provides insight into the source or focus of an arrhythmia BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combining percutaneous plasma-mediated radio-frequency (pmRF) ablation with vertebral body augmentation offers an alternative treatment to surgical intervention options for advanced metastatic spinal lesions and is particularly useful for cases with cortical destruction and Recently, Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) is becoming a popular therapy for various cancers such as liver, breast, or lung cancer. RFA OBJECTIVE: Although radio-frequency ablation (RFA) has been recently applied as a minimally invasive treatment option for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), indication of this modality remains a critical issue due to the lack of complete tumor destruction as well as the uncertainty of its long-term efficacy. Recently, radio-frequency ablation has been shown to be an effective method to treat BE, although there is disagreement as to whether radio-frequency ablation should be used to treat all patients with BE or whether treatment should be reserved for those at high risk for progressing to esophageal adenocarcinoma while continuing to endoscopically survey those with low risk. The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radio-frequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia. SETTING: Teaching hospital.PATIENT(S): Women suffering from dysfunctional uterine bleeding.INTERVENTION(S): Bipolar radio frequency ablation and thermal balloon ablation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Patients were asked to complete HRQoL questionnaires at baseline, and at 2 days, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. METHODS: We reviewed our radio frequency ablation database of patients with renal masses undergoing laparoscopic or computerized tomography guided percutaneous radio frequency ablation with simultaneous peripheral fiberoptic thermometry from November 2001 to January 2011 at a single tertiary care center. Subanalysis of the 212 (67%) renal cell carcinoma tumors showed a 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of oncologic recurrence-free probability (post-ablation biopsy proven viable tumor) of 94% for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation and 100% for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation (p=0.16). They were organized into five categories: understanding the mechanisms and principles of radio-frequency ablation, modulation of tissue physiologic characteristics to increase tumor destruction, strategies of overlapping ablations, strategies to improve ablation according to tumor location, and imaging strategies after ablation to ensure adequate therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Radio frequency ablation treatment success of the small renal mass is strongly correlated with tumor size. Following surgical exposure of the kidney a single 12-minute radio frequency ablation of the tumor was performed using the Radionics Cool-tip RF Radio Frequency Ablation System (Radionics, Burlington, Massachusetts). Compared with the laparoscopic partial nephrectomy group, patients in the laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation group had a smaller decrease in glomerular filtration rate of the affected kidney at 3 months (10.2% vs 20.5%, p=0.001) and 12 months (7.6% vs 16.2%, p=0.002). This review aims to explain distinct effects of PPIs and RFA modalities, illuminate certain aspects of molecular mechanisms involved, as well as the effects of their concomitant use regarding the treatment of BE and prevention of its transfer to EAC.

PURPOSE: We defined the role of radio frequency ablation in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 patients with biopsy proven renal cell carcinoma were treated with radio frequency ablation in an outpatient setting and followed for a minimum of 4 years.RESULTS: Of the 16 patients 5 died before ence, pain relief was noted to occur very rapidly in 100% of cases. In agreement with the literature data, our results show that CT-guided percutaneous radio-frequency ablation can actually replace operative excision in the treatment of osteoid osteoma as it hanced T1-weighted images. The sequential MR imaging showed the radio frequency lesions decreased in volume in all cases, suggesting focal control.CONCLUSION: Stereotactic MR-guided radio frequency brain tumor ablation is a feasible and promising technique that can be an attrac These results suggest radio-frequency energy is a seductive alternative to direct current ablation for percutaneous modification of atrioventricular conduction in patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias.  89.7% (95% CI 78.5-97.9), respectively. The percent decrease in the glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the radio frequency ablation group at early and last followup.CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients with stage cT1b renal cell carcinoma radio frequency ablation is an effective treatment option that provides 5-year overall, cancer specific and disease-free survival comparable to that of partial nephrectomy as well as better OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of CT guided radio frequency ablation in the treatment of pelvis tumor.METHODS: 11 males and 8 females ranging from 25 to 49 years old (average 37) were enrolled in this study, all the 19 patients were suffering from pelvis tumor including giant cell tumor of bone (2/19), Ewing's sarcoma (2/19), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (3/19) and metastat In patients with metastatic disease, RF ablation may be suitable for treatment of a small tumor burden or for palliation of larger tumors that cause symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, or pain. In patients with non-small cell lung malignancy who are not candidates for surgery owing to poor cardiorespiratory reserve, RF ablation alone or followed by conventional radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy may prove to be a treatment option.

Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds sclerostin, has a dual effect on bone by increasing bone formation and reducing bone resorption, and thus has favorable effects in both aspects of bone volume regulation. Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin that binds to sclerostin, permitting the engagement of Wnt ligands with their co-receptors, resulting in an increase in bone formation and bone mineral density (BMD). Romosozumab (Romo), a humanized sclerostin antibody, is a bone-forming agent under development for treatment of osteoporosis. Treatment with sclerostin antibody (romosozumab) increases bone formation while reducing bone resorption, leading to increases in bone volume and bone mineral density.  Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to sclerostin, prevents sclerostin from exerting this inhibitory effect. Therefore, in the presence of romosozumab, the Wnt signaling pathway is activated leading to bone formation and bone mineral density gain. Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal sclerostin antibody under development for the treatment of osteoporosis, has a unique mechanism of action on bone-increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerosin antibody, and abaloparatide, a PTH-related peptide analog, are at present in advanced stages of clinical evaluation, so far demonstrating efficaciousness together with a favorable safety profile. Update on romosozumab : a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin. Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to sclerostin, prevents sclerostin from exerting this inhibitory effect. Romosozumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds and blocks the action of sclerostin, a protein secreted by the osteocyte and an extracellular inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin that binds to sclerostin, permitting the engagement of Wnt ligands with their co-receptors, resulting in an increase in bone formation and bone mineral density (BMD). EXPERT OPINION Blocking sclerostin action with romosozumab is a promising new therapeutic approach to osteoanabolic therapy of osteoporosis; efficacy and safety data on large controlled studies are awaited. AREAS COVERED Romosozumab is the first humanized monoclonal sclerostin antibody to be tested in clinical trials. Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerostin antibody, inhibits the action of sclerostin, a canonical Wnt signal inhibitor secreted from osteocytes, and enhances canonical Wnt signaling. A pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and dual elimination pathways was used to describe the kinetics of romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against sclerostin. Similar to preclinical animal studies with sclerostin antibodies, initial clinical studies show that romosozumab increases bone formation and bone mineral density.

589a246578275d0c4a00002e	Describe Wellens' Syndrome.	NTRODUCTION: Wellens Syndrome (WS) is a condition characterized by typical changes in ECG, which are biphasic T-wave inversions (less common) or symmetric and deeply inverted T waves (including 75%) in lead V2-V3 chest derivations.  BACKGROUND: Reperfusion after coronary occlusion (myocardial infarction, MI), as in Wellens' syndrome, is often represented on ECG as T-wave inversion in the leads overlying the affected myocardial wall(s).  Her presentation was concerning for acute coronary syndrome, Wellens syndrome in particular, given the elevated troponin levels, lack of ST segment changes, and characteristic T-wave findings.  Omnious T-wave inversions: Wellens' syndrome revisited. Wellens' syndrome is characterized by T-wave changes in electrocardiogram (EKG) during pain-free period in a patient with intermittent angina chest pain.  We describe a case of a 42-year-old man, with a previous episode of angina and a normal ECG and serum cardiac markers, and a two months later finding of biphasic T wave in leads V2-V3 and deeply inverted T wave in V4-V5 at a asymptomatic occupational evaluation. This is a typical ECG pattern of Wellens' syndrome. Whereas the Wellens' syndrome is characterized by symmetrically inverted T-waves with preserved R waves in the precordial leads suggestive of impending myocardial infarction due to a critical proximal left anterior descending stenosis, the pseudo-Wellens' syndrome caused by coronary artery spasm has also rarely been reported in literature. The Wellens electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of dynamic T-wave inversion in the anterior leads is observed in clinical conditions characterized by reversible left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (stunned myocardium), either ischemic or nonischemic Wellens Syndrome (WS) is a condition characterized by typical changes in ECG, which are biphasic T-wave inversions (less common) or symmetric and deeply inverted T waves (including 75%) in lead V2-V3 chest derivations. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed biphasic T-waves in V2-V4, which was recognized as Wellens' syndrome, or acute coronary T-wave syndrome.

5309fa5e970c65fa6b000003	What is the mode of action of Hsp90 inhibitors?	In vitro, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 by IPI-504 exerts antiproliferative effects in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In pancreatic cancer xenografts obtained directly from patients with pancreas cancer, the agent resulted in a marked suppression of tumor growth. Using a proteomic profiling analysis with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling technique, we have identified 20 down-regulated proteins and 42 up-regulated proteins on IPI-504 treatment.tumor growth Identical changes were observed in the expression of the genes coding for these proteins in a subset of proteins including HSPA1B, LGALS3, CALM1, FAM84B, FDPS, GOLPH2, HBA1, HIST1H1C, HLA-B, and MARCKS. The majority of these proteins belong to the functional class of intracellular signal transduction, immune response, cell growth and maintenance, transport, and metabolism. Dicoumarol, a long-established oral anticoagulant, is a new Hsp90 inhibitor that represses PTTG1/Securin gene expression and provokes apoptosis through a complex trait involving both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Dicoumarol activity as an Hsp90 inhibitor is confirmed by smaller levels of Hsp90 clients in treated cells and inhibition of in vivo heat shock luciferase activity recovery assays. Likewise, established Hsp90 inhibitors (17-allylamino-geldanamycin and novobiocin) repress PTTG1/Securin gene expression.  However, effects on PTTG1/Securin could be partially ascribed to inhibition of the Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. To document this field, we have studied two Hsp90 inhibitors (radicicol and geldanamycin), known to interact with the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 (the Bergerat fold), One of these is the novel agent 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin that acts to inhibit the hsp90 molecular chaperone. Treatment of four human colon cancer cell lines with iso-effective concentrations of this agent resulted in depletion of c-raf-1 and akt and inhibition of signal transduction. The expression of hsp90 client protein genes was not affected, but hsc hsp70, hsp90beta, keratin 8, keratin 18 and caveolin-1 were deregulated following treatment.	['Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 involves interaction with the ATP-binding site of the chaperone. This exerts antiproliferative effects resulting in a marked suppression of tumor growth.

601d72a31cb411341a000037	Describe efforts on Sarcoma from the 100,000 Genomes Project	The largest whole genome sequencing (WGS) endeavour involving cancer and rare diseases was initiated in the UK in 2015 and ran for 5 years. Despite its rarity, sarcoma ranked third overall among the number of patients' samples sent for sequencing. Herein, we recount the lessons learned by a specialist sarcoma centre that recruited close to 1000 patients to the project, so that we and others may learn from our experience. WGS data was generated from 597 patients, but samples from the remaining approximately 400 patients were not sequenced. This was largely accounted for by unsuitability due to extensive necrosis, secondary to neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or being placed in formalin. The number of informative genomes produced was reduced further by a PCR amplification step. We showed that this loss of genomic data could be mitigated by sequencing whole genomes from needle core biopsies. Storage of resection specimens at 4 °C for up to 96 h overcame the challenge of freezing tissue out of hours including weekends. Removing access to formalin increased compliance to these storage arrangements. With over 70 different sarcoma subtypes described, WGS was a useful tool for refining diagnoses and identifying novel alterations. Genomes from 350 of the cohort of 597 patients were analysed in this study. Overall, diagnoses were modified for 3% of patients following review of the WGS findings. Continued refinement of the variant-calling bioinformatic pipelines is required as not all alterations were identified when validated against histology and standard of care diagnostic tests. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of germline mutations in patients with sarcoma, and sarcomas with evidence of hypermutation. Despite 50% of the WGS exhibiting domain 1 alterations, the number of patients with sarcoma who were eligible for clinical trials remains small, highlighting the need to revaluate clinical trial design.

55479102f35db75526000004	What heterotachy states about molecular evolutionary processes?	One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. Heterotachy is a general term to describe positions that evolve at different rates in different lineages. There is widespread evidence of lineage-specific rate variation, known as heterotachy, during protein evolution. Changes in the structural and functional constraints acting on a protein can lead to heterotachy Variation in substitution rates among evolutionary lineages (among-lineage rate variation or ALRV) has been reported to negatively affect the estimation of phylogenies. When the substitution processes underlying ALRV are modeled inadequately, non-sister taxa with similar substitution rates are estimated incorrectly as sister species due to long-branch attraction. Recent advances in modeling site-specific rate variation (heterotachy) have reduced the impacts of ALRV on phylogeny estimation in several empirical and simulated datasets. Heterotachy, the variation of substitution rate at a site across time, is a prevalent phenomenon in nucleotide and amino acid alignments, which may mislead probabilistic-based phylogenetic inferences. Heterotachy is a general term to describe positions in a sequence that evolve at different rates in different lineages. homotachy (i.e., the evolutionary rates within lineages in each of the concatenated genes are constant during evolution). Here, we examine how the violation of homotachy (i.e., presence of within-site rate variation, called heterotachy) distorts species phylogenies. The rate at which a given site in a gene sequence alignment evolves over time may vary. This phenomenon--known as heterotachy--can bias or distort phylogenetic trees inferred from models of sequence evolution that assume rates of evolution are constant. The evolutionary rate at a given homologous position varies across time. When sufficiently pronounced, this phenomenon - called heterotachy - may produce artefactual phylogenetic reconstructions under the commonly used models of sequence evolution. Rate-across-site (RAS) models are commonly used evolutionary models in phylogenetic studies. These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). The rate of evolution varies spatially along genomes and temporally in time. The presence of evolutionary rate variation is an informative signal that often marks functional regions of genomes and historical selection events. There exist many tests for temporal rate variation, or heterotachy heterotachy, a phenomenon that corresponds to shifts in site-specific evolutionary rates over time. within-site rate variation (heterotachy) Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Gamma distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for "different speed" in Greek). Heterotachy occurs when the relative evolutionary rates among sites are not the same across lineages. Sequence alignments are likely to exhibit heterotachy with varying severity because the intensity of purifying selection and adaptive forces at a given amino acid or DNA sequence position is unlikely to be the same in different species. compare the evolutionary properties of homologous sequence positions in paralogs. It has been proposed that the positions that show switches in substitution rate over time--i.e., 'heterotachous sites'--are good indicators of functional divergence. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy. These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). However, recent work by Kolaczkowski and Thornton suggested, on the basis of simulations, that MP is less sensitive than ML to tree reconstruction artefacts generated by heterotachy, a phenomenon that corresponds to shifts in site-specific evolutionary rates over time. Evolutionary rates vary among sites and across the phylogenetic tree (heterotachy). The principle of heterotachy states that the substitution rate of sites in a gene can change through time. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy." Here we examine the accuracy of 2 phylogenetic methods for incorporating heterotachy, the mixed branch length model--which incorporates site-specific rate changes by summing likelihoods over multiple sets of branch lengths on the same tree--and the covarion model, which uses a hidden Markov process to allow sites to switch between variable and invariable as they evolve.

54dc8ed6c0bb8dce23000002	What is known as Calcium Induced Calcium Release (CICR) and its role in cardiomyocyte contractility?	Cardiomyocyte contraction depends on rapid changes in intracellular Ca(2+). In mammals, Ca(2+) influx as L-type Ca(2+) current (ICa) triggers the release of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is critical for excitation-contraction coupling. Release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) induced by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal L-type Ca(2+) channels (CICR) in cardiac muscle cells has been implicated as a potential target contributing to anesthetic-induced myocardial depression.  It is well known that calcium-induced calcium-release in cardiac myocytes takes place in spatially restricted regions known as dyads, where discrete patches of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum tightly associate with the t-tubule membrane.  Calcium (Ca(2+))-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is widely accepted as the principal mechanism linking electrical excitation and mechanical contraction in cardiac cells. The CICR mechanism has been understood mainly based on binding of cytosolic Ca(2+) with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inducing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Waves of calcium-induced calcium release occur in a variety of cell types and have been implicated in the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.  Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) has been observed in cardiac myocytes as elementary calcium release events (calcium sparks) associated with the opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. In heart cells, a tight coupling between the gating of single L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) underlies calcium release.

515a9d86d24251bc050000a7	Albumin depletion is a common first step for proteomic analysis of CSF fluid. What is the advantage and disadvantage of this procedure?	However, albumin binds peptides and proteins, which raises concerns as to how the removal of albumin could impact the outcome of the biomarker study while ignoring the possibility that this could be a biomarker subproteome itself. This study demonstrates that reduction of sample complexity by albumin depletion of CSF can be performed without CV impairment. We have utilized albumin depletion prior to 2D gel electrophoresis to enhance glycoprotein concentration for image analysis as well as structural glycoprotein determination without glycan release using mass spectrometry (MS). The albumin depletion method is the most suitable as prefractionation method of CSF prior to 2-DE for structural determination of glycoproteins in the study of neurodegenerative disorders. A proper sample preparation, in particular, abundant protein removal is crucial in the characterization of low-abundance proteins including those harboring post-translational modifications. In human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), approximately 80% of proteins originate from serum, and removal of major proteins is necessary to study brain-derived proteins that are present at low concentrations for successful biomarker and therapeutic target discoveries for neurological disorders. The most abundant component in human body fluids, human serum albumin (HSA), is present at concentrations corresponding to approximately 50% of the total protein content in, e.g., plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If this component could be selectively removed, then the chances of observing lower-abundance component of clinical interest would be greatly improved. , and the identification of lower abundant components was clearly facilitated. Two different depletion strategies for removing albumin from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Microcon Centrifugal Filter vs. Montage Albumin Deplete kit, were evaluated for improving protein profiling pattern and reproducibility in SELDI analysis. METHODS: Pooled CSF was divided into 20 aliquots and these aliquots were subjected to SELDI analysis ei Enhanced identification of lower-abundance components was observed in the depleted fraction, in terms of more detected peptides per protein.	['Depletion of the high abundant protein Albumin from CSF samples is improving the detection of lower abundant proteins but may also lead to the potential loss of non-target proteins.']

5cf619a8a49efeb44c000010	What is the function of the Spt6 gene in yeast?	Spt6 is a highly conserved histone chaperone that interacts directly with both RNA polymerase II and histones to regulate gene expression. Spt6 is a highly conserved factor required for normal transcription and chromatin structure.  Binding of elongation factor Spt6 to Iws1 provides an effective means for coupling eukaryotic mRNA synthesis, chromatin remodelling and mRNA export.  Spt6 Is Essential for rRNA Synthesis by RNA Polymerase I. Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. These effects are mediated through interactions with histones, transcription factors, and the RNA polymerase. Two lines of evidence suggest that Spt6 also plays a role in rRNA synthesis. We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression.

52f125332059c6d71c000007	What is the mode of action of everolimus?	Target-of-Rapamycin Inhibitors (Sirolimus, Everolimus), Although the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is effective for the treatment of patients who have failed TKI therapy, it is important to consider all available treatment options before switching therapy mode of action. The mTOR pathway, and its upstream regulators in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT cascade, are altered in a variety of experimental and human malignancies.This has led to the prediction that mTOR inhibitors may be used as anticancer agents. With the recent approval of two mTOR-targeted drugs (temsirolimus and everolimus) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma, this paradigm has been effectively translated into the clinical setting. mTOR inhibitors such as Temsirolimus (CCI779) and Everolimus (RAD001) are effective for suppressing cell growth with inhibiting mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin and its related analogs such as Temsirolimus and Everolimus are less toxic for humans compared with other anti-VEGFR inhibitors and has been used as an immunosuppressive agent. These agents have an inhibitory activity against the mTORC1 complex. mTOR inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus. The introduction of the inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols substantially. Octreotide and the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) block proliferation and interact with the Akt-mTOR-p70S6K pathway RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel agent that is being trialled in the treatment of neuro-endocrine tumours, and is known to interact with mTOR. In this cell model, octreotide and RAD001 appear to act through a similar pathway and inhibit the Akt-mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway downstream of Akt. Target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) Target of rapamycin inhibitors (TOR-I; sirolimus and everolimus) Target of rapamycin inhibitors (TOR-I) (sirolimus, everolimus) are immunosuppressive agents with a novel mode of action These three classes are tyrosine kinase inhibitors with sunitinib and sorafenib, the anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab which is associated with alpha interferon in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer) and mTOR inhibitors with temsirolimus and everolimus.

554403395beec11c10000001	Which is the primary distinction between the Reverse Warburg effect and the conventional Warburg effect?	The metabolic energy transduction pathways are strongly affected in cancers. Mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells (Warburg effect) or in fibroblasts associated with cancer cells (reverse Warburg effect) results in decreased or increased power of the generated electromagnetic field, respectively cigarette smoke induces catabolism in the local microenvironment, directly fueling oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in neighboring epithelial cancer cells, actively promoting anabolic tumor growth. our current findings are consistent with the idea that cigarette smoke induces the "reverse Warburg effect," thereby fueling "two-compartment tumor metabolism" and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells. We have recently proposed a new two-compartment model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism. In this model, glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate and ketone bodies) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells, driving OXPHOS and mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells. Consistent with the "reverse Warburg effect," our results indicate that metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) and that adjacent stromal cells are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. "glycolytic" cancer cells were rarely observed, indicating that the conventional "Warburg effect" does not frequently occur in cancer-positive lymph node metastases. We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. This, in turn, drives L-lactate secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in epithelial cancer cells, by acting as a paracrine onco-metabolite. We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the "Reverse Warburg Effect," as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer cells. the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer We have previously demonstrated that enhanced aerobic glycolysis and/or autophagy in the tumor stroma supports epithelial cancer cell growth and aggressive behavior, via the secretion of high-energy metabolites. These nutrients include lactate and ketones, as well as chemical building blocks, such as amino acids (glutamine) and nucleotides. Lactate and ketones serve as fuel for cancer cell oxidative metabolism, and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. We have termed these novel concepts the "Reverse Warburg Effect," and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism. Previously, we proposed that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, as they use targeted oxidative stress as a "weapon" to extract recycled nutrients from adjacent stromal cells. Oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts triggers autophagy and  mitophagy, resulting in compartmentalized cellular catabolism, loss of mitochondrial function, and the onset of aerobic glycolysis, in the tumor stroma. As such, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce high-energy nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) that fuel mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism in cancer cells. We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism the "reverse Warburg effect." Recently, we proposed a new mechanism for understanding the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism. In this new paradigm, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, and extrude lactate to "feed" adjacent cancer cells, which then drives mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Thus, there is vectorial transport of energy-rich substrates from the fibroblastic tumor stroma to anabolic cancer cells.  the "reverse Warburg effect," which states that cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate, which is utilized as a metabolic substrate by adjacent cancer cells. In this model, "energy transfer" or "metabolic-coupling" between the tumor stroma and epithelial cancer cells "fuels" tumor growth and metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in anabolic cancer cells. the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria.  stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism", or the "Reverse Warburg Effect". Our findings are consistent with the recently proposed "Reverse Warburg Effect" and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism." In these two complementary models, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal cells, which then forces these stromal fibroblasts to undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis. This, in turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones and glutamine) to feed anabolic cancer cells, which are undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis and the resulting energy-rich metabolites are then transferred to epithelial cancer cells, where they enter the TCA cycle, resulting in high ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. We have termed this new paradigm "The Reverse Warburg Effect." Previously, we proposed a new model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this model, the stromal fibroblasts would undergo aerobic glycolysis (a.k.a., the Warburg effect)--producing and secreting increased pyruvate/lactate that could then be used by adjacent epithelial cancer cells as "fuel" for the mitochondrial TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. In this alternative model of tumorigenesis, the epithelial cancer cells instruct the normal stroma to transform into a wound-healing stroma, providing the necessary energy-rich micro-environment for facilitating tumor growth and angiogenesis. In essence, the fibroblastic tumor stroma would directly feed the epithelial cancer cells, in a type of host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new idea the "Reverse Warburg Effect." In this scenario, the epithelial tumor cells "corrupt" the normal stroma, turning it into a factory for the production of energy-rich metabolites. Warburg's original observation that tumors show a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. The reverse Warburg effect: aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts and the tumor stroma. We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells. Thus, we conclude that ketones and lactate fuel tumor growth and metastasis, providing functional evidence to support the "Reverse Warburg Effect". We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells	['The conventional "Warburg effect" reffers to  the metabolic shift of cancer cells towards aerobic glycolysis, due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The "reverse Warburg effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer, is a model of "two-compartment tumor metabolism". In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. The cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. These glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketone bodies and chemical building blocks, such as amino acids -glutamine-, and nucleotides) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells. Lactate and ketones drive cancer cell  oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Therefore, according to the "reverse Warburg effect", stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. Thus, in "reverse Warburg effect" the cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than epithelial cancer cells themselves, as proposed by the conventional "Warburg effect".']

5ab8fb5bfcf4565872000017	How is the nuclear localization of lncRNA mediated?	As many lncRNAs regulate nuclear events and thus must localize to nuclei, we analyzed the sequence requirements for nuclear localization in an intergenic lncRNA named BORG (BMP2-OP1-responsive gene), which is both spliced and polyadenylated but is strictly localized in nuclei. Subcellular localization of BORG was not dependent on the context or level of its expression or decay but rather depended on the sequence of the mature, spliced transcript. Mutational analyses indicated that nuclear localization of BORG was mediated through a novel RNA motif consisting of the pentamer sequence AGCCC with sequence restrictions at positions -8 (T or A) and -3 (G or C) relative to the first nucleotide of the pentamer.  A novel RNA motif mediates the strict nuclear localization of a long noncoding RNA.	['The lncRNA localization to the nucleus can be mediated by the pentamer sequence AGCCC.']

Absence or severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to bilirubin accumulation in the body resulting in yellow skin and eyes (jaundice).   jaundice refers to yellow coloration of the skin and the sclera (whites of the eyes) of newborn babies that result from the accumulation of bilirubin in the skin and mucous membranes. however, are hindered by the relatively limited knowledge about the impact of different amounts of extravascular bilirubin on skin spectral responses and on the onset of jaundice, the resulting yellow-tinted skin appearance.  Febrile jaundice results clinically in generalized yellow coloration of the teguments and mucous membranes due to excess plasma bilirubin, accompanied by fever.  Jaundice is a yellowish pigmentation of skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia, which itself has various causes.  signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL. In all Jaundice is a clinical manifestation of disorders of underlying bilirubin metabolism, hepatocellular dysfunction, or biliary obstruction.  Jaundice is a clinical manifestation of disorders of underlying bilirubin metabolism, hepatocellular dysfunction, or biliary obstruction. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/ Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. The most common causes of jaundice were drug-induced hepatitis, occurring in 11 patients (31 percent), and alcoholic liver disease, occurring in 5 (13 percent). Jaundice is one of the notable markers of liver malfunction in our body, revealing a significant rise in the concentration of an endogenous yellow pigment bilirubin. Clinical signs of jaundice occur when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3 mg/dL. This destruction has two consequences: leaking ALT and AST liver enzymes which increases during the course of disease and accumulation of bilirubin- a red pigmented compound released from dead red cells- which causes the yellow coloration of eyes and skin.

The objective of the international Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) is to map and annotate all proteins encoded by the genes on each human chromosome. The C-HPP consortium was established to organize a collaborative network among the research teams responsible for protein mapping of individual chromosomes and to identify compelling biological and genetic mechanisms influencing colocated genes and their protein products. The C-HPP aims to foster the development of proteome analysis and integration of the findings from related molecular -omics technology platforms through collaborations among universities, industries, and private research groups. The goal of the Human Proteome Project (HPP) is to fully characterize the 21,000 human protein-coding genes with respect to the estimated two million proteins they encode. As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment. The Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) aims to define all proteins encoded in each chromosome and especially to identify proteins that currently lack evidence by mass spectrometry. Our results will contribute to the accomplishment of the primary goal of the C-HPP in identifying so-called "missing proteins" and generating a whole protein catalog for each chromosome. there is only little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular localization, interactions, or cellular functions. The aim of the HUPO Human Proteome Project (HPP, www.thehpp.org ) is to collect this information for every human protein. . To support the efforts of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project Consortium, we have annotated these proteins with their respective chromosome location. One of the major challenges of a chromosome-centric proteome project is to explore in a systematic manner the potential proteins identified from the chromosomal genome sequence, but not yet characterized on a protein level. The Chromosome 16 Consortium forms part of the Human Proteome Project that aims to develop an entire map of the proteins encoded by the human genome following a chromosome-centric strategy (C-HPP) to make progress in the understanding of human biology in health and disease (B/D-HPP).

Compared with control group, [Ca(2+)](i) and the expression of CaSR, RyR and SERCA/PLN were decreased, while PKC-α and PLN were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in diabetic group Diabetic rats showed impaired cardiac structure and function compared with control rats. The expression of PKC, PLB increased significantly, while the PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR expression decreased. Treatment with breviscapine could reverse the cardiac dysfunction and structure changes in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats, and decrease the expression of PKC and PLB, as well as increase the expression of PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR. Diabetic Ren-2 rats developed impairment of both active and passive phases of diastole, accompanied by reductions in SERCA-2a ATPase and phospholamban along with activation of the fetal gene program. The levels of SERCA and GLUT4, but not PLB, were significantly reduced in diabetic hearts compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: CASQ2, FKBP12.6 and SERCA2a were down-regulated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Reduced sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase (SERCA2a) expression has been shown to play a significant role in the cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and Ca(2+)-release channels (ryanodine receptor RyR2) are involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy, however, the implication of intracellular calcium handling proteins in SR is undefined. The depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) and Ca2+-release channels (ryanodine receptor RyR2) are involved in the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Slowed relaxation in diabetic cardiomyopathy (CM) is partially related to diminished expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2a.

CARMEN exhibits RNA-dependent enhancing activity and is upstream of the cardiac mesoderm-specifying gene regulatory network. Interestingly, CARMEN interacts with SUZ12 and EZH2, two components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We demonstrate that CARMEN knockdown inhibits cardiac specification and differentiation in cardiac precursor cells independently of MIR-143 and -145 expression, two microRNAs located proximal to the enhancer sequences. Importantly, CARMEN expression was activated during pathological remodeling in the mouse and human hearts, and was necessary for maintaining cardiac identity in differentiated cardiomyocytes.

The effects of both ATX-II and the N(1325)S mutation were reversed by either I(NaL) inhibition (with ranolazine or tetrodotoxin) or CaMKII inhibition (with KN93 or autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide). Such changes were related to enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity and increased phosphorylation of its targets. Ranolazine at therapeutic concentrations partially reversed the HCM-related cellular abnormalities via I(NaL) inhibition, with negligible effects in controls. By shortening the action potential duration in HCM cardiomyocytes, ranolazine reduced the occurrence of early and delayed afterdepolarizations. Finally, as a result of the faster kinetics of Ca(2+)(i) transients and the lower diastolic Ca(2+)(i), ranolazine accelerated the contraction-relaxation cycle of HCM trabeculae, ameliorating diastolic function.

Oclacitinib inhibited JAK family members by 50% at concentrations (IC50 's) ranging from 10 to 99 nm and did not inhibit a panel of 38 non-JAK kinases (IC50 's>1000 nM). Oclacitinib was most potent at inhibiting JAK1 (IC50 = 10 nM). Oclacitinib also inhibited the function of JAK1-dependent cytokines involved in allergy and inflammation (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13) as well as pruritus (IL-31) at IC50 's ranging from 36 to 249 nM.

The meta-analyses yielded significantly increased risks for all CNS tumors, glioma and meningioma in users of estrogen-only [1.35 (1.22-1.49), 1.23 (1.06-1.42) and 1.31 (1.20-1.43), respectively] but not estrogen-progestin HT [1.09 (0.99-1.19), 0.92 (0.78-1.08) and 1.05 (0.95-1.16), respectively]; these differences were statistically significant (p<0.005 for each tumor type). There was no significant difference between glioma and meningioma risk in users of estrogen-only HT. The totality of the available evidence suggests an increased risk of all CNS tumors (and of glioma and meningioma separately) in users of estrogen-only HT.  Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67).  The relationship between current use of exogenous hormones and meningioma remains unclear, limited by the small numbers of patients currently on oral hormone medications and a lack of hormone receptor data for meningioma tumors. Ever use of estradiol-only therapy was associated with an increased risk of meningioma (standardized incidence ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.44). Among women who had been using estradiol-only therapy for at least 3 years, the incidence of meningioma was 1.40-fold higher (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.64; P<0.001) than in the background population.  Estradiol-only therapy was accompanied with a slightly increased risk of meningioma. Results from several prospective, large-scale studies indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy may increase the risk for diagnosing meningioma by 30-80%, but there is no effect in regard to glioma.  A retrospective study including more than 350,000 women, about 1400 of whom had developed meningioma, showed that the risk of meningioma was about twice as high in users of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy as in non-users. Compared with never users of HRT, the relative risks (RRs) for all incident CNS tumours, gliomas, meningiomas and acoustic neuromas in current users of HRT were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05-1.36), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.89-1.32), 1.34 (95% CI: 1.03-1.75) and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.02-2.45), respectively, and there was no significant difference in the relative risks by tumour type (heterogeneity p = 0.2).  BACKGROUND: Previous studies on association of exogenous female sex hormones and risk for meningioma have yielded conflicting results. RESULTS: Postmenopausal hormonal treatment, use of contraceptives, or fertility treatment did not influence the risk of meningioma.  CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little indication that reproductive factors or use of exogenous sex hormones affect meningioma risk. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.  BACKGROUND: The role of exogenous hormone exposures in the development of meningioma is unclear, but these exposures have been proposed as one hypothesis to explain the over-abundance of such tumors in women. RESULTS: Although risk of meningioma appeared modestly elevated in past OC users (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8 - 2.7), and in current users (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.5 - 12.6), the confidence intervals were wide.  Likewise, risk of meningioma was only weakly associated with past use of HRT (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 - 1.3), and not at all with current use of HRT (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.5 - 2.2).   Overall, in post menopausal women, HRT use appeared to confer a non-significant protective effect, and was not associated with low or high PR expressing meningiomas.CONCLUSION: This study found little evidence of associations between meningioma and exogenous hormone exposures in women but did suggest that some hormonal exposures may influence tumor biology in those women who develop meningioma. The increased odds ratios with African Americans was retained in post-menopausal women, while the protective odds ratios for pregnancy, smoking and oral contraceptives (OCs) became stronger in pre-menopausal women. The pattern by duration and timing of use does not suggest an etiologic role for OCs or hormone replacement therapy.  The use of hormone replacement therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women either with previously treated disease or with dormant tumors is discussed, but remains controversial. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk. OC use was associated with increased risk of a meningioma expressing less rather than more PR (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.3 - 8.0).  In further analysis by hormone receptor status, there was some indication for an increased risk of progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas associated with oral contraceptive use (OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.92-2.10) and other hormonal contraception (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95-2.36).  Several studies indicate that use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma, while associations between HRT use and risk of other brain tumors have been less explored. available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk. A significant positive association existed between meningioma risk and increased body mass index (p &lt; 0.01) while a significant negative association existed between meningioma risk and current smoking (p &lt; 0.01). Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67). A higher risk of meningioma was observed among postmenopausal women who were current users of hormone replacement therapy (HR, Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67). There was no association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk. Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk. A higher risk of meningioma was observed among postmenopausal women who were current users of hormone replacement therapy (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.18-2.71) compared with never users. Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67).	['The association between hormone replacement therapy and meningioma risk is controversial. Increased risk of meningioma was demonstrated in estrogen-only hormonal replacement therapy. However, other studies did not find an association between hormonal replacement therapy and meningioma risk.']
58bd6c5802b8c60953000012	Which disease is associated with mutations in SLC40A1 gene?	Ferroportin disease is a rare type of autosomal dominantly inherited hemochromatosis caused with mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1). The patients characteristically have hyperferritinemia but normal transferin saturations.  Novel gain of function mutation in the SLC40A1 gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis type 4. Here we report the case of a 69-year-old Chinese Han woman who presented with liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, skin hyperpigmentation, hyperferritinaemia and high transferrin saturation. Subsequent genetic analyses identified a novel heterozygous mutation (p.Cys326Phe) in the SLC40A1 gene.  A novel mutation in the SLC40A1 gene associated with reduced iron export in vitro. Ferroportin disease is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism and is caused by mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1). We present a patient with hyperferritinemia, iron overload in the liver with reticuloendothelial distribution and also in the spleen, and under treatment with erythropheresis.  These findings and the iron overload phenotype of the patient suggest that the novel mutation c.386T>C (p.L129P) in the SLC40A1 gene has incomplete penetrance and causes the classical form of ferroportin disease. Ferroportin (FPN) mediates iron export from cells and this function is modulated by serum hepcidin. Mutations in the FPN gene (SLC40A1) lead to autosomal dominant iron overload diseases related either to loss or to gain of function, and usually characterized by normal or low transferrin saturation versus elevated transferrin saturation, respectively.  Hemochromatosis type 4 is a rare form of primary iron overload transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iron transport protein ferroportin 1 (SLC40A1). SLC40A1 mutations fall into two functional categories (loss- versus gain-of-function) underlying two distinct clinical entities (hemochromatosis type 4A versus type 4B). However, the vast majority of SLC40A1 mutations are rare missense variations, with only a few showing strong evidence of causality.  p.C282Y mutation and rare variants in the HFE gene have been associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HH is also caused by mutations in other genes, such as the hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1).  Two novel mutations in the SLC40A1 and HFE genes implicated in iron overload in a Spanish man. Ferroportin disease is characterized by iron overload. It has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and has been associated with mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. Ferroportin is inhibited directly by hepcidin, a key iron-regulatory peptide, and functional consequences of SLC40A1 mutations account for observed phenotypic differences in patients with ferroportin disease.  The entire coding sequence of the SLC40A1 gene was sequenced in a pedigree, presenting with autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia. A novel SLC40A1 mutation p.R489K segregated with iron overload in a family with clinical and histopathological signs of macrophage-type ferroportin disease.  We report a novel pathological SLC40A1 variant associated with abnormal cell surface expression of ferroportin due to intracellular retention of the mutant protein. These findings predict macrophage-type ferroportin disease, the phenotype observed in this kindred. Study of the molecular cell biology of ferroportin and its mutants is key to understanding the pathogenesis of this increasingly recognized form of hemochromatosis, which responds poorly to conventional therapy. Classical ferroportin disease is characterized by hyperferritinemia, normal transferrin saturation, and iron overload in macrophages. A non-classical form is characterized by additional hepatocellular iron deposits and a high transferrin saturation. Both forms demonstrate autosomal dominant transmission and are associated with ferroportin gene (SLC40A1) mutations.  Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene result in a dominant genetic disorder [ferroportin disease; hereditary hemochromatosis type (HH) IV], characterized by iron overload with two different clinical manifestations, normal transferrin saturation with macrophage iron accumulation (the most prevalent type) or high transferrin saturation with hepatocyte iron accumulation (classical hemochromatosis phenotype). SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease. Ferroportin disease is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism and is caused by mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1). Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. A Japanese family with ferroportin disease caused by a novel mutation of SLC40A1 gene: hyperferritinemia associated with a relatively low transferrin saturation of iron. These findings and the iron overload phenotype of the patient suggest that the novel mutation c.386T>C (p.L129P) in the SLC40A1 gene has incomplete penetrance and causes the classical form of ferroportin disease. UNLABELLED: Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. This deletion affects not only COL3A1 but also 21 other known genes (GULP1, DIRC1, COL5A2, WDR75, SLC40A1, ASNSD1, ANKAR, OSGEPL1, ORMDL1, LOC100129592, PMS1, MSTN, C2orf88, HIBCH, INPP1, MFSD6, TMEM194B, NAB1, GLS, STAT1, and STAT4), mutations in three of which (COL5A2, SLC40A1, and MSTN) have also been associated with an autosomal dominant disorder (EDS classical type, hemochromatosis type 4, and muscle hypertrophy). Analysis of SLC40A1 gene at the mRNA level reveals rapidly the causative mutations in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis type IV. The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.-20G>A and c.718A>G (p.K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively. SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease A Japanese family with ferroportin disease caused by a novel mutation of SLC40A1 gene: hyperferritinemia associated with a relatively low transferrin saturation of iron SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease.  The proposed procedure would facilitate the wide-range molecular analysis of the SLC40A1 gene, contributing to better understanding the pathogenesis of the ferroportin disease. Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene result in a dominant genetic disorder [ferroportin disease; hereditary hemochromatosis type (HH) IV], characterized by iron overload with two different clinical manifestations, normal transferrin saturation with macrophage iron accumulation (the most prevalent type) or high transferrin saturation with hepatocyte iron accumulation (classical hemochromatosis phenotype).  Type IV hemochromatosis is associated with dominant mutations in the SLC40A1 gene encoding ferroportin (FPN). It has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and has been associated with mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease. It includes hereditary hemochromatosis related to mutations of other genes, ferroportin disease (also known as hemochromatosis type 4), and entities associated with specific clinical manifestations. Ferroportin disease is a special dominantly inherited clinical form of iron overload due to mutations of the SLC40A1 gene. Ferroportin disease represents a protean genetic condition in which the different SLC40A1 mutations appear to be responsible for phenotypic variability. Novel gain of function mutation in the SLC40A1 gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis type 4. These findings and the iron overload phenotype of the patient suggest that the novel mutation c.386T>C (p.L129P) in the SLC40A1 gene has incomplete penetrance and causes the classical form of ferroportin disease..

56c1f031ef6e39474100004e	Describe Hot water reflex epilepsy.	In this review we assess our currently available knowledge about reflex seizures with special emphasis on the difference between "generalized" reflex seizures induced by visual stimuli, thinking, praxis and language tasks, and "focal" seizures induced by startle, eating, music, hot water, somatosensory stimuli and orgasm. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent clobazam prophylaxis prior to head water bath might be a preferred mode of treatment of pure HWE.  Different types of reflex epilepsy such as eating, startle myoclonus, and hot water epilepsy were included in the study.  Hot water epilepsy was triggered by contact with hot water either in the bath or by hand immersion, and VEEG showed fronto-parietal involvement. Hot water epilepsy is rarely described in European countries, where bathing epilepsy in younger children is more common and often confused with this type of epilepsy. We studied the anatomical correlates of reflex hot water epilepsy (HWE) using multimodality investigations viz. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).  The clinical and SPECT studies suggested temporal lobe as the seizure onset zone in some of the patients with HWE. Hot water epilepsy (HWE) refers to a specific type of reflex epilepsy precipitated by the stimulus of bathing in hot water. Pathogenesis is still unknown and temporal lobe has been thought to take part in the epileptogenesis. HWE can be symptomatic of focal cortical malformation, and few cases were reported.

The diagnosis of hot water epilepsy was supported by an ictal EEG. Hot water epilepsy, also known as bathing epilepsy or water-immersion epilepsy is, in the Caucasian population, a rare form of benign epilepsy, where seizures are provoked by immersion in a hot or even just a warm bath. This is the first comprehensive video publication of a seizure provoked by water-immersion in a Caucasian child.  Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a form of reflex or sensory epilepsy wherein seizures are precipitated by an unusual stimulus, the contact of hot water over the head and body.  Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a rare form of reflex epilepsy caused by bathing with hot water. In this paper, we describe three cases with hot water epilepsy. &quot;Hot water epilepsy&quot; (HWE), precipitated by a bath or shower in hot water, has been described infrequently in the literature. A video-EEG recording was taken while hot water was poured onto his chest. Hot water epilepsy is rarely described in European countries, where bathing epilepsy in younger children is more common and often confused with this type of epilepsy. Hot water epilepsy (HWE) or bathing epilepsy is one of the reflex epilepsies induced by hot water pouring over the head, These two patients are the youngest reported cases of reflex hot water seizures, and the only reported cases in which reflex hot water seizures subsequently manifested episodes of alternating hemiplegia. Hot water epilepsy is a reflex epilepsy. Seizures are provoked by hot water, and result from the association of both cutaneous and heat stimuli. Hot water epilepsy belongs to the group of reflex epilepsies. Seizures are provoked by hot water, due to the association of both cutaneous and heat stimuli. A patient with reflex epilepsy is described, in whom seizures were induced by bathing in hot water.

515df1d4298dcd4e5100002b	What is the effect of Allopurinol on asphyxia in neonates?	Potential neuroprotective strategies targeting different pathways leading to neuronal cell death in response to hypoxic-ischemic insult have been investigated: hypothermia, erythropoietin, iminobiotin, deferioxamine, magnesium, allopurinol, xenon, melatonin and statins. Allopurinol reduces the formation of free radicals, thereby potentially limiting the amount of hypoxia-reperfusion damage. There were no differences in long-term outcome between the allopurinol-treated infants and controls. However, subgroup analysis of the moderately asphyxiated group showed significantly less severe adverse outcome in the allopurinol-treated infants compared with controls (25% vs 65%; RR 0.40, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.94). The reported data may suggest a (neuro)protective effect of neonatal allopurinol treatment in moderately asphyxiated infants. The asphyxiated newborns treated with allopurinol had better neurologic and neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 or more months of age. In newborn infants, allopurinol is being tested as a free radical scavenger to prevent brain damage caused by reperfusion and oxygenation after perinatal hypoxia and ischemia (birth asphyxia). Early postnatal allopurinol does not improve short term outcome after severe birth asphyxia. The analysis showed an unaltered (high) mortality and morbidity in the infants treated with allopurinol. Allopurinol treatment started postnatally was too late to reduce the early reperfusion induced free radical surge. One randomized trial of allopurinol showed short-term benefits but was too small to test death or disability. No toxic side effects of ALLO were detected. This study suggests a beneficial effect of ALLO treatment on free radical formation, CBV, and electrical brain activity, without toxic side effects.	['Allopurinol was shown in a number of clinical trial to be safe and effective for treatment of neonatal asphyxia. Allopurinol  improves short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of neonatal asphyxia. Allopurinol should be administered as soon as possible. Postulated mechanism of allopurinol action in this setting is prevention of hypoxia-perfusion injury by reduction of free radical formation.']

In this study, we produced stabilized ERAP1-ERAP2 heterodimers and found that they produced several mature epitopes more efficiently than a mix of the two enzymes unable to dimerize. Physical interaction with ERAP2 changes basic enzymatic parameters of ERAP1 and improves its substrate-binding affinity. Thus, by bringing the two enzymes in proximity and by producing allosteric effects on ERAP1, dimerization of ERAP1/2 creates complexes with superior peptide-trimming efficacy. Such complexes are likely to enhance Ag presentation by cells displaying coordinated expression of the two enzymes.

552446612c8b63434a00000c	What is known as Von Hippel–Lindau disease or syndrome?	Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited phacomatosis with a predisposition for the central nervous system and retina. There is variable expression with hemangioblastomas in the brain, medulla oblongata, spinal chord, renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and islet cell tumors as well as tumors of the endolymphatic sac of the inner ear. Clinical symptoms occur first after an age of approximately 30 years. Von Hippel-Lindau Disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant inherited systemic cancer syndrome that gives rise to cystic and highly vascularized tumors in many organs, including the eye. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary, autosomal dominant syndrome which is manifested by a range of different benign and malignant tumors. This disease can present with different clinical presentations such as; retinal angioma (RA), hemangioblastoma (HB) of the central nervous system (CNS), pheochromocytoma (Pheo), and epididymal cystadenoma. Tumors are usually accompanied with cysts. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome associated with mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (3p25-26). Its estimated incidence ranges from 1 in 36,000 to 1 in 53,000 with a penetrance of up to 95% by age 60. Genotype-phenotype correlation divides VHL into two broad clinical subtypes. Type 1 VHL is predominantly associated with large deletion or truncation mutations which result in an encoded protein with very little or no activity. It is associated with retinal and CNS hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma but not pheochromocytoma. Type 2 is usually associated with missense mutations encoding a protein with limited activity and includes pheochromocytoma. It is further classified into three other subtypes (2A, 2B, 2C) based on the presence of hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma. Visceral cysts in the kidney, pancreas and epididymis, nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which often show distinctive clear cell cytology, endolymphatic sac tumors and head and neck paragangliomas are well recognized but less common presenting features. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inheritable multisystem tumor syndrome characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors affecting multiple organs. VHL is the result of a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Molecular genomic analysis routinely confirms the clinical diagnosis. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome (1/36,000 live births) with highly penetrance that predispose to the development of a panel of highly vascularized tumors (model of tumoral angiogenesis). Main manifestations include central nervous system (CNS) and retinal haemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited syndrome caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, predisposing to a variety of neoplasms including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET).  Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder involving the development of specific tumours in multiple organs, both benign and malignant. In the CNS, the syndrome is characterized by haemangioblastomas of the retina, spinal cord and brain.  Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) often harbor significant disease burden within the CNS, specifically craniospinal-axis hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs). The majority (60-80%) of patients with VHL harbor hemangioblastomas, and 10-15% will develop ELSTs. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome predisposing the affected individuals to multiple tumours in various organs. von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) disease increases susceptibility to several malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, haemangioblastomas of the central nervous system or retina and phaeochromocytomas. The VHL tumour suppressor gene, responsible for the disease, encodes for a major regulator of the hypoxic response by targeting the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) for degradation. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHLS) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome arising from germ-line inactivation of the VHL gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. VHLS manifests in a myriad of hyper-vascular tumors of both benign and malignant nature. Incidence of VHLS is roughly 1 in 36,000 live births and has over 90% penetrance by the age of 65.  Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene is responsible for the development of renal carcinomas, pheochromocytomas and tumours in other organs. The gene product (pVHL) is a central component in the oxygen-sensing pathway through its role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Loss of pVHL leads to activation of the HIF pathway in normoxia with the concomitant increase in tumour vascularisation due to the up-regulation of pro-angiogenic genes. Germ line inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene causes von Hippel-Lindau hereditary cancer syndrome, and somatic mutations of this gene have been linked to the development of sporadic hemangioblastomas and clear cell renal carcinomas. The protein encoded by VHL, pVHL, has no known enzymatic activities but interacts with various partner proteins. pVHL acts as a multi-purpose adaptor protein that controls different gene expression programs. Through its oxygen-dependent regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha), pVHL plays a central role in the oxygen-sensing pathway. In addition, many HIFalpha-independent functions of pVHL have recently been identified. These include microtubule-based processes, extracellular matrix assembly and suppression of kidney cyst formation.  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited multisystem familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p25. A wide variety of neoplastic processes are known to be associated with VHL disease.  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited multisystem disorder characterized by development of a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of the disease is broad and includes retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cysts and tumors, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cystadenomas. The most common causes of death in VHL disease patients are renal cell carcinoma and neurologic complications from cerebellar hemangioblastomas.  Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL disease) is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene. von Hippel-Lindau disease is an inherited, multisystemic cancer syndrome often involving the retina. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome associated with mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (3p25-26).

5fdb4112a43ad31278000016	How are super enhancers defined?	Super-enhancers comprise of clusters of enhancers that are typically defined by the ChIP-seq analysis for active histone marks.  called super-enhancers, that recruit much of the cell's transcriptional apparatus and are defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac).  Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes controlling cell identity.  Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers regarded as having essential roles in driving the expression of genes that control cell identity during development and tumorigenesis. Super-enhancers are important for controlling and defining the expression of cell-specific genes.  Furthermore, we identified a group of 45 subtype-specific super enhancers that are associated with poorer prognosis and are highly dependent on deltaNp63. Here we report that enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) identified by global nuclear run-on sequencing are extensively transcribed within super enhancers and are dynamically regulated in response to cellular signaling. Defined as genomic regions containing clusters of multiple enhancers, super enhancers play pivotal roles in cell/tissue specification, identity, and maintenance. Defined by their magnitude of size, transcription factor density, and binding of transcriptional machinery, super-enhancers have been associated with genes driving cell differentiation. Super-enhancers define a proliferative PGC-1α-expressing melanoma subgroup sensitive to BET inhibition. Cell-line-defined super-enhancers can be subclassified by their somatic alteration status into somatic gain, loss and unaltered categories, each displaying distinct epigenetic, transcriptional and pathway enrichments. Super-enhancers (SE) have become a popular concept and are widely used as a feature defining key identity genes. Super-enhancers: Asset management in immune cell genomes. Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of transcriptional enhancers which control the expression of cell identity and disease-associated genes. Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that are co-occupied by multiple lineage-specific transcription factors driving expression of genes that define cell identity. Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes controlling cell identity. Super-enhancers are large clusters of enhancers that activate gene expression. They are also preferentially bound by the chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesin, in contrast to super-enhancers, forming clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions and defining homotypic clusters of transcription regulator binding regions (HCTs). Super-enhancers and stretch enhancers represent classes of transcriptional enhancers that have been shown to control the expression of cell identity genes and carry disease- and trait-associated variants. We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome, and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers. In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex, and more transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers. Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes. These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers. Super-enhancers in the control of cell identity and disease. Super-enhancers are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell identity. Here we review the identification and composition of super-enhancers, describe links between super-enhancers, gene regulation and disease, and discuss the functional significance of enhancer clustering. The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification. Our opinion is that there is not yet strong evidence that super-enhancers are a novel paradigm in gene regulation and that use of the term in this context is not currently justified. We also provide our perspective regarding the proposition that super-enhancers are a regulatory entity conceptually distinct from what was known before the introduction of the term. BACKGROUND: Super-enhancers or stretch enhancers are clusters of active enhancers that often coordinate cell-type specific gene regulation during development and diff Super-enhancers are clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive cell-type-specific gene expression and are crucial to cell identity. Super-enhancers (SEs) are regions of the genome consisting of clusters of regulatory elements bound with very high amounts of transcription factors, and this architecture appears to be the hallmark of genes and noncoding RNAs linked with cell identity.

We propose a cross-species gene classification across the Full Spectrum of Intolerance to Loss-of-function (FUSIL) and demonstrate that genes in five mutually exclusive FUSIL categories have differing biological properties.

5e48bb12d14c9f295d000016	Describe the mechanism of action of pitolisant.	Given the breadth of compounds developed and potential therapeutic indications, we assessed the comparative pharmacology of six investigational histamine H3 agents, including pitolisant, using native tissue and recombinant cells. Whilst all of the compounds tested displayed robust histamine H3 receptor inverse agonism and did not differentiate between the main H3 receptor splice variants, they displayed a wide range of affinities and kinetic properties, and included rapidly dissociating (pitolisant, S 38093-2, ABT-239) and slowly dissociating (GSK189254, JNJ-5207852, PF-3654746) agents. S 38093-2 had the lowest histamine H3 receptor affinity (pKB values 5.7-6.2), seemingly at odds with previously reported, potent in vivo activity in models of cognition.  The pharmacological profile of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, indicates that this compound might reduce body weight and metabolic disturbances. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol [JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium oxybate, and the H3-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant.  In March 2016, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for pitolisant (WakixR) (as the first representative of the H3 inverse agonists) for the treatment of narcolepsy. They can be used for therapeutic purposes; e.g., the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist mirtazapine is used as an antidepressant and the inverse histamine H3 receptor agonist pitolisant has been marketed as a new drug for the treatment of narcolepsy in 2016.

Chargaff' s second parity rule (PR2) states that complementary nucleotides are met with almost equal frequencies in single stranded DNA. Sueoka and Lobry declared respectively that, in the absence of bias between the two DNA strands for mutation and selection, the base composition within each strand should be A=T and C=G (this state is called Parity Rule type 2, PR2) The intra-strand Parity Rule 2 of DNA (PR2) states that A=T and G=C within each strands. deviations from the PR2 is a sign of strand-specific (or asymmetric) mutation and/or selection pressures. PR2 is an intra-strand rule where A=T and G=C are expected when there are no biases between the two complementary strands of DNA in mutation and selection rates (substitution rates) When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2) The second method was to plot the intrastrand bias of the third codon position from Parity Rule 2 (PR2), where A = T and G = C. The extent of deviation from intra-strand equality rule of A = T and G = C (Parity Rule 2, or PR2) is specific for individual amino acids and has been expressed as the PR2-bias fingerprint.

BACKGROUND: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.   61% of patients with swirl sign were dead at one month compared with 21% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Only 19% of patients with swirl sign exhibited favorable outcome at three months compared with 53% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p<0.001). Swirl sign was independent predictor of death at one month (p = 0.03; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 - 6), and functional outcome at three months (p = 0.045; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.02 - 6.5).CONCLUSIONS: As swirl sign showed to be an ominous sign, we recommend identification of this sign in cases of ICHs. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape.  Risk of evolution toward BD was classified as low (corneal reflexes present and no swirl sign), high (≥1 corneal reflexes abolished and swirl sign), and intermediate. Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p < 0.001). <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.

CONCLUSIONS As swirl sign showed to be an ominous sign, we recommend identification of this sign in cases of ICHs. In conclusion, the occurrence of the swirl sign on the head CT scan of patients with AEDH was found to be significantly associated with poor outcome.

Bedaquiline works by inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and represents the first novel class of antituberculosis agents in more than 40 years.  Bedaquiline has an entirely novel mechanism of action and so should be active against otherwise highly resistant organisms. It acts on the transmembrane component of adenosine triphosphate synthase and acts by preventing electron transport. Bedaquiline - The first ATP synthase inhibitor against multi drug resistant tuberculosis.  Bedaquiline is an anti-tuberculosis drug with unique mechanism of action. It selectively inhibits the mycobacterial energy metabolism i.e. ATP synthesis and found to be effective against all states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis like active, dormant, replicating, non-replicating, intracellular and extracellular. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bedaquiline possesses a unique mechanism of action that disrupts the activity of the mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate synthase.  By directly inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, bedaquiline is effective against both replicating and dormant mycobacteria.  Enhanced sterilizing capacity via synergistic depletion of ATP further exhibits the promising potential of bedaquiline with pyrazinamide.

We developed the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to analyze the functional significance of cis-regulatory regions identified by localized measurements of DNA binding events across an entire genome. Whereas previous methods took into account only binding proximal to genes, GREAT is able to properly incorporate distal binding sites and control for false positives using a binomial test over the input genomic regions  GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses.

54dfcdf81388e8454a00000a	What is the mechanism of action of APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase to inhibit HIV-1 replication?	APOBEC3G inhibits HIV-1 RNA elongation by inactivating the viral trans-activation response element Deamination of cytidine residues in viral DNA is a major mechanism by which APOBEC3G (A3G) inhibits vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. dC-to-dU transition following RNase-H activity leads to viral cDNA degradation, production of non-functional proteins, formation of undesired stop codons and decreased viral protein synthesis HIV-1 transcription elongation is regulated by the trans-activation response (TAR) element, a short stem-loop RNA structure required for elongation factors binding. Vif-deficient HIV-1-infected cells accumulate short viral transcripts and produce lower amounts of full-length HIV-1 transcripts due to A3G deamination of the TAR apical loop cytidine, highlighting the requirement for TAR loop integrity in HIV-1 transcription The APOBEC3 deoxycytidine deaminase family functions as host restriction factors that can block replication of Vif (virus infectivity factor) deficient HIV-1 virions to differing degrees by deaminating cytosines to uracils in single-stranded (-)HIV-1 DNA. Upon replication of the (-)DNA to (+)DNA, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase incorporates adenines opposite the uracils, thereby inducing C/G→T/A mutations that can functionally inactivate HIV-1 APOBEC3G is a member of this family that inhibits HIV-1 replication in the absence of the viral infectivity factor Vif. Inhibition of HIV replication occurs by both deamination of viral single-stranded DNA and a deamination-independent mechanism Suppression of HIV-1 infection by APOBEC3 proteins in primary human CD4(+) T cells is associated with inhibition of processive reverse transcription as well as excessive cytidine deamination These proteins exert their suppressive effects through the inhibition of viral reverse transcription as well as the induction of cytidine deamination within nascent viral cDNA We demonstrate that APOBEC3 proteins impart a profound deficiency to reverse transcription from the initial stages of cDNA synthesis, as well as excessive cytidine deamination (hypermutation) of the DNAs that are synthesized Without Vif, A3 proteins, particularly APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), inhibit HIV-1 replication by blocking reverse transcription and/or integration and hypermutating nascent viral cDNA. The molecular mechanisms of this antiviral activity have been primarily attributed to two biochemical characteristics common to A3 proteins: catalyzing cytidine deamination in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a nucleic acid-binding capability that is specific to ssDNA or ssRNA A host cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3G (A3G), inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by incorporating into virions in the absence of the virally encoded Vif protein (Deltavif virions), at least in part by causing G-to-A hypermutation. APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G cytidine deaminases potently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by enzymatically inserting G-to-A mutations in viral DNA and/or impairing viral reverse transcription independently of their deaminase activity	['During reverse transcription, APOBEC3G deaminates dC to dU in nascent minus-strand viral DNA, resulting in G-to-A hypermutation in the plus strand DNA to inhibit replication of HIV-1, due to viral cDNA degradation, production of non-functional proteins, formation of undesired stop codons and decreased viral protein synthesis. In an additional line of antiviral defense, APOBEC3G induces deamination of the apical loop cytidine of the trans-activation response (TAR) element, a short stem-loop RNA structure required for binding of elongation factors during HIV-1 transcription elongation, resulting in accumulation of short viral transcripts and production of lower amounts of full-length HIV-1 transcripts in Vif-deficient HIV-1-infected cells.']

56c3323a50c68dd416000009	How is spastic diplegia diagnosed?	Spastic diplegia is the most common form of cerebral palsy worldwide. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and spastic diplegia (SD) patients share a strong clinical resemblance. Thus, HSP patients are frequently misdiagnosed with a mild form of SD. Clinical gait analysis (CGA) has been highlighted as a possible tool to support the differential diagnosis of HSP and SD The predominant clinical feature of patients with Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP) is gait disturbance owing to spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs; the spasticity in early-onset disease (infancy or childhood) often cannot be distinguished from mild form of spastic diplegia (SD) The aim of this study was to quantify the gait strategy in HSP and SD children, focusing on the differences between groups as concerns functional limitation during gait. 9 HSP and 16 SD children were evaluated using Gait Analysis; kinematic and kinetic parameters and EMG pattern during walking were identified and calculated to compare the two gait strategies In contrast to other urea cycle disorders, hyperammonemic encephalopathy is rarely observed in patients with argininemia. Rather, most exhibit an insidious onset and progression of neurologic manifestations, including spastic diplegia. We conclude that argininemia should be considered more frequently in the differential diagnosis of a patient with slowly progressive neurologic manifestations, especially progressive spastic diplegia, even in a population where argininemia was previously unknown To assess the reliability and validity of a newly described classification of sagittal plane alignment in spastic diplegic gait. The objective of this prospective study was the application of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in children with spastic diplegia (SD) to determine the metabolite profile of SD children in the left basal ganglia, and to assess the relationship of this profile with motor and mental developmen The aim of this study was to establish the reliability and validity of visual gait assessment in children with spastic diplegia, who were community or household ambulators, using a modified version of the Physicians Rating Scale, known as the Observational Gait Scale (OGS). The aim of this study was to analyse quantitatively the gait of HSP and SD subjects in order to define the gait pattern in HSP and the differences between the two conditions This study shows that GA complements traditional clinical evaluations, making it possible to distinguish, clearly, between motor ability in HSP and in SD patients; the duration of the knee hyperextension during midstance was found to discriminate between the two gait patterns. nstruct validity of the In-Hand Manipulation Test (IMT) by assessing the test's ability to discriminate between samples of children with and without known fine motor problems.METHOD: The IMT was administered to 55 children without known fine motor problems and 24 children with spastic diplegia who had mild to moderate fine motor problems. A discriminant analysis indicated that IMT total score correctly classified 83.33% of the participants as having or not having fine motor problems. Calcaneal gait or deformity can be a significant complication after heel cord lengthening. After heel cord lengthening, 20 children with spastic diplegia were evaluated by gait analysis to define calcaneal gait objectively and describe associated morbidity. Significant differences were found in birth weight, birth head circumference, and the one-minute Apgar score  Intracranial hemorrhage and neonatal seizures occurred significantly more often in infants with SD On the Movement Assessment of Infants at 4 months of age, the children with hemiplegia and quadriplegia showed significantly higher risk scores than the nonhandicapped group At 1 year of age, however, the Bayley Motor Scale was extremely sensitive in picking up motor deficits in children with all three types of cerebral palsy. Hip flexion combined with knee extension (leg elevation) and isolated knee movements were not seen in diplegic infants, but were seen in all control preterm infants with a good prognosis, after five and six months corrected age, respectively. The absence of these movements is a useful diagnostic item for spastic diplegia. Full body gait analysis may improve diagnostic discrimination between hereditary spastic paraplegia and spastic diplegia Clinical gait analysis (CGA) has been highlighted as a possible tool to support the differential diagnosis of HSP and SD. Previous analysis has focused on the lower-body but not the upper-body, where numerous compensations during walking occur. The aim of this study was to compare the full-body movements of HSP and SD groups and, in particular, the movement of the upper limbs The study subjects were eight patients with spastic diplegia and eight normal children. Three-dimensional gait analysis was used for the survey. The measured gait variables were the joints of the lower extremity in the sagittal plane, frontal plane, and transverse planes and the maximum and minimum angles of their stance phase and swing phases Relationships between spasticity, strength, gait, and the GMFM-66 in persons with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy. [Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effects of Vojta therapy on spatiotemporal gait parameters in children with spastic diplegia. [Methods] The study population consisted of 3 children diagnosed with spastic diplegia. The aim of this study was to explore the physical status and gait patterns of children with spastic diplegia secondary to human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy (HIVE).  A cross-sectional study was conducted on children diagnosed with HIVE and spastic diplegia. The results demonstrated that HSP patients used more spine movement to compensate for lower limb movement alterations, whereas SD patients used their arms for compensation To investigate the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns and motor function, epileptic episodes, and IQ or developmental quotient in patients born at term with spastic diplegia To examine the validity and clinical utility of functional assessments (1-minute walk test, 10-meter walk test, Timed Up&Go [TUG] test, Timed Up and Down Stairs [TUDS]test, sit-to-stand [STS] test, and lateral step-up [LSU]test) These functional assessments (1-minute walk, LSU, and 10-meter walk tests) are simple to administer, quick, low cost, and user-friendly. Although these assessments are not a substitute for the criterion standard (GMFM-88), they may be used for a quick assessment in adolescents with cerebral palsy (levels I-III) either at school or during rehabilitation, especially when time is limited The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dynamic bilateral postural stability on balance control and gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy.DESIGN: Thirty children with spastic diplegia (8-10 yrs) were included in this study	['Diagnosis of spastic diplegia is mainly carried out with through clinical gait analysis (CGA), with variations such as 1-minute walk, LSU, and 10-meter walk tests, or Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88).

5895b9ae7d9090f35300000a	Describe what is athelia syndrome?	Athelia is a very rare entity that is defined by the absence of the nipple-areola complex.  Absence of the nipple, areola (athelia), or the breast tissue (amastia) is less frequent. The absence of nipple-areola complex is a rare entity and is always associated with other anomalies. This paper described a case of bilateral athelia without other alterations. Athelia is a very rare entity that is defined by the absence of the nipple-areola complex. It can affect either sex and is mostly part of syndromes including other congenital or ectodermal anomalies, such as limb-mammary syndrome, scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, or ectodermal dysplasias. Here, we report on three children from two branches of an extended consanguineous Israeli Arab family, a girl and two boys, who presented with a spectrum of nipple anomalies ranging from unilateral hypothelia to bilateral athelia but no other consistently associated anomalies except a characteristic eyebrow shape.

The cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) technology has been established to detect transcriptional starting sites (TSSs) and expression levels by utilizing 5' cDNA tags and PCR. It has been reported that the amount of templates is proportional to the amplification efficiency of PCR. CAGE has been used as a key technique for analyzing promoter activity and finding new transcripts including alternative spliced products and noncoding transcripts. Here, we introduce more powerful tools such as deepCAGE, which can be utilized for high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology.

5324d0429b2d7acc7e000023	What are the reported adverse effects of topical minoxidil?	Hypertrichosis is a well-recognized adverse effect of therapy with either oral or topical minoxidil. reported increase of adverse events (additional hair growth on areas other than the scalp) with minoxidil (5%) twice daily.  a case of central serous chorioretinopathy after application of topical minoxidil solution. One month after the drug was discontinued, normal findings were found upon reexamination The incidence of adverse effects such as pruritus or local irritation was similar in the 5% minoxidil group The patients tolerated treatment with 1% topical minoxidil well without significant adverse effects. An increased occurrence of pruritus, local irritation, and hypertrichosis was observed with 5% topical minoxidil versus 2% topical minoxidil and placebo. Allergic contact dermatitis to topical minoxidil solution: etiology and treatment. However, some patients present with complaints of pruritus and scaling of the scalp. The most common causes of these symptoms include irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, or an exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis. Patients suffering from allergic contact dermatitis may benefit from patch testing to determine the causative allergen. Among the patients we patch tested, propylene glycol was found to be the contactant in a majority of cases, not the minoxidil itself.  A case of acute myocardial infarction associated with topical use of minoxidil (RiUP) for treatment of baldness. A 45-year-old Japanese man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) developed acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction (MI). He had used 1% topical minoxidil (RiUP) once a day for 4 months before the onset of MI for treatment of baldness. Diffuse hypertrichosis during treatment with 5% topical minoxidil. Five women affected by androgenetic alopecia developed severe hypertrichosis of the face and limbs after 2-3 months of treatment with 5% topical minoxidil. Minoxidil was discontinued and in all patients the hypertrichosis disappeared from the face and arms after 1-3 months, and from legs after 4-5 months Generalized hypertrichosis after treatment with topical minoxidil. hypertrichosis is uncommon after treatment with topical minoxidil for alopecia, and normally only occurs in areas close to the site of application. A 16-year-old girl is presented who developed generalized hypertrichosis 3 months after applying topical minoxidil for treatment of diffuse alopecia in doses greater than that prescribed Two of our patients developed smoking intolerance during treatment with topical minoxidil for androgenital alopecia. The relation between treatment with minoxidil and smoking intolerance was emphasized by stopping treatment and the disappearance of the smoking intolerance, and then by rechallenge in both patients.  We observed an as yet unreported "polymyalgia syndrome" in four otherwise healthy males whose sole medication was topically applied minoxidil. They experienced fatigue, weight loss and severe pain in the shoulders and pelvic girdle, suggesting connective tissue disease. Three patients had a transient rise in liver enzymes, while other laboratory analyses remained normal. Tritanomaly was detected in two patients who underwent systematic color vision testing. All symptoms disappeared after withdrawal of minoxidil. Rechallenge was positive once in one patient and twice in another.  During 6 months of follow-up, blood pressure did not change, whereas minoxidil increased heart rate by 3-5 beats min-1. Compared with placebo, topical minoxidil caused significant increases in LV end-diastolic volume, in cardiac output (by 0.751 min-1) and in LV mass (by 5 g m-2). We conclude that in healthy subjects short-term use of topical minoxidil is likely not to be detrimental. However, safety needs to be established regarding ischaemic symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease as well as for the possible development of LV hypertrophy in healthy subjects during years of therapy. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are mild scalp dryness and irritation and, rarely, allergic contact dermatitis. Eight deaths that occurred during Upjohn-sponsored clinical trials of topical minoxidil and two deaths in subjects who used extemporaneous formulations of the drug are summarized. Of the eight patients in clinical trials, five had cardiovascular abnormalities and two had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related pneumonia. One patient died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial infarction. There is little likelihood of significant adverse effects attributable to topical minoxidil because of its low systemic absorption. The evidence suggests that these deaths were the result of causes other than use of the drug. Only 2% of prescribers reported complications other than local irritation that they associated with topical minoxidil therapy, but underreporting of noncutaneous side effects in this survey of dermatologists cannot be excluded. Typical side effects of this topical treatment include irritative dermatitis going along with pruritus, erythema, scaling and dryness, which occur especially at the onset of the therapy. In some cases, allergic contact dermatitis or exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis has been reported. While most of the patients with allergic contact dermatitis described in the literature showed a positive sensitization to the vehicle substance propylene glycol evaluated by patch testing, reactions to the active ingredient minoxidil are rare	['Typical side effects of this topical treatment include irritative dermatitis going along with pruritus, erythema, scaling and dryness, which occur especially at the onset of the therapy.

604f632494d57fd879000007	What is the effect of the venom of the cone snail, Conus tulipa?	Thus, C. tulipa venom comprised both paralytic (putative ion channel modulating α-, ω-, μ-, δ-) and non-paralytic (conantokins, con-ikot-ikots, conopressins) conotoxins.  More than 100 species of venomous cone snails (genus Conus) are highly effective predators of fish. The vast majority of venom components identified and functionally characterized to date are neurotoxins specifically targeted to receptors, ion channels, and transporters in the nervous system of prey, predators, or competitors. The fish-hunting marine cone snail Conus geographus uses a specialized venom insulin to induce hypoglycemic shock in its prey. Conantokin-T, a 21-amino acid peptide which induces sleep-like symptoms in young mice was purified from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, Conus tulipa. This study investigated the mode of action of conantokin-T, a 21 amino acid peptide toxin isolated from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail Conus tulipa, on excitatory synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices using intracellular recording techniques.  Conantokin-T, a 21-amino acid peptide which induces sleep-like symptoms in young mice was purified from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, Conus tulipa.  Thus, C. tulipa venom comprised both paralytic (putative ion channel modulating α-, ω-, μ-, δ-) and non-paralytic (conantokins, con-ikot-ikots, conopressins) conotoxins. This venomic study confirms the potential for non-paralytic conotoxins to contribute to the net-hunting strategy of C. tulipa.

589a245678275d0c4a000023	Describe clinical applications of the PIM2 scoring system.	In this study, we examine if transfusion is an independent predictor of mortality, or if outcomes are merely a result of the initial severity as predicted by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III, Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2), and day 1 Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores. INTRODUCTION: The Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) is one of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict mortality in patients admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in Argentina. CONCLUSIONS: The PIM2 score adequately discriminates survivors from non-survivors. PIM2 scoring did not explain the outcome adequately, suggesting need for recalibration. CONCLUSION: PIM2 scoring system show adequate discriminatory function and well calibrated for the case mix of patients in PICU of Fayoum, Egypt. It can be used as beneficial tool for evaluation of risk adjusted mortality.  The aim of the study was to explore the association between Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2) and Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the long-term outcome of children with injuries. Pediatric index of mortality 2 score as an outcome predictor in pediatric Intensive Care Unit in India. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pediatric index of mortality (PIM) 2 score is one of the severity scoring systems being used for predicting outcome of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). CONCLUSION: PIM2 score discriminated well between survivors and death at PICU. OBJECTIVE: A study to validate and calibrate Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM2) in children admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). CONCLUSION: PIM2 is a good index for prediction of mortality in our pediatric intensive care unit.  The Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) is one of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict mortality in patients admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in Argentina. Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) are scoring systems to predict mortality likehood; thus, it is necessary to validate such predictors in Pediatric Intensive Care Units' population. Although PRISM, PIM and PIM2 have displayed good discrimination and calibration in the present setting, PIM is considered as the most accurate and appropriate tool for predicting mortality in the studied NICU. The PIM2 score adequately discriminates survivors from non-survivors.

52fb19ab2059c6d71c00005c	What are the pregnancy outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis?	Patients with rheumatic disease can have successful pregnancy outcomes, particularly when a collaborative approach between the rheumatologist and obstetrician is applied.  Of 78 JIA pregnancies, 53 (68%) were delivered by either Caesarean section (n = 40, 51%) or instrumental delivery (n = 13, 17%); compared with other women, those with JIA had significantly higher rates of pre-eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage and severe maternal morbidity. Compared with other infants, those with mothers with JIA were more likely to be born prematurely, but were not at increased risk of being small for gestational age, requiring neonatal intensive care, having a low Apgar score at 5 min or severe neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Infants of women with JIA did not have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Intensive obstetric care might be required during pregnancy for women with JIA given the increased risk of maternal morbidity. High rate of preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by rheumatoid arthritis. Women with RA may be at higher risk for preterm delivery. A significant increase in frequency and number of cesarean deliveries, besides a higher number of pregnancies with preeclampsia, were found after RA onset. Additionally, four newborns with congenital anomalies were reported after the disease onset compared to none before RA onset. CONCLUSIONS: compared to pre-RA obstetric events, a higher frequency and number of adverse outcomes was found in pregnancies that occurred after RA onset. There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity in Canadian women with RA or SLE. Most pregnancies in women with rheumatologic disease will result in the delivery of a healthy baby. Pregnancy can be particularly risky in women with active disease or on teratogenic medications, Rheumatoid arthritis typically improves and does not have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes. Although the sample size is small, these data do not support the notion that there is a substantial increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to leflunomide exposure among women who undergo cholestyramine elimination procedure early in pregnancy. Nonetheless, pregnancies in most autoimmune diseases are still classified as high risk because of the potential for major complications. These complications include disease exacerbations during gestation and increased perinatal mortality and morbidity in most autoimmune diseases, We conclude that pregnancy outcome in patients with SLE in India is worse in comparison to patients with RA.  Women with RA had an increased risk of LBW, SGA babies, preeclampsia and CS compared with unaffected women. Infants of women with rheumatoid arthritis had increased risk of cesarean delivery (adjusted approximate relative risk, aRR=1.66, 95% CI (1.22, 2.26)), prematurity (aRR=1.78, 95% CI (1.21, 2.60)), and longer birth hospitalization (aRR=1.86, 95% CI (1.32, 2.60)) compared to those born to women without rheumatoid arthritis. Women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM had significantly increased rates of hypertensive disorders compared with the general obstetric population (23.2%, 11.1%, 27.4%, and 7.8%, respectively), longer hospital stays, and significantly higher risk of cesarean delivery. Although women with SLE, RA, and pregestational DM were significantly older than women in the general obstetric population, disparities in the risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy remained statistically significant after adjustment for maternal age. women with SLE and RA appear to have a higher age-adjusted risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancy and longer hospital stays than do pregnant women in the general population, and careful antenatal monitoring should be performed. In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX. However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains. In general, active inflammation from rheumatic diseases poses a stronger threat to the well-being of both mother and foetus than many immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, continued immunosuppression with the least risky medications will allow for the most optimal pregnancy outcomes.	['There is increased obstetrical and neonatal morbidity.

5aacd83ffcf4565872000008	What is PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance?	PARPi has been designed and tested for many years and became a potential supplement for the conventional chemotherapy. However, increasing evidence indicates the appearance of the resistance to this treatment. Specifically, cancer cells may acquire new mutations or events that overcome the positive effect of these drugs. Recent studies have shown that PARP-1 could be either oncogenic or tumor suppressive in different cancers. PARP inhibitor resistance is also a growing concern in the clinical setting. Recently, changes in the levels of PARP-1 activity or expression in cancer patients have provided the basis for consideration of PARP-1 regulatory proteins as potential biomarkers.  However, emerging data have also shown that even BRCA-mutant cells may be resistant to PARPi. The mechanistic basis for these drug resistances is poorly understood.

5e4700e03f54159529000015	What is RiboTag profiling?	RiboTag is a flexible tool for measuring the translational state of targeted cells in heterogeneous cell cultures. Here we describe our adaptation of a ribosomal capture strategy that was designed to be used in transgenic mice expressing tagged ribosomal subunits (RiboTag) in specific cell types, thereby allowing measurement of translating RNAs from desired cell types within complex tissues. Using this strategy we were able to isolate and analyze neuron-specific RNA despite the presence of glia by co-transfecting experimental plasmids with plasmids that selectively express RiboTag in neurons. RiboTag immunoprecipitation was capable of recovering high integrity RNA from small numbers of transfected cells that can then be interrogated by a variety of methods (e.g., RT-qPCR, PCR array, RNA-Seq) and compared with basal RNA expression of the entire culture. Additionally, we demonstrate how co-transfection of RiboTag with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs can validate and accurately assess the degree of gene expression knockdown, and how RiboTag can be used to measure receptor-mediated gene regulation with transiently expressed designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). RiboTag co-transfection represents a convenient and powerful tool to isolate RNA from a specific subset of cultured cells with a variety of applications for experiments in vitro.

5173b5ea8ed59a060a00001f	Which histone modifications have been associated to alternative splicing?	We found that several types of histone modifications including H3K36me3 were associated with the inclusion or exclusion of alternative exons. Furthermore, we observed that the levels of H3K36me3 and H3K79me1 in the cell lines were well correlated with the differences in alternative splicing patterns between the cell lines. Here we find that elevated levels of trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys9 (H3K9me3) are a characteristic of the alternative exons of several genes including CD44. he first report shows that a physiological stimulus such as neuron depolarization promotes intragenic histone acetylation (H3K9ac) and chromatin relaxation, causing the skipping of exon 18 of the neural cell adhesion molecule gene. Using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we increased the levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 in the proximity of alternative exon 33 of the human fibronectin gene, favoring its inclusion into mature messenger RNA (mRNA) through a mechanism that recalls RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly related to exon expression	['H3K36m3 has been systematically associated to exon inclusion in almost all published studies.
