5c61bd04e842deac67000002	Which two drugs are included in the Entresto pill?	A novel antihypertensive drug, LCZ696 (Entresto®), has recently been introduced, which combines the action of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), effectively decreasing the blood pressure, with an inhibition of neprilysin, which is responsible for metabolizing natriuretic peptides exerting antihypertensive and antifibrotic effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENTRESTO-SAS trial is a 3-month, multicentric, prospective, open-label real-life cohort study. Patients eligible for sacubitril-valsartan treatment (i.e. adults with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) will be evaluated before and after 3 months of treatment (nocturnal ventilatory polygraphy, echocardiography, laboratory testing, and quality-of-life and SDB questionnaires).   We sought to assess in the ENTRESTO-SAS trial whether sacubitril-valsartan could improve the outcome of SDB in CHF patients. This positive change in regulatory perspective coupled with successful commercialization of valsartan-sacubitril co-crystal (Entresto, Novartis) has now brought co-crystals into focus, in both industries as well as academia. We present a case of a 61-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy receiving sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto; Novartis, Cambridge, MA) who developed profound hypotension after HT. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug with brand name Entresto (Sacubitril/Valsartan or LCZ696), an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs.

58d8e9bd8acda3452900000b	Which are the clinical symptoms of left ventricular noncompaction?	Perioperative management of the patient with LVNC might be challenging due to the clinical symptoms of heart failure, systemic thromboembolic events, and fatal left ventricular arrhythmias. Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a rare type of congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by prematurely arrested compaction of the endocardial and myocardial fibers and the progressive deterioration of left ventricular contractility.  Clinical features associated with LVNC vary in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and include the potential for heart failure, conduction defects (eg, left bundle branch block), supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and sudden cardiac death.  The clinical presentations are variable ranging from asymptomatic patients to patients who develop ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  The clinical presentation and the natural history of LVNC are highly variable, ranging from no symptoms to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic thromboemboli.  The clinical manifestations of the disease are variable, ranging from no symptoms to signs of heart failure, systemic emboli, and ventricular arrhythmias.

5e5015436d0a277941000037	Which are the databases for intrinsic protein disorders?	A comprehensive assessment of long intrinsic protein disorder from the DisProt database. Intrinsic disorder (ID), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput. Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.Results: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.Availability and implementation: The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/. MobiDB: a comprehensive database of intrinsic protein disorder annotations. Disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous processes within an organism and to the determination of a protein's biological role. The most common source for protein disorder annotations, DisProt, covers only a fraction of the available sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures. Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding the content provided by already existing sources. In addition to the DisProt and PDB X-ray structures, we have added experimental information from NMR structures and five different flavours of two disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit manual annotations through a submission form. MobiDB features experimental annotations for 17 285 proteins, covering the entire PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database, with 565 200 annotated sequences.

52eea509c8da89891000000d	Which genes are affected in ROMANO-WARD syndrome?	Long QT syndrome (LQTS) 1 is the most common type of inherited LQTS and is linked to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.  This report describes a three-generation family with a severe phenotype of long-QT syndrome-1 (LQTS-1) caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the KQT-like, voltage-gated potassium channel-1 gene (KCNQ1; MIM 607542). Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, account for the most common form of LQTS, LQTS1.  Nine patients were diagnosed with LQT1 and nine with LQT2. The other six individuals were healthy, with no symptoms characteristic for prolonged QT syndrome, but came from families with confirmed disease occurrence. The study was conducted on members of four families. In order to search for mutations (using mSSCP and sequencing), genomic DNA was obtained from patients to determine the expression levels of the genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (HERG), involved in the occurrence of clinical signs of disease. Diagnosis of RWS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or molecular genetic testing of the genes known to be associated with RWS, of which KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), KCNH2 (locus name LQT2) and SCN5A (locus name LQT3) are the most common. Other, less frequently involved genes are KCNE1 (locus name LQT5), KCNE2 (locus name LQT6), CAV3 (locus name LQT9), SCN4B (locus name LQT10), AKAP9 (locus name LQT11), SNTA1 (locus name LQT12) and KCNJ5 (locus name LQT13). Type-1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1) is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene. Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition.  Mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS. Genetic studies have identified mutations in six ion channel genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 and the accessory protein Ankyrin-B gene, to be responsible for this disorder.  Seven family members were carriers of two amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1.  KCNQ1 (formerly called KVLQT1) is a Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel gene responsible for the LQT1 sub-type of LQTS. Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2. It usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome). The primary defect in LQT1 is a mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+ channel.  Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (LQTS) that predisposes affected individuals to sudden death from tachyarrhythmias. We investigated the molecular basis of LQTS in a Taiwanese kindred. Clinical and genetic analyses revealed that a mutation was linked to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9) The cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is also mutated in some Romano-Ward cases to produce defects in INa, the cardiac inward Na+ current.  These findings provide the first evidence for a recessive form of the Romano-Ward long-QT syndrome and indicate that homozygous mutations on KVLQT1 do not invariably produce the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.

NS is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene and to the consequent lack of expression of its encoded protein LEKTI in the skin and all stratified epithelial tissues. Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, life-threatening ichthyosiform syndrome caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 gene encoding lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), a serine protease inhibitor expressed in the most differentiated epidermal layers and crucial for skin barrier function. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a debilitating congenital skin disorder caused by mutations in the SPINK5 gene encoding the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI). Loss-of-function mutations in the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor, LEKTI, encoded by the SPINK5 gene cause the rare autosomal recessive skin disease Netherton syndrome (NS).

Netherton's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) protein. We observed microstructural changes and detected LEKTI activity and SPINK5 gene mutation in three Chinese patients with Netherton's syndrome. Several skin diseases and atopic disorders including Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis have been associated with mutations and deviations of expression of SPINK5, the gene encoding the human 15-domain serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI Loss-of-function mutations in the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor, LEKTI, encoded by the SPINK5 gene cause the rare autosomal recessive skin disease Netherton syndrome (NS) Mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 5 (SPINK5) gene leading to lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) deficiency cause NS.

Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome. Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome. Here we describe the intron-exon organization of the gene and characterize the SPINK5 mutations in patients from 21 families of different geographic origin, using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. Mutation of the SPINK5 gene has been identified as disease-causing in Netherton syndrome, but the pathophysiology still remains unclear. Almost all SPINK5 mutations result in the absence of the serine-protease inhibitor LEKTI protein in both keratinocytes and lymphocytes. Several skin diseases and atopic disorders including Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis have been associated with mutations and deviations of expression of SPINK5, the gene encoding the human 15-domain serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI. Netherton&apos;s syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) protein. We observed microstructural changes and detected LEKTI activity and SPINK5 gene mutation in three Chinese patients with Netherton&apos;s syndrome. NS is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene and to the consequent lack of expression of its encoded protein LEKTI in the skin and all stratified epithelial tissues. Following the identification of the NS causative gene and protein, specific diagnostic tools have been developed, thus breaking up the challenge of distinguishing NS from other congenital ichthyoses with overlapping features, and from severe, early-onset forms of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Recently, we identified SPINK5, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI), as the defective gene in Netherton syndrome.	[['SPINK5 gene'], ['LEKTI protein']]

52f88d292059c6d71c000036	Which hormone abnormalities are common in Williams syndrome	A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy. A 31-year-old man who had been under regular hemodialysis for 6 months was diagnosed as Williams syndrome (WS) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) chromosomal analysis. The association of WS and chronic renal failure (CRF) is only rarely encountered. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted. Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels. To test the hypothesis that mutations in the calcitonin/CGRP gene might be responsible for the reduced calcitonin levels It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome Imparied calcitonin secretion in patients with Williams syndrome. in patients with Williams syndrome, we studied five such children, with intravenous calcium and parathyroid hormone infusions as provocative stimuli. These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion Our studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome. A 16-year-old male adolescent diagnosed to have the Williams-Beuren syndrome was referred to our obesity outpatient clinic, due to his morbid obesity (body mass index 39.2 kilograms per square metre) and gluttony. After several unsuccessful dietary treatments, we started therapy with sibutramine. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.   Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration;  in a population of 95 WS patients, half of them followed for more than 5 years. Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS  We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD the elevated levels of prolactin and the response of hGH to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration are indicative of a hypothalamic rather than pituitary defect. In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS  a female presenting with congenital heart defects, liver hemangiomas, and facial dysmorphisms admitted to hospital at 3 months of age because of feeding difficulties and poor growth. She had hypotonia and large tongue, "coarse" face, and umbilical hernia in presence of complex congenital cardiovascular malformations. In spite of normal neonatal screening we performed serum levels of thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin level was very high  WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher.  Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile  Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP high prevalence of impaired glucose regulation, adults with WS  Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature.

51bdb644047fa84d1d000001	Which are the known human transmembrane nucleoporins?	We investigated the interplay between import receptors and the transmembrane nucleoporin Pom121 the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. The transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1 NDC1 is a transmembrane nucleoporin that is required for NPC assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The only protein known to localize to and be important in the assembly of both of these yeast structures is the integral membrane protein, Ndc1p. However, no homologues of Ndc1p had been characterized in metazoa. Here, we identify and analyze NDC1 homologues that are conserved throughout evolution. We show that the overall topology of these homologues is conserved. Each contains six transmembrane segments in its N-terminal half and has a large soluble C-terminal half of approximately 300 amino acids. Although it is not known whether vertebrate NDC1 protein localizes to nuclear pores like its yeast counterpart, the human homologue contains three FG repeats in the C-terminus, a feature of many nuclear pore proteins. we bring together data from another study to demonstrate that the human homologue of NDC1 is the known inner nuclear membrane protein, NET3. The conserved transmembrane nucleoporin NDC1 we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans gp210 is a major constituent of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) with possible structural and regulatory roles. It interacts with components of the NPC via its C-terminal domain (CTD), which follows a transmembrane domain and a massive ( approximately 200 kDa) N-terminal region that resides in the lumen of the perinuclear space. The membrane-spanning glycoprotein gp210 is a major component of the nuclear pore complex. This nucleoporin contains a large cisternal N-terminal domain, a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and a single transmembrane segment. We propose that gp210 is organized into the pore membrane as a large array of gp210 dimers that may constitute a luminal submembranous protein skeleton. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently produce autoantibodies against gp210, an integral glycoprotein of the nuclear pores. this protein consists of three main domains: a large glycosylated lumenal domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis frequently develop autoantibodies directed to gp210, a major glycoprotein of the nuclear pore complex. This protein contains a large glycosylated cisternal domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Autoantibodies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis recognize a restricted region within the cytoplasmic tail of nuclear pore membrane glycoprotein Gp210 Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently have autoantibodies against a 210-kD integral glycoprotein of the nuclear envelope pore membrane. This protein, termed gp210, has a 1,783-amino acid amino-terminal domain located in the perinuclear space, a 20-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 58-amino acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail. We investigated the interplay between import receptors and the transmembrane nucleoporin Pom121. Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Here, we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans. Here, we report the solution structure of the human gp210 CTD as determined by various spectroscopic techniques. Using human gp210 isolated from HeLa cells we found the lumenal domain as the major target. This protein, termed gp210, has a 1,783-amino acid amino-terminal domain located in the perinuclear space, a 20-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 58-amino acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail.  In vertebrate cells, GLYCOPROTEIN OF 210 kD (gp210), PORE MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF 121 kD (Pom121), and NUCLEAR DIVISION CYCLE1 (NDC1) have been identified as integral pore membrane proteins (Cronshaw et al., 2002).

530cf4e0c8a0b4a00c000004	Which mutations of alpha-myosin heavy chain gene are implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	Accordingly, pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was induced in 2-month-old, male mice with and without a FHC (R403Q) mutation in α-myosin heavy chain. This model (designated TnI-203/MHC-403) was generated by crossbreeding mice with the Gly203Ser cardiac troponin I (TnI-203) and Arg403Gln alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC-403) FHC-causing mutations.  Male but not female mice carrying a single R403Q missense allele for cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) and F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+), respectively) develop significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) compared with male and female wild-type mice (M-alphaMHC(+/+) and F-alphaMHC(+/+), respectively) after approximately 30 wk of age. A Q1065H mutation was detected in 1 of 21 HCM probands and was absent in 2 unaffected offspring. To understand further the pathogenesis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we determined how the cardiomyopathy induced by an Arg403-->Gln missense mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (403) is affected by chronically enhancing sympathetic drive by mating the mice with those overexpressing G(s)alpha (G(s)alpha x403).  A mouse model of FHC resulting from a mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy-chain (Arg403Gln) was used to study the electrophysiologic phenotype of this disease. We used small-amplitude (0.25%) length-perturbation analysis to examine the mechanical properties of skinned left ventricular papillary muscle strips from mouse hearts bearing the R403Q mutation in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alphaMHC403/+). Genetically-manipulated mice harboring an alpha-myosin heavy chain Arg403Gln missense mutation (alpha-MHC403/+) display a phenotype characteristic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). A new mouse cardiac electrophysiology method was used to study mice harboring an alpha-myosin heavy chain Arg403Gln missense mutation (alpha-MHC403/+), which results in histological and hemodynamic abnormalities characteristic of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) and sudden death of uncertain etiology during exercise.  The introduction of the mouse model for FHC (the mouse expresses predominantly alpha-MHC as opposed to the beta-isoform in larger mammals) created a new paradigm for FHC based on finding enhanced motor function for R403Q alpha-MHC. A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) was generated by the introduction of an Arg 403 --> Gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. Biochemical analysis of one FHC mutant (Arg-249-->Gln) demonstrates that the structures formed by the mutant are solubilized at a lower ionic strength than those formed by wild-type MHC. We conclude that although the FHC mutant MHC is not labile, its assembly properties may be impaired.	[['R403Q', 'Arg403Gln'], ['Q1065H'], ['Arg-249-->Gln']]
534df8c9aeec6fbd07000016	List diseases where protein citrullination plays an important role.	his modification has been linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Over the past decade, PADs and protein citrullination have been commonly implicated as abnormal pathological features in neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and rheumatoid arthritis.  These findings suggest that PAD2 and citrullinated proteins may play a key role in the brain pathology of prion diseases.  We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression.  recent advances have shown that the once obscure modification known as citrullination is involved in the onset and progression of inflammatory diseases and cancer. These observations may reflect a role of P. gingivalis in the protein citrullination, which is related to the pathogenesis of RA. Protein citrullination has been detected in the CNS and associated with a number of neurological diseases. Protein and peptide citrullination are important in the development of rheumatoid arthritis citrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease.  Our data thus suggest that autoantibody formation in response to citrullinated vimentin directly induces bone loss, providing a link between the adaptive immune system and bone. citrullinated protein also has a negative side, because this protein's accumulation in the brain is a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease.  The aim of the present work was to study the effect of tobacco smoking on disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis patients and its relation to anti-cyclical citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullination we have reported pathological characterization of PAD2 and citrullinated proteins in scrapie-infected mice,  aberrant citrullinated proteins could play a role in pathogenesis and have value as a marker for the postmortem classification of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously reported that abnormal protein citrullination by PAD2 has been closely associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and prion disease This study suggests that accumulated citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of PAD2 may function in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and serve as potential therapeutic targets. PTMs such as citrullination due to alterations of peptidylarginine deiminase activity or generation of RA-specific epitopes, should be considered as a trigger in tolerance break. Protein citrullination is an important posttranslational modification recognized by rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-specific autoantibodies.  Protein citrullination, a once-obscure post-translational modification (PTM) of peptidylarginine, has recently become an area of significant interest because of its suspected role in human disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and also because of its newfound role in gene regulation. he increased levels of citrullinated CNS proteins associated with MS are also observed during the development of EAE.  Rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are examples of human diseases where protein citrullination involvement has been demonstrated citrullinated proteins may become a useful marker for human neurodegenerative diseases.

5cf0f567a49efeb44c00000b	Which are the main G1/S transcription factors in yeast?	To understand how commitment to cell division in late G1 phase (Start) is controlled by growth and nutrients in budding yeast, we determined the absolute concentrations of the G1/S transcription factors SBF (composed of Swi4 and Swi6) and MBF (composed of Mbp1 and Swi6), the transcriptional repressor Whi5, and the G1 cyclins, Cln1 and Cln2, in single live yeast cells using scanning number and brightness (sN&B) microscopy. We previously isolated the SKN7 gene in a screen designed to isolate new components of the G1-S cell cycle transcription machinery in budding yeast. We have now found that Skn7 associates with Mbp1, the DNA-binding component of the G1-S transcription factor DSC1/MBF To gain more insight into the G(1)/S circuitry, we characterized Swi6p, Swi4p and Mbp1p, the closest orthologues of SBF (Swi6p and Swi4p) and MBF (Swi6p and Mbp1p) components in S. cerevisiae The G(1)/S transition is a critical control point for cell proliferation and involves essential transcription complexes termed SBF and MBF in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or MBF in Schizosaccharomyces pombe In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G1/S transcription factors MBF and SBF regulate a large family of genes important for entry to the cell cycle and DNA replication and repair.   MBF and SBF consist of a common component, Swi6, and a DNA-specific binding protein, Mbp1 and Swi4, respectively. Over 200 G1/S genes are regulated by either one of the two TF complexes, SBF and MBF, which bind to specific DNA binding sequences, SCB and MCB, respectively.

515c4f05298dcd4e51000006	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 regulate in the heart?	A group of mice was treated with debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a selective TRα1 inhibitor (AMI-DBD) Furthermore, AMI resulted in β-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB). The latter further declined in AMI-DBD mainly due to increased expression of PLB We identified that mice expressing the mutant TRalpha1R384C (TRalpha1+m mice) displayed a mild bradycardia, which becomes more pronounced during night activity or on stress and is accompanied by a reduced expression of nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2 mRNA in the heart KCNE1 was four to 10-fold overexpressed in mice deficient in TRalpha1 The bradycardia and prolonged QT(end) time in hypothyroid states can be explained by altered K(+) channel function due to decreased TRalpha1-dependent repression of KCNE1 expression Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f) current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels. T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation. PE, in the absence of T3, resulted in 5.0 fold increase in TRalpha1 expression in nucleus and 2.0 fold decrease in TRalpha1 expression in cytosol, P<0.05. As a result, a fetal pattern of myosin isoform expression with marked expression of beta-MHC was observed in PE treated vs the untreated cells, P<0.05. PKC alpha overexpression in cardiomyocytes caused marked repression of triiodothyronine (T3)-responsive genes, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated adenosinetriphosphatase SERCA2. Treatment with T3 for 4 h resulted in significant reductions of PKC alpha in nuclear and cytosolic compartments, and decreased TR alpha1 mRNA and protein, with normalization of phenotype. The mechanism of TH and TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38 Excised TRalpha(1)+/m hearts showed an increased expression of phospholamban (PLB) administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), lpha-Myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) decreased in DRON while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT. The activity of TR DNA binding to the transcriptional regulatory region in the alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes and the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the heart and plasma 3,3'-triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were altered in association with changes in the myocardial TR protein levels. addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, and TRalpha1 to alpha-MyHC transcription and increased myocyte size OBJECTIVE: The reduced heart rate and prolonged QT(end) duration in mice deficient in thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1 may involve aberrant expression of the K(+) channel alpha-subunit KCNQ1 and its regulatory beta-subunit KCNE1.

51600ab3298dcd4e51000036	Which are the most commonly reported pathological states associated with the formation of DNA G-quadruplexes?	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n/(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9ORF72 gene Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological change in a variety of heart diseases contributing to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. Up-regulating relaxin expression by G-quadruplex interactive ligand to achieve antifibrotic action Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin. We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the first cleavage step in the proteolysis of the APP to the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), a process involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease Anti-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein APP by α-secretase prevents formation of the amyloid-β peptide, which accumulates in senile plaques of Alzheimer disease patients. α-Secretase belongs to the family of a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs), and ADAM10 is the primary candidate for this anti-amyloidogenic activity Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a G-rich region between nucleotides 66 and 94 of the ADAM10 5'-UTR forms a highly stable, intramolecular, parallel G-quadruplex secondary structure under physiological conditions FANCJ helicase defective in Fanconia anemia and breast cancer unwinds G-quadruplex DNA to defend genomic stability.

58e7a1393e8b6dc87c00000b	Which gene mutations are predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients?	Genetic Variations in Pattern Recognition Receptor Loci Are Associated with Anti-TNF Response in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095) homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024).  Variation at FCGR2A and functionally related genes is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in rheumatoid arthritis We aimed to validate this genetic association in a patient cohort from the Spanish population, and also to identify new genes functionally related to FCGR2A that are also associated with anti-TNF response. A total of 348 RA patients treated with an anti-TNF therapy were included and genotyped for FCGR2A polymorphism rs1081274.  Using gene expression profiles from macrophages obtained from synovial fluid of RA patients, we searched for genes highly correlated with FCGR2A expression. We found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to adalimumab (P=0.022). Analyzing the subset of anti-CCP positive RA patients (78%), we also found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to infliximab (P=0.035). DHX32 and RGS12 were the most consistently correlated genes with FCGR2A expression in RA synovial fluid macrophages (P<0.001). We found a significant association between the genetic variation at DHX32 (rs12356233, corrected P=0.019) and a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to adalimumab (rs4690093, uncorrected P=0.040).

5547d700f35db75526000007	Which are the major types of the motor speech disorder dysarthria?	Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility. There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. address voice problems of stroke patients with mixed dysarthria Characterizing intonation deficit in motor speech disorders: an autosegmental-metrical analysis of spontaneous speech in hypokinetic dysarthria, ataxic dysarthria ataxic dysarthria (AT) Acoustic analysis provides objective quantitative measures of speech that enable a comprehensive and accurate understanding of motor disorders and complement the traditional measures. This paper aims to distinguish between normal and pathological speech, more specifically between apraxia of speech and spastic dysarthria Long-term phonatory instability in ataxic dysarthria. The objective of this study is to evaluate phonation in ataxic dysarthria and a control group of normal speakers Dysprosody is a common feature in speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria. The prosodic profile of Cantonese speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria is similar to those of other languages (for example, English). Classification of dysarthria types comprises flaccid, spastic, ataxic, hypo- and hyperkinetic and mixed dysarthria. Dysarthria affects linguistic domains such as respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance and prosody due to upper motor neuron, lower motor neuron, cerebellar or extrapyramidal tract lesions. The dysarthria types were spastic (15 subjects), flaccid (10), mixed (12), hypokinetic (12), hyperkinetic (9) and ataxic (8).

5c34a761da8336e21a000005	Which metabolic pathways have been associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?	Measurement of urine neopterin, product of a metabolic pathway controlled by interferon-gamma, has been found useful in many clinical conditions.  The objective of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in estrogen metabolic pathway genes, including estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and aromatase (CYP19A1), and risk of SLE. According to the analysis on metabolic pathway, SLE could cause significant changes in unsaturated fatty acid and amino acid metabolism pathway Together, our results suggest reducing FLI1 in lupus decreases the pathogenicity of T cells by decreasing TCR-specific activation and IL-4 production in part through the modulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism genetic polymorphisms of the xenobiotic metabolic pathway involved in estrogen metabolism might contribute towards pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) The current study was conducted to elucidate the effect of genetic variations in one-carbon metabolism on the epigenetic regulation of major histocompatibility complex II transactivator (MHC2TA), reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1/SLC19A1) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Putatively functional polymorphisms of one-carbon and xenobiotic metabolic pathways influence susceptibility for wide spectrum of diseases. The current study was aimed to explore gene-gene interactions among these two metabolic pathways in four diseases i.e. breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), coronary artery disease (CAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).  In this regard, inflammation is not only associated with systemic lupus patients but is also present in patients with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

5e52900d6d0a277941000041	PH motifs in which genes endow breast cancer growth?	Although emerging roles of protease-activated receptor1&2 (PAR1&2) in cancer are recognized, their underlying signalling events are poorly understood. Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 that are critical for breast cancer growth. This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs. Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains. PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind the PH domain, reduces mammary tumours and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes. PH motifs in PAR1&2 endow breast cancer growth. Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 that are critical for breast cancer growth. The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2.

54df69af1388e8454a000005	Which drugs are included in the FEC-75 regimen?	Fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC-75) followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab followed by FEC-75 plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (Z1041): a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment received fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC-75) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) once per week for 12 weeks, while those randomly assigned to the concurrent treatment group received paclitaxel and trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of FEC-75 (on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and once-weekly trastuzumab, in the same doses as the sequential group. In May 2008, the patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy consisting of 4 courses of FEC 75(fluororracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Stage II-IIIC HER2-positive breast cancer patients, including inflammatory disease, were treated with weekly-trastuzumab for 24 weeks administered concurrently with all primary chemotherapy containing paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks and 4 cycles of FEC-75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicine 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) followed by surgery.  Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.  BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe cardiac toxicity.  Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles).  The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles. Sixty chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of 30 to 71 years in age, P.S. = 0-1, receiving 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC 75) q 21 days or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 120 mg/m2 epirubicin or high dose mitomycin-methotrexate-mitoxantrone (MMM) q 14 days (+ G-CSF) or 100 mg/m2 epirubicin (+ G-CSF) were randomized to receive, 15 min before chemotherapy, 8 mg i.v. bolus of ondansetron or 3 mg i.v. granisetron or 5 mg i.v. tropisetron and no further antiemetic therapy in the following days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization. The aim of this study, using a Fleming single-stage design, was to explore the efficacy and safety of Taxotere 100 x mg x m(-2) docetaxel and FEC 75 cyclophosphamide 500 mg x m(-2), fluorouracil 500 x mg x m(-2) and epirubicin 75 mg x m(-2), in alternating and sequential schedules for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75).

5c6b15467c78d69471000024	Mention computational tools that have been developed for alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites analysis	TAPAS: tool for alternative polyadenylation site analysis. We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly. PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants. Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response. IntMAP toolbox is available at http://compbio.cs.umn.edu/IntMAP/.

51740da48ed59a060a000024	Which are the bioinformatics tools for gene structure prediction? 	The prediction of the complete structure of genes is one of the very important tasks of bioinformatics, especially in eukaryotes. A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence. This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into 'exon-intron' (EI), 'intron-exon' (IE) or 'None' (N) boundary classes. The proposed WPSS method poses efficient results compared with the performance of many methods proposed in the literature. SCGPred: a score-based method for gene structure prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Moreover, computational gene finding in newly sequenced genomes is especially a difficult task due to the absence of a training set of abundant validated genes. Here we present a new gene-finding program, SCGPred, to improve the accuracy of prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Therefore, SCG-Pred can serve as an alternative gene-finding tool for newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes. The program is freely available at http://bio.scu.edu.cn/SCGPred/. Incorporation of splice site probability models for non-canonical introns improves gene structure prediction in plants. We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy. Source code for the updated versions of GeneSeqer and SplicePredictor (distributed with the GeneSeqer code) isavailable at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/bioinformatics2go/gs/download.html.

A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the precise exon-intron boundaries, i.e. the splice sites, in the coding region. Software (a program called DGSplicer) and datasets used are available at http://csrl.ee.nthu.edu.tw/bioinf/ BACKGROUND: cclu@ee.nthu.edu.tw. Gene structure prediction from consensus spliced alignment of multiple ESTs matching the same genomic locus. Accurate gene structure annotation is a challenging computational problem in genomics. The splice site prediction tool (SplicePredictor) is distributed with the GeneSeqer code. A SplicePredictor web server is available at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/sp.cgi We have developed a software tool, Transcript Assembly Program (TAP), to delineate gene structures using genomically aligned EST sequences. GeneBuilder: interactive in silico prediction of gene structure. In the case of low homology, GeneBuilder is still able to predict the gene structure. The GeneBuilder system has been tested by using the standard set (Burset and Guigo, Genomics, 34, 353-367, 1996) and the performances are: 0.89 sensitivity and 0.91 specificity at the nucleotide level. The computer program SeqHelp organizes information from database searches, gene structure prediction, and other information to generate multiply aligned, hypertext-linked reports to allow for fast analysis of molecular sequences. Identification of human gene structure using linear discriminant functions and dynamic programming. Development of advanced technique to identify gene structure is one of the main challenges of the Human Genome Project. A gene structure prediction system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition functions. Analysis of uncharacterized human sequences based on our methods for splice site (HSPL, RNASPL), internal exons (HEXON), all type of exons (FEXH) and human (FGENEH) and bacterial (CDSB) gene structure prediction and recognition of human and bacterial sequences (HBR) (to test a library for E. coli contamination) is available through the University of Houston, Weizmann Institute of Science network server and a WWW page of the Human Genome Center at Baylor College of Medicine. In the bioinformatics field, many computer algorithmic and data mining technologies have been developed for gene prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, sequence analysis, and protein folding predictions, to name a few.

51475d5cd24251bc0500001b	Where is X-ray free electron laser used?	In conjunction with the XFEL temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage. We discuss the pertinent physics of the intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the timescales of collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of biological systems, material science investigations, and the study of matter in extreme conditions. employment of "exotic" systems, such as the Free Electron LASER (FEL), that are expected to focus on the fundamental processes of life, following chemical reactions and biological processes as they happen, on unprecedented time and size scales. New data analysis approaches are outlined for the correlated fluctuations in fast WAXS, for protein nanocrystals just a few molecules on a side, and for the continuous x-ray scattering from a single virus Research opportunities and techniques are reviewed for the application of hard x-ray pulsed free-electron lasers (XFEL) to structural biology. These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump--probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. The use of femtosecond exposure times, rather than freezing of samples, as a means of minimizing radiation damage is shown to open up new opportunities for the molecular imaging of biochemical reactions at room temperature in solution New opportunities for solving the phase problem for XFEL data are outlined. A summary of the latest results is given, which now extend to atomic resolution for nanocrystals. Possibilities for time-resolved chemistry using fast WAXS (solution scattering) from mixtures is reviewed, toward the general goal of making molecular movies of biochemical processes. Molecular imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers. The recent development of X-ray free-electron laser sources has created new opportunities for the structural analysis of protein nanocrystals. X-ray free electron lasers hold the promise of enabling atomic-resolution diffractive imaging of single biological molecules. The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales. In this paper we report room temperature X-ray diffraction data of PS II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort (< 50 fs) 9 keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac Coherent Light Source. High-resolution protein structure determination by serial femtosecond crystallography We applied serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals (less than 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer by 3 micrometers) of the well-characterized model protein lysozyme. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. Here we recorded interpretable diffraction data from micrometer-sized lipidic sponge phase crystals of the Blastochloris viridis photosynthetic reaction center delivered into an X-FEL beam Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Single mimivirus particles intercepted and imaged with an X-ray laser Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources. With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. Diffractive imaging using the intense and coherent beam of X-ray free-electron lasers opens new perspectives for structural studies of single nanoparticles and biomolecules. The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination. Where possible we also highlight areas that we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane protein structural biology community. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) deliver short (<100 fs) and intense (∼10(12) photons) pulses of hard X-rays, making them excellent sources for time-resolved studies. Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. In single-particle coherent x-ray diffraction imaging experiments, performed at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), samples are exposed to intense x-ray pulses to obtain single-shot diffraction patterns. The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the "diffraction-before-destruction" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Ultrashort X-ray pulses from free-electron laser X-ray sources make it feasible to conduct small- and wide-angle scattering experiments on biomolecular samples in solution at sub-picosecond timescales. The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage destroys the sample. The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains largely unsolved. Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from x-ray free-electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data, or both. By combining serial nanocrystallography with x-ray free-electron laser sources in the future, it may be possible to produce molecular-resolution electron-density maps using membrane protein crystals that contain only a few hundred or thousand unit cells. Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the principle of collect and destroy.

Classically, a triad of symptoms includes sweating, palpitations, and headache. The triad of diaphoresis, tachycardia, and headache in hypertensive patients is highly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. A very few symptoms were specific, like the triad "headaches, sweating, palpitations" whose onlyone third of patients was concerned by. We noticed, like others, when the triad of headache, sweating and palpitations is accompanied by hypertension, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be made with specify and sensitivity over 93%.

Mitochondria lacking mitofilin, the large core subunit of MINOS, The mitochondrial inner membrane contains a large protein complex crucial for membrane architecture, the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS).  To study if outer membrane interactions and maintenance of cristae morphology are directly coupled, we generated mutant forms of mitofilin/Fcj1 (formation of crista junction protein 1), a core component of MINOS.  The C-terminal domain of Fcj1 is required for formation of crista junctions and interacts with the TOB/SAM complex in mitochondria.

5324cf139b2d7acc7e00001f	List the off-label use of SSRIs	The present analysis evaluates the prevalence and medication use in inpatients with depression during childhood and adolescence Fluoxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently prescribed substances. Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed. CONCLUSION: A reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives. Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common sexual dysfunction affecting 20% to 30% of men worldwide Treatment of PE typically involves pharmacotherapy, particularly when lifelong. Although there are numerous reports on the off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other compounds, only 2 treatments have been evaluated in randomized controlled phase 3 clinical trials: PSD502 and dapoxetine (SSRI) Drug therapy of fibromyalgia syndrome. Systematic review, meta-analysis and guideline]. Amitriptyline and-in case of comorbid depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder-duloxetine are recommended. Off-label use of duloxetine and pregabalin can be considered in case of no comorbid mental disorder. Trazodone is an antidepressant belonging to the class of serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression. Insomnia is the most frequent reason for prescription of trazodone. It has also been proven useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Other off-label uses include the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine/alcohol dependence, fibromyalgia, central nervous system degenerative diseases (behavioral disorders in dementia and other organic disorders), schizophrenia, chronic pain disease and diabetic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction. symptoms of vasomotor dysregulation (hot flashes) associated with the menopausal transition and sex hormone deprivation. Implication of changes in central neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of hot flashes has prompted the off-label use of serotonergic and γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic drugs as a therapeutic alternative, Sertraline was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depressive disorder, followed by fluvoxamine and tianeptine. Fluvoxamine was the most prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of anxiety disorders and mixed disorders of emotions and conduct. Off-label prescribing of antidepressants was found in 85.6% of young patients. Our results suggest that duloxetine is a possible alternative treatment of postprostatectomy established stress urinary incontinence. Pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia. different classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action are used off-label, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose, ymptomatic therapy for patients with erectile dysfunction. a oral daily off label use therapy with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline) can be offered. Without the Food and Drug Administration approval, dapoxetine, as well as other SSRIs in PE, is an off-label drug for PE. the treatment of PE consists of primarily off-label use of oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) via either on-demand or daily delivery.  The results of this off-label use show that Duloxetine is effective in men with SUI after prostate surgery even if standard pelvic floor exercises have failed. Preliminary results on the off-label use of duloxetine for the treatment of stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy or cystectomy. the number of children and adolescents whose visits involved prescription of antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, has increased markedly through 2002. Although fluoxetine remained the most commonly prescribed, other SSRIs were increasingly prescribed through 2002. These trends raise concerns regarding the widespread off-label use of antidepressants lacking reliable evidence of safety and efficacy for use in children and adolescents. Given the presumed efficacy of these new compounds and the off-label use of the current SSRIs, one might conclude that psychotherapy\behavior therapy for rapid ejaculation is an obsolete and antiquated intervention The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and breast-feeding: The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy or lactation is, to date, not promoted because of lack of safety documentation. However, the off-label use of these drugs has been common for several years. In the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often preferred over tricyclic antidepressants because of their relatively few adverse effects and safety in overdose.  The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia.

517137c18ed59a060a000001	In which proteins is the chromodomain present?	Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 affects the repair of X-ray and UV-induced DNA damage. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD) belong to a group of highly conserved chromatin remodeling proteins that are implicated in regulation of transcription. In an effort to understand the physiological role of one of the CHD members in a mammalian model system, we developed a mutant mouse model for the Chd2 gene. Crystal structure of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) DNA-binding domain in complex with DNA. Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. In suvh4 suvh5 suvh6 and cmt3 mutants, H3K9me2 associated with lacO repeats is diminished, but homologous pairing persists. Mutations in CHD7, the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, are present in 60-80% of individuals with the CHARGE syndrome. Chromodomain is present in the integrase structures of blastopia and 412 subgroup LTR-retrotransposons and may facilitate the process of non-specific integration. The CHARGE syndrome is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome that usually results from deletion or heterozygous loss of function mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene at 8q12.1. A causative mutation within the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 gene, which plays an important role in the embryonic development, is present in 2/3 of affected patients. CHD1 is a subfamily member of the CHD family, which possesses a chromodomain, a helicase domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The chromatin organizer modifier domain (chromodomain) is present in proteins that contribute to chromatin organization and mediates their binding to methylated histone H3. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory. Here we identify the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) as a novel coregulator of androgen-responsive transcription. Mutations in CHD7, a chromodomain gene, are present in a majority of individuals with CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly disorder characterized by ocular Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia and Ear anomalies. Two new chromodomain-containing proteins that associate with heterochromatin in Sciara coprophila chromosomes. Both proteins, ScoHET1 of 37 kDa and ScoHET2 of 44 kDa, display two chromodomain motifs that contain the conserved residues essential for the recognition of methylated histone H3 at lysine 9. In this study, we present a detailed histomorphologic characterization of mice containing a mutation in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (Chd2). Specificity of the chromodomain Y chromosome family of chromodomains for lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs. Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. We assessed mRNA transcript abundance of seven genes that code for proteins with established roles in epigenetically-mediated gene silencing [transcriptional co-repressor SIN3A, DNA (cytosine-5-) methyltransferase 1, methyl CpG binding protein 2, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4, histone binding protein rbbp4, histone deacetylase 1 and nuclear receptor co-repressor 2] using qRT-PCR. CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes. The cysteine-rich CXXC domains of MBD1 bound to Ring1b and the chromodomain of hPc2. Methylation of lysine 9 within histone H3 and the subsequent binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are thought to initiate heterochromatin formation in vivo and to propagate a heterochromatic state lasting through several cell divisions. Here, we show that the SNF2-like chromodomain helicase protein CHD8 interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF. C The chromodomain (CD) of the Drosophila Polycomb protein exhibits preferential binding affinity for histone H3 when trimethylated at lysine 27. Despite a high degree of conservation, the Cbx chromodomains display significant differences in binding preferences. Three-dimensional solution structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43. Recently, three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs) have been identified in cpSRP43. The C-terminal helical segment typically found in the nuclear chromodomains is absent in CD1. Critical comparison of the structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43 with those found in nuclear chromodomain proteins revealed that the diverse protein-protein interactions mediated by the CDs appear to stem from the differences that exist in the surface charge potentials of each CD. Characterization and functional analysis of CReMM, a novel chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein. The present study describes a newly identified protein named CReMM (chromatin-related mesenchymal modulator). The protein was studied by bioinformatic means and classified as a member of the third subfamily of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD). In silico translation defined CReMM as a multiple domains protein including two chromodomains, SNF2/ATPase, helicase C domain and an A/T-DNA-binding domain (DBD). Identification and analysis of chromodomain-containing proteins encoded in the mouse transcriptome. The chromodomain is 40-50 amino acids in length and is conserved in a wide range of chromatic and regulatory proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. Chromodomain-containing proteins can be classified into families based on their broader characteristics, in particular the presence of other types of domains, and which correlate with different subclasses of the chromodomains themselves. Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions. In addition to the canonical MYST HAT catalytic domain, both TgMYST-A and -B possess an atypical C2HC zinc finger and a chromodomain. Clr7 and Clr8 are required for localization of the Swi6 chromodomain protein and for histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, thereby influencing not only mating-type switching but also transcriptional silencing in all previously characterized heterochromatic regions, chromosome segregation, and meiotic recombination in the mating-type region. MRG15, a novel chromodomain protein, is present in two distinct multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional activation. MRG15 is a novel chromodomain protein that is a member of a family of genes related to MORF4. MORF4 (mortality factor on chromosome 4) induces senescence in a subset of human tumor cell lines. Analysis of deletion mutants of MRG15 indicated that the leucine zipper at the C-terminal region of MRG15 was important for the protein associations in MAF1 and that the N-terminal chromodomain was required for the assembly of the MAF2 protein complex. Consistent with these data was the fact that a histone acetyltransferase activity associated with MRG15 was lost when the chromodomain was deleted and that both mutant MRG15 proteins failed to activate the B-myb promoter. The various mechanisms by which MRG15 could activate gene transcription are discussed. The chromodomain (CD) is a highly conserved motif present in a variety of animal and plant proteins, and its probable role is to assemble a variety of macromolecular complexes in chromatin. Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tail. The chromodomain of the HP1 family of proteins recognizes histone tails with specifically methylated lysines. Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing. The histone tail inserts as a beta strand, completing the beta-sandwich architecture of the chromodomain. The methylammonium group is caged by three aromatic side chains, whereas adjacent residues form discerning contacts with one face of the chromodomain. The MORF4-Related Gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) is a member of a novel family of genes originally identified in studies to reveal cell senescence-inducing factors. MRG15 contains several predicted protein motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, a leucine zipper, and a chromodomain. Four alleles of dMi-2 mutants were further characterized in molecular nature; dMi-2(BL1) was found to have a mutation in the ATP-binding motif of the ATPase domain, dMi-2(BL7) in the core histidine of the first plant homeodomain zinc finger and dMi-2(BL12) in a conserved serine in the chromodomain. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus. CHD1 interacts with SSRP1 and depends on both its chromodomain and its ATPase/helicase-like domain for proper association with chromatin. Interaction between an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane and human chromodomain proteins homologous to Drosophila HP1. A mammalian DNA-binding protein that contains a chromodomain and an SNF2/SWI2-like helicase domain. A Southern blot analysis indicated that this protein, which we have named CHD-1, for chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein, is present in most, if not all, mammalian species. Here we show that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) forms a complex with Gata3 in Th2 cells that both activates Th2 cytokine transcription and represses the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the defining subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is a nucleosome-remodeling protein of the SNF2/ISWI2 family, members of which contain two chromo domains and an ATP-dependent helicase module. Among those proteins with >40% regulation were Macrophage Capping protein (CAPG) and Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins which were significantly upregulated by pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H overexpression. This heterochromatin coordinates expression levels by associating with a chromodomain protein Chp1 and an antisilencing factor Epe1. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT. Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a tumor suppressor mapping to 1p36, a genomic region that is frequently deleted in human cancer. Here, we identify ENHANCED PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (EPP1), previously known as PICKLE (PKL), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor of the chromodomain/helicase/DNA binding family, as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromodomain on Y-like (CDYL) is a chromodomain protein that has sequence homology to members of the enoyl CoA hydratase family. Our previous structural work demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66α) proteins recruits the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2β) to the NuRD complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M. N., Scarsdale, J. N., Amaya, M. L., Webb, H. D., Desai, M. A., Walavalkar, N. M., Wang, S. Z., Zu Zhu, S., Ginder, G. D., and Williams, D. C., Jr. (2011) p66α-MBD2 coiled-coil interaction and recruitment of Mi-2 are critical for globin gene silencing by the MBD2-NuRD complex. Sequence analysis showed that NlElp3 contains GNAT-type HAT domain and Radical SAM domain, and NlMof contains chromodomain and MOZ-SAS acetyltransferase domain. We examined requirements for individual domains of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), a core catalytic component of NuRD complexes, as well as the NuRD subunit methyl-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and methylated DNA, for NuRD function in the context of tissue-specific transcription. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase/adenosine triphosphatase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) is an SNF2-like transcription factor involved in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twelve rare copy number variants segregate with talipes equinovarus in multiplex pedigrees, and contain the developmentally expressed transcription factors and transcriptional regulators PITX1, TBX4, HOXC13, UTX, CHD (chromodomain protein)1, and RIPPLY2. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) plays a role in normal neural development and in tumorigenesis of various human cancers. The chromodomain, helicase, DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a chromatin remodeling enzyme which is implicated in tumor suppression. The methyl-mark determines a highly flexible and very dynamic interaction of the chromodomain of hHP1β with the H3-tail. To test this hypothesis, we performed a comprehensive molecular dynamics study in which we analyzed a crystallographically defined complex that involves the HP1 chromodomain and an H3 tail peptide. Whereas the molecular target of the MRG15 chromodomain (CD) has been suggested to be H3K36me(2/3), the precise molecular target of the Pf1 plant homeodomain 1 (PHD1) has remained elusive. Chp1, a chromodomain (CD) protein, forms the Ago1-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and recruits siRNA-bound RITS to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) via its CD. In addition, cells expressing S473A also displayed defective mobilization of the HP1-β chromodomain protein. CHD7 is a chromodomain-containing, ATP dependent helicase protein that is highly expressed in the developing ear and is required for semicircular canal development in both humans and mice. Moreover, the LTR retrotransposon fraction in BAC clones harboring genes is disproportionately composed of chromodomain-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons ('chromoviruses'), and the majority of the intact chromoviruses contain tandem chromodomain duplications. Stimulated by positively charged residues in the hinge region, RNA competes with methylated histone H3K9 for binding to the chromodomain of HP1(Swi6). CHD7 is one of the nine members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. Therefore, p53, ZNF237, and Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 3 inhibit the function ER Ca²⁺ leak channels to regulate both ER and cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels and may potentially control Ca²⁺-signaling function of PS1. We show that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding domain 2 (Chd2), a SNF2 chromatin remodelling enzyme family member, interacts with MyoD and myogenic gene regulatory sequences to specifically mark these loci via deposition of the histone variant H3.3 prior to cell differentiation. Analysis of the Neurospora crassa chromodomain protein CDP-2, a component of a newly characterized HP1-containing complex, reveals a second gene-silencing mechanism and provides insights into the dynamic nature of chromatin domains that possess shared components. We state that the non-tumorogenic potential of bitumen transformant in nude/SCID mice can be attributed to the downregulation of galectin-1, chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1-like gene, and membrane-associated guanylate kinase 2 protein. Mutagenesis of Tf1 integrase revealed that the complete Tf1 integrase protein (excluding its chromodomain) is required for stimulating the Tf1 RT primer removal activity. About 80% of patients with a clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Owing to different polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing events, the human CBX2 locus produces two transcripts: a 5-exon transcript that encodes the 532-amino acid CBX2-1 isoform that contains the conserved chromodomain and Pc box and a 4-exon transcript encoding a shorter isoform, CBX2-2, lacking the Pc box but still possessing a chromodomain. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) is the core catalytic subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin remodeling complex. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHD) belong to a group of highly conserved chromatin remodeling proteins that are implicated in regulation of transcription. Here, we report that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a novel BRIT1 binding partner that regulates the HR repair process. Here, we report that the chromodomain-containing protein MRG-1 is an important factor for genomic integrity in meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The chromodomain protein, Chromator, can be divided into two main domains, a NH(2)-terminal domain (NTD) containing the chromodomain (ChD) and a COOH-terminal domain (CTD) containing a nuclear localization signal. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a potent tumor suppressor that serves as a master regulator of a tumor-suppressive network. By high-resolution tiling array CGH, the smallest common deletion targeted just one gene, the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1). Here we report direct evidence for presynaptic pairing activity intrinsic to non-PC regions, which is facilitated by a conserved chromodomain protein, MRG-1. The chromodomain of MPP8 recognizes the dimethylated Dnmt3aK44me2. Members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins are thought to regulate gene expression. It has been shown that the methylation mark of vertebrate histone H1 is specifically recognized by the chromodomain of HP1. To this end, we have performed mutation studies on the Drosophila HP1α chromodomain, which binds H3K9Me(2)  and H3K9Me(3)  with approximately equal affinities. We are interested in defining which elements of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler are necessary and sufficient for sliding nucleosomes. Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent machines that dynamically alter the chromatin packaging of eukaryotic genomes by assembling, sliding, and displacing nucleosomes. Ocular coloboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies associated with deafness (CHARGE) syndrome is a rare, usually sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations within the CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene, in nearly 70% of cases. Here we report that the chromodomain-containing protein CDYL specifically recognizes di- and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) and directly interacts with EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. Murine Chd1 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1), a chromodomain-containing chromatin remodeling protein, is necessary for embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Among those genes, zinc finger helicase (ZFH), also termed chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (Chd3), was one of the highly expressed transcripts in tentative cementoblasts. UNLABELLED: Emerging evidence implicates the chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) as a specific oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigate the function of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (chd7) during zebrafish somitogenesis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain-DNA-binding-protein 7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly condition which includes vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss. BACKGROUND: The CHD5 gene located on 1p36 encodes a protein-chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5. CHD5 has been shown to be a tumor suppressor gene candidate. Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. Previously, we have shown that the chromodomain protein Chriz and the zinc-finger protein Z4 are essentially required for the maintenance of polytene chromosome structure. In brain, Family with sequence similarity 174 member b (Fam174b) had increased expression in 318 females, whereas Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (Chd2-2) had reduced expression in 318 males. RESULTS: Here we demonstrated that chromobox protein homolog 3 (Cbx3) is crucial for SMC differentiation from stem cells and that the chromodomain and chromoshadow domain of Cbx3 are responsible for Cbx3-induced SMC differentiation. Fractionation of the extract identified a single protein, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (Chd1), capable of the remodeling activity. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) has been found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in malignant neural tumors. Similarly, CenH3-GFP distribution was altered in the absence of HP1, the chromodomain protein that binds to H3K9me3. ChIP-Seq reveals that KDM5B is predominantly targeted to intragenic regions and that it is recruited to H3K36me3 via an interaction with the chromodomain protein MRG15. OBJECTIVE: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) is a regulator of the chromatin remodelling process. We determined the crystal structure of MPP8 chromodomain in complex with H3K9me3 peptide. On this gene the chromodomain protein HP1γ, frequently defined as a transcriptional repressor, facilitates inclusion of the alternative exons via a mechanism involving decreased RNA polymerase II elongation rate. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a core component of the NuRD complex and contains a nucleosome remodeling ATPase domain along with two chromodomains and two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers. H3-Lys-9-Me2 interacts with the chromodomain of Swi6/HP1. The chromodomain (CD) of HP1 proteins specifically recognizes the methyl mark on H3 peptides, but the same extent of specificity is not observed within chromatin. We have performed simulations on models of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 complexed with a variety of histone H3 modifications. CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutation in the CHD7 gene, encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7. Molecular diagnostic testing for CHD7 mutation has been available in a clinical setting since 2005. In this work we identified Kismet, a chromodomain-containing protein of the SNF2-like family of ATPases, as a novel component of the hedgehog transcriptional repression mechanism in anterior compartment cells.

5d2f3a5db3a6380763000001	Which drugs used in the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus are targeting granulocytes?	After treatment with any of the xenobiotic compounds, immunolabeling demonstrated the additional presence of granulocytes in foci, and, at electron microscope level neutrophils, eosinophils and their precursors were clearly recognizable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination in patients with ATM in the course of SLE indicate usually pleocytosis with prevalence of granulocytes, increased protein levels, low glucose levels, significantly hindering differential diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Granulocytes isolated from 17 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had a significantly increased (P less than 0.001) mean initial rate of phagocytosis (0.91 min-u).  Both syndromes were refractory to conventional treatment but responded to rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Although some Fc-independent loss of CD22 is expected from internalization by epratuzumab, the concurrent and prominent reduction of CD19, CD21, and CD79b is Fc dependent and results from their transfer from epratuzumab-opsonized B cells to FcγR-expressing monocytes, natural killer cells, and granulocytes via trogocytosis.   ANCA also occurs in 30%-40% of patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and anti-GBM disease, but is uncommon in other forms of vasculitis.

58c1b2f702b8c6095300001e	List 3 indications for Bupropion	 For genotype, genes associated with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and related proteins have been found to predict response to first-line medications (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, or varenicline) or quitting over time without a controlled treatment trial.  The approval of drug combinations, such as phentermine/topiramate and bupropion/naltrexone are also noteworthy, the components of which have been previously approved, but not necessarily for obesity as main indication. Two drugs, phentermine plus topiramate and lorcaserin, have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the indication of obesity; a third, bupropion plus naltrexone, is under consideration for approval.  Bupropion SR is preferred to subjects with depression or smokers who have failed with the previous two agents, due to the many contra-indications and side effects of bupropion SR. With one of the 3 agents combined with follow-up visits with counselling, one can expect a 1-year quit rate around 20-25%. In vitro intrinsic clearances were likewise different for bupropion enantiomers.CONCLUSIONS: Stereoselective bupropion hydroxylation may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of bupropion as an antidepressant or smoking cessation therapy, and for the use of bupropion as an in vivo phenotypic probe for CYP2B6 activity. PURPOSE: Hydroxylation of the antidepressant and smoking deterrent drug bupropion is a clinically important bioactivation and elimination pathway. Although not U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for these indications, bupropion has also been used as an adjunctive treatment to reverse antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction and to augment anti-depressant efficacy in partial responders and non-responders to other agents.Bupropion has played and will continue to play an important role as a treatment for major depressive disorder in adults, as well as for other related disorders Clinically, bupropion is used as a treatment for two indications, as an antidepressant, the indication for which it was developed, and as a tobacco use cessation agent Sustained release bupropion (amfebutamone) is a non-nicotine agent that is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation.  Bupropion was introduced for smoking cessation following a pivotal trial showing that it gave improved efficacy over the nicotine patch and also suggesting combination treatment was beneficial.  Compared with a placebo control, bupropion approximately doubles smoking quit rates.  Over the past decade, bupropion has become a major pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the Western world. Unlike other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, bupropion is a non-nicotine treatment Bupropion has been tested in over 40 controlled clinical trials and has been associated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events than NRTs.  Bupropion SR is a useful oral and non-nicotine form of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. everal new drugs for the treatment of obesity are either licensed in some parts of the world, submitted for registration, or completing phase III trials. These include combinations (at low dose) of existing drugs, e.g., bupropion + naltrexone (Contrave),	[['weight loss in obesity'], ['smoking cessation'], ['depression']]

5165932e298dcd4e51000059	Which are the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases inhibitors?	5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a nucleoside analog that can inhibit DNA cytosine methylation, possesses potent antitumorigenic activities for myeloid disorders. Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear. The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by 5-azacytosine is likely to involve methyl transfer to the inhibitor. The mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases by the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-azacytosine has remained unclear, mainly because of the unavailability of a substrate in which the inhibitor, but not normal cytosine, is present at the target site. These results suggest that, when the enzyme binds to 5-azacytosine in the presence of the cofactor, a methyl group is transferred to the N-5 position of the base, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme. Rapid synthesis of new DNMT inhibitors derivatives of procainamide. Six compounds resulted in potent inhibitors of the murine catalytic Dnmt3A/3L complex and of human DNMT1, at least 50 times greater than that of the parent compounds. The inhibitors showed selectivity for C5 DNA methyltransferases. DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase inhibition by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (zebularine aglycon) at the enzymatic target site. A number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine. ODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers. The inhibitory activity of hydralazine toward DNMT may be rationalized at the molecular level by similar interactions within the binding pocket (e.g., by a similar pharmacophore) as established by substrate-like deoxycytidine analogues. Despite the different scaffolds of other non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as procaine and procainamide, the current modeling work reveals that these drugs exhibit similar interactions within the DNMT1 binding site. These findings are valuable in guiding the rational design and virtual screening of novel DNMT inhibitors. Inhibition of HhaI DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine: examination of the intertwined roles of co-factor, target, transition state structure and enzyme conformation. The presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro. Thus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action. Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI. Zebularine: a novel DNA methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases. The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism. Synthesis of oligonucleotide inhibitors of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferase containing 5-azacytosine residues at specific sites. The incorporation of 5-azacytosine residues into DNA causes potent inhibition of DNA (Cytosine-C5) methyltransferases. T Mechanism of inhibition of DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferases by oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine. Substitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine. These results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation. Analysis of DNA methylation processes related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by 5-azacytidine in Streptomyces antibioticus ETH 7451. Our results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on DNA and RNA synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase. DNA containing 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits methylation by HhaI methyltransferase. The inhibitory effect of the 4'sulfur atom on enzymatic activity may be traced to perturbation of a step in the methylation reaction after DNA binding but prior to methyl transfer. Treatment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with the C5 DNA methyltransferase (C5Mtase) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) has previously been shown to induce G2 checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize Foxp3 expression in Tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo. Booster of pluripotency: RSC133, a new synthetic derivative of indoleacrylic acid/indolepropionic acid, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA), have recently been highlighted for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); however, their action mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Structurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to             5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen®), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor             (DNMTi). Although 5-Aza-CdR is known to be incorporated into DNA and inhibit DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antineoplastic activity remain unclear. Human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW48, SW480) were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, followed by trichostatin A (TSA), as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. With increasing 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, the expression of DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Psammaplin A (11c) is a marine metabolite previously reported to be a potent inhibitor of two classes of epigenetic enzymes: histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. Defining the parameters of zebularine-mediated tumor inhibition may advance the future development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as an effective cancer treatment. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor [trichostatin A (TSA)] both significantly up-regulated miR-146a transcriptional activation by altering the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in macrophages isolated from aged mice, which suggests that DNA methylation and histone acetylation are involved in the suppression of age-dependent miR-146a expression. Diverse DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being studied as potential anticancer drugs, and there is interest in developing novel and more effective DNMTIs. Currently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools. The effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined. Cooperative action of HDACi and DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTi) has been reported, making combined treatment an attractive choice for cancer therapy.

This study reviewed all studies about any roles of IL-4 that can directly and indirectly be played in the development of pemphigus and IL-4 inhibition with interferons and dupilumab therapy were introduced as a novel pemphigus treatment for patients who are in relapse phase of the disease. Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus. It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 α-chain receptor.  OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis. BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.  Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.  The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication "atopic dermatitis" were published in 2014. An IL-4R antagonist, dupilumab, is the first drug that shows great promise in phase II trials.  Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis.  Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor α subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways. Dupilumab inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in asthma. Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways. Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. The robust effects of dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2 cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease.

Prevalence and long-term outcome of epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is reported to be variable Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are benign tumors, most commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive, frequently lethal cystic lung disease that almost exclusively affects women. Rhabdomyoma is the most common type of cardiac tumor in fetuses and is often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with neurologic sequelae. In contrast to renal angiomyolipomas, which are often associated with tuberous sclerosis, clinical characteristics of subependymal nodule (SN) - subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SGCA) complex in tuberous sclerosis NMI patients had a lower incidence of brain findings on imaging studies, neurological features, and renal findings than those with TSC2 mutations. In contrast, NMI patients had a lower incidence of seizures than TSC patients with TSC1 mutations, but had a higher incidence of both renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. clinical characteristics of subjects with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, both sporadic and tuberous sclerosis-related forms. Women with tuberous sclerosis-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis were younger and had less impaired lung function compared with those with the sporadic form. Balloon cells are histopathological hallmarks of various cortical malformations, i.e., focal cortical dysplasia (Taylor's type, FCD IIb), hemimegalencephaly (HME) or cortical tubers (tuberous sclerosis, TSC).  Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare cause of recurrent pneumothorax and should be considered a differential diagnosis, especially in young women with diffuse bilateral bullous emphysema or tuberous sclerosis. The disease is characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous tumors: neurofibromas and angiofibromas, located in the skin, central nervous system, mucosas and other organs. Abnormal neural cell migration plays an important role in the neurological dysfunctions found in TS, the predominant features being mental retardation, seizures and behavioral disorders. The true prevalence of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is unknown. We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of patients with TSC and refractory epilepsy who started CLB over a 5-year period. Clinical characteristics and number of tubers on MRI were assessed.

517539af8ed59a060a000026	Which genes are regulated by MEF-2 in the heart?	Inhibition of MEF2A using siRNA attenuated HB-EGF-induced COX-2, ANF expression and cell size. This genetic reprogramming coincides with a pronounced increase in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha gene, which we show to be a direct MEF2 target gene cardiac calsequestrin gene (casq2) Functional studies demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sites significantly decreased the transcription of the gene in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, indicating that they are important to drive cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription of the casq2 gene. DTEF-1 also interacts with MEF- 2 by coimmunoprecipitation and independently or cooperatively (with MEF-2) trans-activates the cTnT promoter An 85-bp region within the enhancer is highly conserved between human and mouse and contains a central AT-rich site, which is essential for enhancer activity. This site binds myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 factors, principally MEF2D and MEF2A in cardiocyte nuclear extracts. These results are discussed in the context of MEF2 activity and of the regulation of the alpha-cardiac actin locus. The cis-acting elements, MEF-2, E boxes and A/T rich elements present in the enhancer region of the mouse MCK gene are known to regulate the expression of the gene The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) belong to a family of active calcium transport enzymes encoded by the SERCA1, 2, and 3 genes. In this study, we describe the complete structure of the human SERCA2 gene and its 5 -regulatory region. Among the DNA cis-elements present in these two regulatory regions there are potential binding sites for: GATA-4, -5, -6, Nkx-2.5/Csx, OTF-1, USF, MEF-2, SRF, PPAR/RXR, AP-2, and TREs. Upstream from position -1.5 kb, there is no significant homology among the SERCA2 genes cloned. The cardiac calsequestrin gene consists of 11 exons and its 5' flanking region is characterized by the presence of a TATA-like box, muscle specific promoter elements such as 7 E-boxes, 1 MEF-2, 1 MCBF and 1 Repeat (musS) motifs, as well as several muscle non-specific transcriptional elements (AP-2A, NRE1, NRE2, p53, Spel and TFI-IIA). our laboratory identified a 28 bp HF-la/MEF-2 element in the MLC-2v promoter region, which confers cardiac ventricular chamber-specific gene expression during murine cardiogenesis, In this study, we investigated T3R alpha 1-vs. T3R beta 1-specific interactions with the myocyte enhancer-specific factor-2 (MEF-2) on the expression of the SERCA 2 gene in transient transfection assays in embryonal heart-derived H9c2 cells. point to T3R isoform-specific interactions with a cell type-specific transcription factor (MEF-2) in the regulation of SERCA 2 gene expression. In multiple independent transgenic mouse lines, we found that both a 250 base pair myosin light chain-2 ventricular promoter fragment, as well as a dimerized 28 bp sub-element (HF-1) containing binding sites for HF1a and HF1b/MEF2 factors, directed ventricular-specific reporter expression from as early as the endogenous gene, at day 7.5-8.0 post coitum. Myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) regulates alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene expression in vitro and in vivo In the MLC-2 gene, an AT-rich element (HF-1b) which contains a consensus MEF-2 site is required for cardiac tissue-specific expression. Role of myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor (MEF-2) in transcriptional regulation of the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene. In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the muscle-specific subunit of the human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) gene, chimeric genes composed of the upstream region of the PGAM-M gene These observations define the PGAM-M enhancer as the only cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific enhancer characterized thus far that is mainly activated through MEF-2. Transcription of each gene is independently controlled but coordinately regulated. During each embryogenesis, the beta-MHC gene is expressed as part of the cardiac myogenic program under the control of NKX-2.5, MEF-2C, and GATA-4/5/6. We have characterized the specific DNA regulatory elements responsible for the function of the human cardiac troponin C gene (cTnC) muscle-specific enhancer in myogenic cells. We used functional transient transfection assays with deletional and site-specific mutagenesis to evaluate the role of the conserved sequence elements. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated the ability of the functional sites to interact with nuclear proteins. We demonstrate that three distinct transcription activator binding sites commonly found in muscle-specific enhancers (a MEF-2 site, a MEF-3 site, and at least four redundant E-box sites) all contribute to full enhancer activity but a CArG box does not.

5be94f3d133db5eb78000022	List 3 diseases for which saRNAs have been evaluated as a potential treatment.	Small activating RNA restores the activity of the tumor suppressor HIC-1 on breast cancer. Upon saRNA treatment, genes upregulated included those involved in immune activation, cell cycle interference, the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, and cell differentiation. Downregulated genes included oncogenes and those that play roles in cell invasion, cell growth, and cell division. We present a novel method for treating bladder cancer with intravesically delivered small activating RNA (saRNA) in an orthotopic xenograft mouse bladder tumor model.  Treatment of Liver Cancer by C/EBPA saRNA. In preclinical models of liver disease, treatment with C/EBPα saRNA has shown reduction in tumor volume and improvement in serum markers of essential liver function such as albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). This saRNA that activates C/EBPα for advanced HCC is the first saRNA therapy to have entered a human clinical trial.	[['Breast cancer'], ['Bladder cancer'], ['Liver cancer']]
5c6f107c7c78d69471000051	Which molecules are targeted by defactinib?	LC-ESI-MS/MS determination of defactinib, a novel FAK inhibitor in mice plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in mice. Effect of FAK inhibitor VS-6063 (defactinib) on docetaxel efficacy in prostate cancer. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) activation is a mediator of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the second generation FAK inhibitor VS-6063 on docetaxel efficacy in pre-clinical CRPC and CSPC models. Here, we report the development of a selective and potent Fak degrader, PROTAC-3, which outperforms a clinical candidate, defactinib, with respect to Fak activation as well as Fak-mediated cell migration and invasion.  Prompted by our observation of a correlation between PTEN loss and FAK phosphorylation in a cohort of patients with stage IV SCC, we evaluated the relevance of PTEN loss in cancer progression as well as the efficacy of a new combined treatment with the pan PI3K inhibitor buparlisip and the FAK inhibitor defactinib. PURPOSE: VS-6063 (also known as defactinib or PF-04554878) is a second-generation inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase and proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2.  OBJECTIVE: VS-6063 (also known as defactinib or PF-04554878) is a second-generation inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2).  Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4 cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397 expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells.

51656c94298dcd4e51000058	What is the inheritance pattern of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy? 	. Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait. Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance. The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that frequently presents early contractures and cardiac conduction defects, caused by emerin deficiency in the inner nuclear membrane of the muscular fibers. compatible with X-linked inheritance form The first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD. As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus. contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD. The STA gene encodes emerin and is one of the genes that is affected in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Although it has been reported that EDMD caused by the STA gene mutation is associated with X-linked recessive inheritance, the genotype-phenotype correlations, with special reference to cardiac manifestations, are not well defined. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a muscular disorder characterized by 1) early contracture of the elbows. Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles, 2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a humeroperoneal distribution, and 3) life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction block. Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy. The patient had no familial background of the disease. This patient might have a sporadic inheritance pattern with severe cardiac involvement. autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is characterized by the clinical triad of early onset contractures of elbows, Achilles tendons and spine, wasting and weakness with a predominantly humero-peroneal distribution and life-threatening cardiac conduction defects and/or cardiomyopathy. Two main types of inheritance have been described: the X-linked form is caused by mutations in the STA gene on locus Xq28 and the gene for the autosomal dominant form (LMNA gene) has been localized on chromosome 1q11-q23. Recently, mutations in this LMNA gene have been also found to be responsible for the less frequent autosomal recessive form of the disease. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by early contractures of elbows and Achilles tendons, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and a cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks which is life-threatening. Two modes of inheritance exist, X-linked (OMIM 310300) and autosomal dominant (EDMD-AD; OMIM 181350). EDMD-AD is clinically identical to the X-linked forms of the disease. Mutations in EMD, the gene encoding emerin, are responsible for the X-linked form. including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD, this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance. Seventeen families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) have been studied both by DNA sequencing and by emerin protein expression. Fourteen had mutations in the X-linked emerin gene, while three showed evidence of autosomal inheritance. Twelve of the 14 emerin mutations caused early termination of translation. One family presented a rare autosomal dominant variant of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, another with X-linked recessive inheritance showed unusual intrafamilial variability. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) is characterised by (1) early contractures of the Achilles tendons, elbows, and postcervical muscles, (2) slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness with a predominantly humeroperoneal distribution in the early stages, and (3) cardiomyopathy with conduction defects and risk of sudden death. Inheritance is usually X linked recessive but can be autosomal dominant. Tendon contractures may be a partial expression of this myopathic disorder, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. A muscular dystrophy clinically similar to that of the Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD) type can thus occur in women. Since the disease was diagnosed in 3 brothers, the X-coupled recessive type of its inheritance is assumed. An opinion is advanced that the described form is a clinical variety of Emery-Dreyfus myodystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS) the term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is a syndrome with five salient features: early and unusual contractures; humeroperoneal muscle wasting; the slow progression of weakness, beginning in childhood; cardiac conduction defects; and X-linked inheritance. We present two cases and detail other reports with a similar constellation of findings with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with proximal weakness in both the upper and lower limbs and X-linked scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy represent the same disorder. There is at least one other report of autosomal dominant transmission of this clinical picture, which had previously only been reported as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with X-linked recessive inheritance.

5149af96d24251bc05000046	Which are the state-of-the-art computational tools for the prediction of gene fusion events?	MosaicFinder: Identification of fused gene families in sequence similarity networks This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. Inference of gene function based on gene fusion events: the rosetta-stone method. The basic idea is based on the principle of "guilt by association." It is assumed that two proteins, which are found to be transcribed by a single transcript in one (or several) genomes are likely to be functionally linked, for example by acting in a same metabolic pathway or by forming a multiprotein complex. This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteins This chapter uses the FusionDB database (http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) as source of information. FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments. PLEX can be searched iteratively and also enables searches for chromosomal gene neighbors and Rosetta Stone linkages. While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison. Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters. To investigate the fidelity of gene-fusion characters, we developed an approach for identifying differentially distributed gene fusions among whole-genome datasets: fdfBLAST. Genome-scale comparative analysis of gene fusions, gene fissions Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods--chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion Pairs of genes that function together in a pathway or cellular system can sometimes be found fused together in another organism as a Rosetta Stone protein--a fusion protein whose separate domains are homologous to the two functionally-related proteins. Using the Rosetta Stone method and this scoring scheme, we find all significant functional linkages for proteins of E. coli, P. horikshii and S. cerevisiae, and measure the extent of the resulting protein networks.

589a246c78275d0c4a000032	Which 2 medications are included in the Qsymia pill?	OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements. The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. These include combinations (at low dose) of existing drugs, e.g., bupropion + naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine + topiramate (Qsymia), higher doses of existing drugs licensed for other indications (liraglutide, 3 mg), and new entities (lorcaserin). RECENT FINDINGS: Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity. Adding to the current available pharmacotherapies for obesity, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 new combination medications known as lorcaserin (Belviq) and phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). After a long period of failure in development, two new medications (phentermine/topiramate ER - Qsymia™ and lorcaserin - Belviq®) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term weight management in persons with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) or in overweight persons (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m(2)) with comorbidities. The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo Current antiobesity medications and pharmacological strategies will be reviewed.Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity.

534ab91eaeec6fbd07000012	Which genes were found to be methylated in bladder cancer cells?	CpG island in promoter of hepaCAM gene was hyper-methylated both in bladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines (T24 and BIU-87). Otherwise, aberrant methylation of its promoter was associated with its decreased expression. Abnormal hypermethylation in CpG island of hepaCAM promoter is involved in absence of hepaCAM gene expression when bladder cancer occurs. Methylated RARβ(2) and APC were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients (62.8%, 59.5%) than benign (16.4%, 5%) but not detected in healthy volunteers (0%) at (P < 0.0001). Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73.4%) showed methylated RARβ(2) and 86 (67.2%) showed methylated APC. Thus, methylated RARβ(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer. Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells. hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells. Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of hepaCAM gene was reversed and expression of its mRNA and protein were re-activated in two cell lines by DNA methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-CdR	[['hepaCAM (hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule)'], ['RARβ(2)'], ['APC'], ['TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain)'], ['RASSF1A'], ['p14(ARF)'], ['p16']]
