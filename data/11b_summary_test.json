Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.RESULTS: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GeneCodeq is available at: github.com/genecodeq/eval", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354700", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 508, "offsetInEndSection": 713, "text": "RESULTS\nWe here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354700", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 508, "offsetInEndSection": 713, "text": "RESULTS We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354700", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 311, "offsetInEndSection": 730, "text": "Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.<br><b>RESULTS</b>: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy.", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354700", "endSection": "abstract"}, {"offsetInBeginSection": 1392, "offsetInEndSection": 1718, "text": "Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.<br><b>AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION</b>: GeneCodeq is available at: github.com/genecodeq/eval CONTACT: dan@petagene.comSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.<br>", "beginSection": "abstract", "document": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354700", "endSection": "abstract"}]}, {"body": "What is the function of BRD4?", "documents": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28837371", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21652721", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933601", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25788266", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525743", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17626100", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174254", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284786", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483785"], "ideal_answer": ["As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators.

While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage.", "In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species. An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation. During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD.
