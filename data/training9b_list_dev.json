                "Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of drug-related problems (DRPs), identify the most common drugs, and drug classes involved in DRPs as well as associated factors with the occurrence of DRPs.A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 225 patients admitted to medical wards of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa from March to June 2014. Analysis of the data showed that albumin possesses a single strong binding site for warfarin with an association constant of 154,000 at 3 degrees C and secondary classes of several sites with a much lower affinity. Four medications or medication classes were implicated alone or in combination in 67.0% (95% CI, 60.0 to 74.1) of hospitalizations: warfarin (33.3%), insulins (13.9%), oral antiplatelet agents (13.3%), and oral hypoglycemic agents (10.7%). Drugs such as gentamycin, warfarin, nifedipine, and cimetidine have the highest probability of causing DRP. Drugs with the highest drug risk ratio were gentamycin, warfarin, nifedipine, and cimetidine. The drugs most frequently causing a DRP were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, warfarin, spironolactone, and \u03b2-blockers."

One approach to this question is examining allelic variation in the X-linked monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, previously associated with impulsive aggression in animals and humans.

The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT and Cistrome web-servers for downstream analysis, and can also be visualized in the UCSC genome browser where custom tracks can be added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in variety of formats.

To facilitate data extraction, SEA supports multiple search options, including species, genome location, gene name, cell type/tissue and super-enhancer name. The response provides detailed (epi)genetic information, incorporating cell type specificity, nearby genes, transcriptional factor binding sites, CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, evolutionary conservation, SNPs, H3K27ac, DNA methylation, gene expression and TF ChIP-seq data.

The calculated dynamics parameters of the electrode process indicate that there are obvious interactions between the probe and the ctDNA in aqueous solution. Under constant potential conditions, the redox current peak of the probe (Ni-complex) decreases obviously as the probe interacts/binds with ctDNAs. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA."

We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.",

We show that STEF depletion reduces apical perinuclear actin cables (a phenotype rescued by targeting active Rac1 to the nuclear envelope), increases nuclear height and impairs nuclear re-orientation. STEF down-regulation also reduces perinuclear pMLC and decreases myosin-generated tension at the nuclear envelope, suggesting that STEF-mediated Rac1 activity regulates NMMIIB activity to promote stabilisation of the perinuclear actin cap. Finally, STEF depletion decreases nuclear stiffness and reduces expression of TAZ-regulated genes, indicating an alteration in mechanosensing pathways as a consequence of disruption of the actin cap.",
