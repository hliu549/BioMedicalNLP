Here we show that high expression of uc.339 correlates with lower survival in 210 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We provide evidence from cell lines and primary samples that TP53 directly regulates uc.339. We find that transcribed uc.339 is upregulated in archival NSCLC samples, functioning as a decoy RNA for miR-339-3p, -663b-3p, and -95-5p. As a result, Cyclin E2, a direct target of all these microRNAs is upregulated, promoting cancer growth and migration. Finally, we find that modulation of uc.339 affects microRNA expression. However, overexpression or downregulation of these microRNAs causes no significant variations in uc.339 levels, suggesting a type of interaction for uc.339 that we call \"entrapping\".

{"id": "601d6ec61cb411341a000032_2", "question": "Which conditions are manifested by TRIM8 mutations?", "context": "Mutations in the TRIM8 gene have been described in patients with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Only six patients have been described to date. All the previous mutations were truncating variants clustered in the C-terminus of the protein. A previous patient with TRIM8-related epileptic encephalopathy was reported to have nephrotic syndrome. Here we describe the clinical, radiological and histological features of an 8-year-old male patient with a TRIM8 mutation who, in contrast to previous patients, had only mild intellectual disability and well-controlled epilepsy. The patient was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age. Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His kidney function declined and peritoneal dialysis was started at 5 years of age. He underwent renal transplant at 7 years of age. Trio-based whole genome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912.2) c.1198_1220del, p.(Tyr400ArgfsTer2). This patient is further evidence that TRIM8 mutations cause a syndrome with both neurological and renal features. Our findings suggest the spectrum of TRIM8-related disease may be wider than previously thought with the possibility of milder neurodevelopmental problems and/or a more severe, progressive renal phenotype.

The growing variety of tools for measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number.RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints, the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented.CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of single- and multi-track copy number data using algorithms based on coherent least squares principles.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1054], "text": ["Copynumber"]}}

While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on HapMap samples, tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss.

{"id": "601ec0c91cb411341a00005f_26", "question": "Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?", "context": "Most approaches used to find recurrent or differential DNA Copy Number Alterations (CNA) in array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data from groups of tumour samples depend on the discretization of the aCGH data to gain, loss or no-change states. This causes loss of valuable biological information in tumour samples, which are frequently heterogeneous. We have previously developed an algorithm, KC-SMART, that bases its estimate of the magnitude of the CNA at a given genomic location on kernel convolution (Klijn et al., 2008). This accounts for the intensity of the probe signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple samples.RESULTS: Here we extend the approach to allow comparative analyses of two groups of samples and introduce the R implementation of these two approaches. The comparative module allows for a supervised analysis to be performed, to enable the identification of regions that are differentially aberrated between two user-defined classes.We analyzed data from a series of B- and T-cell lymphomas and were able to retrieve all positive control regions (VDJ regions) in addition to a number of new regions. A t-test employing segmented data, that we implemented, was also able to locate all the positive control regions and a number of new regions but these regions were highly fragmented.CONCLUSIONS: KC-SMARTR offers recurrent CNA and class specific CNA detection, at different genomic scales, in a single package without the need for additional segmentation. It is memory efficient and runs on a wide range of machines. Most importantly, it does not rely on data discretization and therefore maximally exploits the biological information in the aCGH data.The program is freely available from the Bioconductor website http://www.bioconductor.org/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1368], "text": ["KC-SMARTR"]}}

However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge. We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs.RESULTS: Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time. We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-OR Linear program Solver (CLP).", "answers": {"answer_start": [1009], "text": ["TreeEFM"]}}

Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs.RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver. We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.", "answers": {"answer_start": [357], "text": ["EFM-Ta"]}}
