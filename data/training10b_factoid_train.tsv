606081e594d57fd879000041	Which bioconductor tool has been developed for accessing bacterial regulatory networks?	Programmatic access to bacterial regulatory networks with regutools. RegulonDB has collected, harmonized and centralized data from hundreds of experiments for nearly two decades and is considered a point of reference for transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K12. Here, we present the regutools R package to facilitate programmatic access to RegulonDB data in computational biology. regutools gives researchers the possibility of writing reproducible workflows with automated queries to RegulonDB. The regutools package serves as a bridge between RegulonDB data and the Bioconductor ecosystem by reusing the data structures and statistical methods powered by other Bioconductor packages. We demonstrate the integration of regutools with Bioconductor by analyzing transcription factor DNA binding sites and transcriptional regulatory networks from RegulonDB. We anticipate that regutools will serve as a useful building block in our progress to further our understanding of gene regulatory networks.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: regutools is an R package available through Bioconductor at bioconductor.org/packages/regutools.

6057c78994d57fd879000034	Which protein is involved in the organization and regulation of pluripotency-associated three-dimensional enhancer networks?	KLF4 is involved in the organization and regulation of pluripotency-associated three-dimensional enhancer networks. Cell fate transitions are accompanied by global transcriptional, epigenetic and topological changes driven by transcription factors, as is exemplified by reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells through the expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and cMYC. How transcription factors orchestrate the complex molecular changes around their target gene loci remains incompletely understood. Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes.

5717d64f29809bbe7a000001	Which is the cellular localization of the protein Opa1?	. The subcellular distribution of mOPA1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells largely overlapped that of endogenous cytochrome c, a well known mitochondrial marker, elease of high MW Opa-1 isoforms from the mitochondria to the cytosol  mitochondrial fusion (opa-1) mitochondrial fusion genes Mfn1 (mitofusin 1), Mfn2 (mitofusin 2), Opa1 (optic atrophy 1)  Biochemical examinations indicate that both of the OPA1 isoforms are present in the intermembrane space. Submitochondrial fractionation by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation shows that the 88-kDa protein predominantly associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane, on the contrary, the 93-kDa protein associates with the inner membrane.  We describe here a nuclear gene, OPA1, that maps within the candidate region and encodes a dynamin-related protein localized to mitochondria.  The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria. Regulation of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Opa1 by proteolytic cleavage. Differential sublocalization of the dynamin-related protein OPA1 isoforms in mitochondria. The human dynamin-related protein OPA1 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the inter-membrane space. In addition to the capacity of these proteins to promote fusion, mitofusin 2 or OPA1 regulate mitochondrial metabolism and loss-of-function reduces oxygen consumption and the capacity to oxidize substrates. Here, we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations. Our experiments restrict the function of prohibitins to mitochondria and identify the processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1, an essential component of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, as the central cellular process controlled by prohibitins. LRRK2 partially co-localizes with endosomal dynamin-1 or with mitofusins and OPA1 at mitochondrial membranes. While initial fusion of mitochondria by 15d-PGJ2 required the presence of both outer (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and inner (OPA1) mitochondrial membrane fusion proteins, later mitochondrial changes involved increased degradation of the fusion protein OPA1 and ubiquitination of newly synthesized OPA1 along with decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2, which likely contributed to the loss of tubular rigidity, disorganization of cristae, and formation of large swollen degenerated dysfunctional mitochondria. Assay and properties of the mitochondrial dynamin related protein Opa1. Mitochondrial remodeling following fission inhibition by 15d-PGJ2 involves molecular changes in mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1. We have previously described that silencing of the mitochondrial protein OPA1 enhances mitochondrial Ca(2+) signaling and aldosterone production in H295R adrenocortical cells. Our results define, for the first time, a function of the middle domain of the Opa1 protein and demonstrate that mitochondrial retention of Opa1 protein is essential for normal embryogenesis. Here, we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations Differential sublocalization of the dynamin-related protein OPA1 isoforms in mitochondria The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria.  Mitochondrial fission and fusion mediators, hFis1 and OPA1, modulate cellular senescence. The dynamin-related GTPase protein OPA1, localized in the intermembrane space and tethered to the inner membrane of mitochondria, participates in the fusion of these organelles.  Lack of mitochondrial retention of Opa1 is sufficient to cause the cellular Opa1 loss-of-function phenotype as the mitochondria are fragmented, indicating an inability to fuse.  Opa1, also known as Mgm1 in yeast, is a mitochondrial member of the dynamin family. Unlike other dynamin family members, Opa1 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that this protein is imported into mitochondria. Here, we describe biochemical techniques, such as mitochondrial isolation, digitonin extraction, a protease protection assay, and carbonate extraction, that were used to determine that mammalian Opa1 resides in the intermembrane space where it is tightly bound to the inner membrane. The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, The dynamin-related GTPase protein OPA1, localized in the intermembrane space and tethered to the inner membrane of mitochondria, participates in the fusion of these organelles. we identified two isoforms of OPA1 proteins in HeLa cells and examined their submitochondrial localization and complex formations. PKA phosphorylates perilipin, a protein localized on the surface of lipid droplets that serves as a gatekeeper to regulate access of lipases converting stored triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here, we report a new function for optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), a protein known to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, as a dual-specificity A-kinase anchoring protein associated with lipid droplets. We find that Mgm1/OPA1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space,	['mitochondrial intermembrane space']

In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P < .001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (SLCTs) are uncommon neoplasms that are occasionally associated with an elevated level of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of germ cell neoplasms, particularly yolk sac tumor (YST).  Serum α-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used diagnostic biomarker, but it has limited sensitivity and is not elevated in all HCC cases so, we incorporate a second blood-based biomarker, des'γ carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), that has shown potential as a screening marker for HCC.  Cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and surveillance with ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended.  The combination of enhancement patterns on CEUS and serum tumor markers (AFP and CA19-9) may be a potentially specific diagnostic method to differentiate CHC from HCC and CC.

5e2902688b3851296d000005	Which receptor is inhibited by Teprotumumab?	A recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a human IGF1R inhibiting antibody, in patients with moderate to severe, active TAO, indicates the potential effectiveness and safety of the drug.  Results from a very recently published clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab, an inhibitory human anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody, in active, moderate to severe TAO are extremely encouraging. The induction in fibrocytes is a consequence of increased TNF-α gene promoter activity and is independent of ongoing protein synthesis. It could be attenuated by dexamethasone and the IGF-1 receptor inhibiting antibody, teprotumumab. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody targeting IGF-IR in TAO.

Suvorexant is the first DORA to be approved and has demonstrated efficacy at decreasing both time to sleep onset and increasing total sleep time compared with placebo.  Suvorexant: a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the treatment of sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia. CONCLUSION: Suvorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of insomnia.  Crystal structure of the human OX2 orexin receptor bound to the insomnia drug suvorexant.  The human OX2 receptor (OX2R) belongs to the β branch of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and can bind to diverse compounds including the native agonist peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and the potent therapeutic inhibitor suvorexant.  Orexin receptor antagonism for treatment of insomnia: a randomized clinical trial of suvorexant. Promotion of sleep by suvorexant-a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist. The neurotransmitter systems on which the development of these agents were based included serotonin for ondansetron and lorcaserin, dopamine for varenicline, substance P (or neurokinin) for aprepitant, melatonin for ramelteon, and orexin for suvorexant. The indications were chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting for ondansetron and aprepitant, smoking cessation for varenicline, weight loss for lorcaserin, and insomnia for suvorexant and ramelteon. Suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the management of insomnia. Suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the management of insomnia. The orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors are two G protein-coupled receptors that bind the neuropeptides orexin-A and orexin-B.

56c1f039ef6e394741000052	Which antibody is implicated in the Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis?	In addition, BBE and Fisher syndrome, which are clinically similar and are both associated with the presence of the immunoglobulin G anti-GQ1b antibody, represent a specific autoimmune disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms that include ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. The syndrome defined by Bickerstaff of progressive, external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, with disturbance of consciousness or hyperreflexia, has subsequently been associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies. An anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome has been proposed to underlie the common pathophysiology for the three disorders; however, other studies have found a positive anti-GM1 instead of anti-GQ1b antibody. Serologic analysis of antibodies against ganglioside complexes (anti-GDIa, anti-GDIb, anti-GM1, anti-GM2, anti-GM3, anti-GQIb and anti-GTIb antibodies) showed negative results. However, contrary to a proposed anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome, we would suggest that pathogenesis of this clinical spectrum is not limited to anti-ganglioside antibodies. Although there are usually no abnormalities in MFS by routine neuroimaging, in a few cases, contrast enhancement of nerve roots and signs of central nervous system involvement were described supporting the hypothesis of an anti-GQ1b-syndrome, a continuum involving GBS, MFS, and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis.  Anti-GM1 IgG, GD1a IgG, GQ1b IgG, and GT1a IgG antibodies were positive. The discovery of the association of the anti-GQ1b IgG antibody with the postinfectious clinical syndromes of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia helped house the phenotypes of the Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), atypical MFS, Guillain-Barré syndrome with ophthalmoplegia, and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis under one roof.  These findings suggest that host susceptibility may play a role in inducing the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies and the development of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. These antibodies should provide useful serological markers for identifying patients who have atypical GBS with preserved deep tendon reflexes, ataxic GBS, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis or acute ophthalmoparesis, especially for those who have no antibodies to GM1, GD1a or GQ1b. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Fisher syndrome: anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome. Among them, only one patient developed Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, who carried anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies. Overlapping Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis associated with anti-GQ1b IgG antibody after herpes simplex virus infection. Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, Miller Fisher syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome overlap in an asthma patient with negative anti-ganglioside antibodies. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis is a clinical syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and central nervous system signs and is associated with the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. This is only the second case in the literature of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis with raised titers of anti-GQ1b antibodies described in association with M pneumoniae infection. Of those patients with Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, ataxic GBS or acute ophthalmoparesis, 33% of 67 anti-GM1b-positive, and 52% of 25 anti-GalNAc-GD1a-positive patients had no anti-GQ1b antibodies. Fisher syndrome or Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis? Anti-GQ1b IgG antibody syndrome involving both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Anti-GQ1b antibody has been found in Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with ophthalmoplegia, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE), and acute ophthalmoplegia without ataxia (AO). This case presented clinical characteristics of three syndromes concurrently-Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome-that may be collectively called 'anti-GQ1b IgG antibody syndrome'. This is the case of a 79-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with Guillain-Barré syndrome with features overlapping with the Miller Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and positive antiganglioside GQ1b antibody about 6 months after treatment with bendamustine and rituximab.

54e0ba781388e8454a000011	Where is the metaxin complex localized?	 The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif. Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1.  TOM20 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), METAXIN, and mtOM64 (outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD).  The outer membrane protein METAXIN was characterized to play a role in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins and likely plays a role in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin exists as a complex with SAM50, metaxins 1 and 2, coiled-coil-helix coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 3 and 6 and DnaJC11.  The functional role of this new complex is uncertain. However, a role in protein import related to maintenance of mitochondrial structure is suggested as mitofilin helps regulate mitochondrial morphology and at least four of the associated proteins (metaxins 1 and 2, SAM50 and CHCHD3) have been implicated in protein import, while DnaJC11 is a chaperone-like protein that may have a similar role. We conclude that the pathway of VDAC biogenesis in human mitochondria involves the TOM complex, Sam50 and metaxins, and that it is evolutionarily conserved. Functional analysis of human metaxin in mitochondrial protein import in cultured cells and its relationship with the Tom complex. Metaxin is an outer membrane protein of mammalian mitochondria which is suggested to be involved in protein import into the organelle. Metaxin 1 interacts with metaxin 2, a novel related protein associated with the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane. In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria.  . Metaxin 2 in intact mitochondria was susceptible to digestion with proteinase K, indicating that metaxin 2 is located on the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. metaxin gene (Mtx), which encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane import protein. Metaxin is a component of a preprotein import complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion.	['To the outer mitochondrial membrane.']
5a885add61bb38fb24000017	What is the H4S47C cleavage mapping method used for?	To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase.  To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome.  To map fission yeast centromeres, we applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping and native and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation with paired-end sequencing. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)2 tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. H3 nucleosomes are nearly absent from the central domain, which is occupied by centromere-specific H3 (cenH3 or CENP-A) nucleosomes with two H4s per particle that are mostly unpositioned and are more widely spaced than nucleosomes elsewhere. To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation.  phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load. The ablation of a muscle-specific sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor, phospholamban, rescued the spectrum of phenotypes that resemble human heart failure. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function.

56ffdc1ccf1c32585100000b	Which is the most common editing modification in eukaryotic mRNA?	One of the most common forms of pre-mRNA editing is A-to-I editing, in which adenosine is deaminated to inosine, which is read as guanosine during translation. Deamination of adenine by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) leads to the conversion of adenine into inosine (A-I editing) recognized by the splicing and translation systems as guanine. denosine deaminases editing adenines in transport RNAs (ADATs) convert adenine into inosine in tRNAs of all eukaryotes; as a result, the diversity of tRNA forms in the cell increases. A-to-I editing events in normal and cancerous human keratinocytes A-to-I RNA editing can alter codons, substitute amino acids and affect protein sequence, structure, and function. -to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism frequently used to expand and diversify transcriptome and proteome repertoire in eukaryotic cells This study describes for the first time A-to-I editing in the coding sequence of a tumor suppressor gene in humans, and suggests that IGFBP7 editing serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to maintain the equilibrium between proliferation and senescence in normal skin. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in higher eukaryotes.  RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). The most common RNA editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I). It occurs in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms and in some viruses. One of the most common forms of pre-mRNA editing is A-to-I editing, in which adenosine is deaminated to inosine, which is read as guanosine during translation.

533ba218fd9a95ea0d000007	What is the clinical indication of cardiac T1 mapping magnetic resonance?	More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods.  Recent T1 mapping techniques aim to overcome the limitations of late gadolinium enhancement to assess diffuse fibrosis. T1 mapping techniques performed both with and without contrast are enabling quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and myocardial infiltration. Noncontrast T1 mapping has high diagnostic accuracy for detecting cardiac AL amyloidosis, correlates well with markers of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and is potentially more sensitive for detecting early disease than LGE imaging. T1 mapping has been proposed as potentially valuable in the quantitative assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, but no studies to date have systematically evaluated its role in the differentiation of healthy myocardium from diffuse disease in a clinical setting.  This study demonstrates that native and post-contrast T1 values provide indexes with high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of normal and diffusely diseased myocardium. T1 values lengthened with greater LVMI and correlated with the degree of biopsy-quantified fibrosis. This may provide a useful clinical assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in the future. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping has been used to characterize myocardial diffuse fibrosis.  In HCM and DCM, noncontrast T1 mapping detects underlying disease processes beyond those assessed by LGE in relatively low-risk individuals.

An 8-year-old girl received 53 grays radiotherapy after surgery for craniopharyngioma. One year later she developed generalized dystonia Pharmacological treatment with tetrabenazine, clonazepam and trihexiphenydile allowed a very limited improvement of dystonia; welve cases of status dystonicus, of various underlying aetiologies, are presented Drug therapy with benzhexol, tetrabenazine and pimozide or haloperidol may be beneficial in some cases. Over the past 15 years we have treated 526 patients with severe hyperkinetic movement disorders with tetrabenazine (TBZ) The global response rating of 1 (marked improvement) was recorded in 89.2% of 93 patients with tardive stereotypy, 83.3% of 12 with myoclonus, 82.8% of 29 with Huntington's disease, 80.5% of 82 with tardive dystonia, 79.3% of 29 with other movement disorders, 62.9% of 108 with idiopathic dystonia Twelve adults with severe axial dystonia, and two children with life-threatening generalised dystonia were treated with a combination of a low constant dose of tetrabenazine to which were added pimozide and benzhexol as necessary. When benzhexol treatment alone fails in adults with severe disabling axial dystonia, or in children with life-threatening generalised dystonia, combined therapy with tetrabenazine, pimozide and benzhexol may give valuable symptomatic relief. We present 42 patients with tardive dystonia. The age of onset of dystonia was 13 to 60 years.

55450521bf90a13052000001	What is the effect of enamel matrix derivative on pulp regeneration?	Among the human studies, two studies reported that EMD is a more efficient DPC procedure compared with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 ). One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC procedures EMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCs  the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulated EMD could enhance the mineralization of hDPSCs upregulated the expression of markers for odontoblast/osteoblast-like cells. Further studies are required to determine if EMD can improve pulp tissue repair and regeneration In both the scaffold groups, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin messenger RNA was up-regulated significantly in EMD-treated hDPCs when compared with the nontreated cells Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposure In the EMD-treated teeth, large amounts of newly formed dentin-like hard tissue with associated formative cells outlined the pulpal wound separating the cavity area from the remaining pulp tissue Inflammatory cells were present in the wound area but not subjacent to the newly formed hard tissue. Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p < 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide	['increase of the osteogenic potential of hDPCs']

58edf567eda5a57672000011	How many genes constitute the DosR regulon, controlled by the dormancy survival regulator (DosR) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis?	During this phase, at least 48 genes, collectively named Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, are important for the long-term survival of bacilli under a non-respiring state, a condition that bacilli encounter inside granulomatous lesions. The dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon, composed of 48 co-regulated genes, is held as essential for Mtb persistence.  DosR/DevR of M. tuberculosis is a two component dormancy survival response regulator which induces the expression of 48 genes.  The functional importance of tandem arrangement was established by analyzing promoter variants harboring Dev boxes with altered spacing. Conserved sequence logos were generated from 47 binding sequences which included 24 newly discovered Dev boxes.  The two component sensor/regulator dosRS is a major mediator in the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and controls a regulon of approximately 50 genes that are induced under this condition. In silico analysis of the DosR regulon in BCG and M. tuberculosis showed at least 97% amino acid sequence homology, with 41 out of 48 genes being identical.

5c307474133db5eb78000033	Which complex is bound by estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb)?	Knockdown of Mp1 redirected FGF4 signaling from differentiation toward pluripotency and up-regulated the pluripotency-related genes Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, and Sox2. Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. Co-motif discovery identifies an Esrrb-Sox2-DNA ternary complex as a mediator of transcriptional differences between mouse embryonic and epiblast stem cells Through the use of knockdown experiments, we argue that the Esrrb-Sox2 complex is an arbiter of gene expression differences between ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC).  Nanog expression in epiblast is directly regulated by Nodal/Smad2 pathway in a visceral endoderm-dependent manner. Notably, Nanog promoters switch from Oct4/Esrrb in ICM/ESCs to Oct4/Smad2 in epiblasts. 	['The Esrrb-Sox2 complex']

X-linked Christianson syndrome: heterozygous female Slc9a6 knockout mice develop mosaic neuropathological changes and related behavioral abnormalities. CS is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which encodes a multipass transmembrane sodium (potassium)-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) protein, functional in early recycling endosomes.  A Christianson syndrome-linked deletion mutation (∆(287)ES(288)) in SLC9A6 disrupts recycling endosomal function and elicits neurodegeneration and cell death. BACKGROUND: Christianson Syndrome, a recently identified X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the human gene SLC9A6 encoding the recycling endosomal alkali cation/proton exchanger NHE6.  BACKGROUND: Mutations of SLC9A6 may cause an X-linked clinical syndrome first described by Christianson in 1999 in which affected males exhibited profound intellectual disability, autism, drug-resistant epilepsy, ophthalmoplegia, mild craniofacial dysmorphism, microcephaly, and ataxia. OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6).  Genetic and phenotypic diversity of NHE6 mutations in Christianson syndrome. Mutations in the solute carrier family 9, subfamily A member 6 (SLC9A6) gene, encoding the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) are associated with Christianson syndrome, a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, autistic behavior, early onset seizures and ataxia. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6.

53357ca0d6d3ac6a3400004b	Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug fostamatinib?	It outlines preclinical and early clinical experiences with the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) and discusses various options for further clinical development of this compound.  To assess the efficacy and safety of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that did not respond to biologic therapies.  The mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated antitumor activity in all types of lymphoma, the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the PKC-β inhibitor enzastaurin is being used as consolidation therapy after remission in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Fostamatinib, a Syk-kinase inhibitor, does not affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R788, an oral inhibitor of Syk, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. The Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) inhibits tumor growth in the Eμ- TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL by blocking antigen-dependent B-cell receptor signaling. We have now investigated whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of the leukemias that develop in the Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. We show that conditional ablation of the syk gene in dendritic cells (DCs) abrogates FcgammaR-mediated cross priming of diabetogenic T cells in RIP-mOVA mice, a situation phenocopied in wild-type RIP-mOVA mice treated with the selective Syk inhibitor R788. We investigated the ability of a small drug Syk inhibitor, R788, to protect mice against mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced local (intestine) and remote lung injury. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R406 is orally administered as the prodrug R788.  Inhibition of Syk with fostamatinib disodium has significant clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These data prompted a phase 1/2 clinical trial of fostamatinib disodium, the first clinically available oral Syk inhibitor, in patients with recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).  We examined the effect of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an oral prodrug of the selective Syk inhibitor R406, in nephrotoxic nephritis in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor prodrug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing fostamatinib, a prodrug of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R-406, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and B-cell lymphomas. In developmental toxicity studies with the Syk kinase inhibitor R788, a spectrum of findings, including renal agenesis, were observed. R788, a prodrug of active metabolite R406, has been shown to be an inhibitor of Syk kinase, active in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting potential activity in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  In collagen-induced arthritis, R788/R406, a novel and potent small molecule Syk inhibitor suppressed clinical arthritis, bone erosions, pannus formation, and synovitis.  Fostamatinib (R788) inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and has been in clinical trials involving both MTX inadequate responders (MTX-IRs) and biologic inadequate responders.  The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor.  TK inhibitors including spleen TK (fostamatinib) and Janus kinases (tofacitinib) inhibitors are two novel oral therapies that have demonstrated short-term good clinical responses in active rheumatoid arthritis patients with and inadequate responses to methotrexate or other traditional (non-biologic) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  Progress is also being made with orally active Syk inhibitors. One such inhibitor (fostamatinib) is currently in large-scale phase 3 trials, and there are others in clinical development. We have shown that R406, the active metabolite of the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest while decreasing downstream phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphoma PTLD lines in vitro. Effects of fostamatinib (R788), an oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on health-related quality of life in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: analyses of patient-reported outcomes from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib, a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, in healthy human subjects following single and multiple oral dosing in three phase I studies. Fostamatinib (R788) is an orally dosed prodrug designed to deliver the active metabolite R940406 (R406), a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Fostamatinib demonstrates rapid and extensive conversion to R406, an inhibitor of SYK. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor that successfully completed phase II clinical trials, also exhibits some undesirable side effects. Fostamatinib (R788) is a prodrug rapidly converted to its active metabolite on oral administration. This (known as R406) is a potent inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase, required for the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines.  The Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, proved superior to placebo in Phase II trials and is currently under Phase III investigation. T More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263).  Because inhibitors of SYK activity, such as fostamatinib, are in advanced clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, understanding the role of SYK in signalling via TLR4 is of immediate importance.  The search terms used were Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors, PCI-32765, GDC-0834, LFM-A13, AVL-101, AVL-292, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors, R343, R406, R112, R788, fostamatinib, BAY-61-3606, C-61, piceatannol, Lyn, imatinib, nilotinib, bafetinib, dasatinib, GDC-0834, PP2, SU6656 in conjunction with lymphoid malignancy, NHL, CLL, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of Syk activity by R788 in platelets prevents remote lung tissue damage after mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently, Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against autoimmune and allergic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), bronchial asthma and thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Syk becomes activated by external signals from the tissue microenvironment, and was targeted in a first clinical trial with R788 (fostamatinib), a relatively nonspecific Syk inhibitor. In vivo expansion of luciferase(+) donor Tcs in mice developing GvHD was reduced by treatment with the Syk inhibitor Fostamatinib, which led to increased survival and reduced histologically confirmed GvHD severity. Syk inhibition with fostamatinib leads to transitional B lymphocyte depletion. No oral biologic agents are available at this time but promising data is emerging for two drugs, tofacitinib and fostamatinib, inhibitors of JAK and Syk kinases, respectively.  Fostamatinib (R-788) is an orally bioavailable small molecule. It is the prodrug of R406, which is a potent Syk inhibitor.  The oral spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib attenuates inflammation and atherogenesis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice consuming a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 2 doses of the orally available SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for 16 weeks showed a dose-dependent reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size by up to 59±6% compared with the respective controls.

553c9f96f32186855800000c	How are ultraconserved elements called when they form clusters?	We were wondering whether this approach could provide insights about utlraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). These elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes. Their molecular functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation remain enigmatic This 'winner-takes-all' pattern suggests that UCNEs of a GRB function in a highly cooperative manner. We propose that the multitude of interactions between UCNEs is the reason for their extreme sequence conservation UCNEbase--a database of ultraconserved non-coding elements and genomic regulatory blocks The majority of UCNEs are supposed to be transcriptional regulators of key developmental genes. As most of them occur as clusters near potential target genes, the database is organized along two hierarchical levels: individual UCNEs and ultra-conserved genomic regulatory blocks (UGRBs) These elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes.

54e0ace81388e8454a000010	Is APOBEC3B protein predominantly cytoplasmic or nuclear?	A3B is the only family member with steady-state nuclear localization Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase) Our studies suggest that the present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral AID protein during the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in primates However, we found that the predominantly nuclear A3B only weakly restricted infection by HIV-1, HIV-1Δvif, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), while significantly inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition In contrast to the exclusively cytoplasmic A3G, which is inactive against LINE-1 retrotransposition, the A3G/B protein, while localized mainly to the cytoplasm, was also present in the nucleus. Further mutational analysis revealed that residues 18, 19, 22, and 24 in A3B were the major determinants for nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization and antiretroviral activity these observations suggest that changing 4 residues in the amino terminus of A3B not only retargets the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but also enhances its ability to restrict HIV while retaining inhibition of retrotransposition After mitosis, APOBEC3B becomes nuclear, and APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G become cytoplasmic To define the domains of APOBEC3G that determine cytoplasmic localization, comparisons were made with APOBEC3B, which is predominantly nuclear. The mechanism of L1 inhibition did not correlate with an obvious subcellular protein distribution as APOBEC3B appeared predominantly nuclear and APOBEC3F was mostly cytosolic.

5e4bf9436d0a27794100002d	Which transcription factor controls Drosophila's Hes genes?	Transcriptional dynamics elicited by a short pulse of notch activation involves feed-forward regulation by E(spl)/Hes genes. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Hes genes are responsible for co-ordinating the Notch response of a wide spectrum of other targets, explaining the critical functions these key regulators play in many developmental and disease contexts. Mammalian Hes genes encode transcriptional factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Notch-Hes1 pathway regulates ovarian somatic cell development, which is necessary for oocyte survival and maturation. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell interaction In this study, we identified the Atrophin family protein RERE (also called Atro2) as a positive regulator of Notch target Hes genes in the developing vertebrate spinal cord HES transcriptional repressors are important components of the Notch pathway that regulates neurogenesis from Drosophila to vertebrates. Notch signaling produces an initial burst of hes5 activity, which represses hes6-2  Transient transfection analyses demonstrated that, while Hes1 and Hes5 promoter activities are significantly upregulated by the active form of Notch, a key regulator of cellular differentiation, Hes2 and Hes3 promoter activities are not. These results suggest that Hes genes are functionally classified into two groups: those that are regulated by Notch and those that are not. hairy and Enhancer of split function in both segmentation and in the Notch neurogenic pathway during Drosophila embryo development. Previous expression data suggested a conserved role for the Hes genes in the Notch signalling pathway, but not in segmentation. These data suggest that Notch signaling through activation of HES transcriptional repressors may play a role in murine placental development. In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which interact with the Groucho protein to shut off achaete-scute transcription.  data from these hyperplasias with chromatin occupancy data for Dpn, a Hes transcription factor, to identify genes regulated by Hes factors in this process. We show that the Notch/He Prdm proto-oncogene transcription factor family expression and interaction with the Notch-Hes pathway in mouse neurogenesis. In Drosophila we recently characterized Hamlet, a transcription factor that mediates Notch signalling and neural cell fate. HESR1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors regulated by the Notch signaling pathway in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos, and is related to the HES/Hairy/E (sp1) family. H Hairy-related transcription factor (HRT/Hey) genes encode a novel subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors related to the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split (E(spl)) and the mammalian HES proteins that function as downstream mediators of Notch signaling. Usin t has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that Delta-dependent Notch signaling activates the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, leading to an increased expression of the Enhancer of Split genes.  Here we analyze genome-wide changes in transcript levels, binding of the Notch pathway transcription factor, CSL [Suppressor of Hairless, Su(H), in Drosophila], and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) immediately following a short pulse of Notch stimulation. Other genes had a more delayed response, the timing of which was largely unaffected by more prolonged Notch activation. Hes and Hey genes are the mammalian counterparts of the Hairy and Enhancer-of-split type of genes in Drosophila and they represent the primary targets of the Delta-Notch signaling pathway. We show that the Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes. Furthermore, we observed that Dl-1-induced HES-1 transactivation was dependent both on Kuzbanian and RBP-J activities, consistent with the involvement of these two proteins in Notch signaling in Drosophila.

54e0d7471388e8454a000015	Which molecule is targeted by a monoclonal antibody Secukinumab?	We identified 3 distinct clonotypes that efficiently neutralized IL17A in a cell-based in vitro assay. Their potencies were comparable to those of known neutralizing antibodies, including 2, AIN457 (secukinumab) and ixekizumab that are currently in clinical development for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders.  Secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. BACKGROUND: Secukinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody. BACKGROUND: Secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis when administered via subcutaneous injection.  We evaluated secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  Ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody directed against the common p40 subunit of IL-23 and IL-12), secukinumab, ixekizumab (both monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-17A), and brodalumab a monoclonal antibody against the IL-17RA receptor) have been recently used in proof-of-concept and randomized trials in the ankylosing spondylitis and/or psoriatic arthritis subforms of SpA, with overall very promising clinical efficacy. The selective anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) attenuates IL17A-induced levels of IL6 in human astrocytes. The family of interleukin 17 receptors (IL17Rs), subtypes IL17RA-IL17RE, is targeted by the group of pro-inflammatory IL17 cytokines (IL17A-F) and moreover the newly developed anti-IL17A antibody secukinumab (AIN457) has shown promise in Phase II trials in multiple sclerosis.   Three agents neutralizing IL-17 (i.e., secukinumab and ixekizumab) or antagonizing its receptor (i.e., brodalumab) are currently being tested for efficacy and safety in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA. Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A whose efficacy in the therapy of chronic plaque psoriasis has been demonstrated in different phase II clinical trial.  Associations between IGA 0/1 responder rates and PASI scores were evaluated using data from two phase 2 studies with the anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) that utilized a similar 6-point IGA.  Several IL-17A inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-17RA monoclonal antibody brodalumab. Anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.  In a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A, was ineffective and associated with more adverse events than placebo. Several IL-17A blockers, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-IL-17 receptor subunit A monoclonal antibody brodalumab have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials.  Further studies are needed to clarify whether the therapeutic blockade of IL-17A through the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab is able to counteract the fibrogenic process in CD. Th-17A antagonism has been investigated by a randomized controlled trial in PsA patients with secukinumab, a fully human, high-affinity, monoclonal antibody in a cohort of patients with active PsA.  Efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriatic arthritis: a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II proof-of-concept trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human, anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody for targeted interleukin-17A blockade, in patients with noninfectious uveitis. Effect of IL-17A blockade with secukinumab in autoimmune diseases. Early clinical data are now available on secukinumab (AIN457), a recombinant, highly selective, fully human monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody of the IgG1/κ isotype, enabling a preliminary assessment of the effects of IL-17A inhibition in multiple autoimmune diseases. In conjunction with studies using the humanised anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) ixekizumab (LY2439821) and the fully human anti-IL-17RA mAb brodalumab (AMG 827), the findings on secukinumab provide evidence for the role of IL-17A in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease and suggest the potential value of targeting this cytokine. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A IgG1κ monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  Treatment with the interleukin-17A-blocking antibody secukinumab does not interfere with the efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects: results of an open-label, parallel-group, randomized single-center study. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects exposed to the anti-interleukin-17A (IL-17A) monoclonal antibody (MAb) secukinumab. Blockade of IL-17A by secukinumab does not appear to interfere with efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations, as assessed by the achievement of protective antibody levels.

Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP)  sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most important direct seizure-related cause of death, and most cases usually occur in patients with intractable, longstanding epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP): what do patients think? OBJECTIVES: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of mortality in epilepsy. In 11 patients cause of death was sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Epilepsy-related death, particularly sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), is still underestimated by healthcare professionals and this may reflect the mistaken belief that epilepsy is a benign condition Risk factors in sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP): the quest for mechanisms Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a - probably heterogeneous - condition where patients with epilepsy die suddenly, almost certainly during a seizure and with no other identified cause of death. Epilepsy, the commonest serious neurological condition, is associated with an increased risk in premature deaths, including an estimated 500 sudden unexpected deaths (SUDEP) per year in the UK. Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most important direct epilepsy-related cause of death. Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most important direct epilepsy-related cause of death. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an exceptionally difficult condition to study in humans. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP): don't ask, don't tell? Many individuals with epilepsy, as well as their partners, relatives, and friends, are unaware of the risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The baboon represents a natural model for genetic generalized epilepsy and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) refers to the sudden death of a seemingly healthy individual with epilepsy, usually occurring during, or immediately after, a tonic-clonic seizure. This condition is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and it accounts for a large proportion of deaths among people with epilepsy.

56caea805795f9a73e00002c	Which protein interacts with the Ragulator-RAG GTPases to control mTOR activity?	Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR. Here, we identify the human 11-pass transmembrane protein SLC38A9 as a novel component of the Rag-Ragulator complex SLC38A9 localizes with Rag-Ragulator complex components on lysosomes and associates with Rag GTPases in an amino acid-sensitive and nucleotide binding state-dependent manner Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery.  Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid-sensitive fashion.  Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid-sensitive fashion.

5e2e136bfbd6abf43b000023	Which portal has been developed to explore protein-protein interactions in cancer cell lines?	The OncoPPi Portal: an integrative resource to explore and prioritize protein-protein interactions for cancer target discovery. As cancer genomics initiatives move toward comprehensive identification of genetic alterations in cancer, attention is now turning to understanding how interactions among these genes lead to the acquisition of tumor hallmarks. Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.Results: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.Availability and implementation: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.Contact: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu.

SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and growth dysfunctions. The present report describes, for the first time, a Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia child with SMARCAL1 missense mutation (R561H) and manifestations of intussusception secondary to Epstein-Barr virus-negative non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who expired due to septicemia following chemotherapy. Mutations in SWI/SNF2 related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1 (SMARCAL1) gene are responsible for the disease. Sequence analysis revealed that patient was compound heterozygous for two SMARCAL1 mutations: a novel missense change (p.Arg247Pro) and a well-known nonsense mutation (p. Mutations in SMARCAL1, which encodes a DNA annealing helicase with roles in DNA replication fork restart, DNA repair, and gene expression modulation, cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by skeletal dysplasia, renal disease, T-cell immunodeficiency, and arteriosclerosis. Biallelic mutations of the DNA annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1) cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD, MIM 242900), an incompletely penetrant autosomal recessive disorder. A novel SMARCAL1 mutation associated with a mild phenotype of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD). SIOD is caused by mutations in the gene SMARCAL1. Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (OMIM 242900) is an uncommon autosomal-recessive multisystem disease caused by mutations in SMARCAL1 (swi/snf-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1), a gene encoding a putative chromatin remodeling protein. Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by defects in SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1 gene (SMARCAL1). Autosomal-recessive Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), T-cell immunodeficiency and facial dysmorphism is caused by defects in the SMARCAL1 gene. OBJECTIVE Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by SMARCAL1 (MIM:20606622) mutations, while in about half of the patients no any mutation in SMARCAL1 could be found.

by comprehensive anthropometric examination 28 parameters of 8 patients 3 females with the typical findings of schimke immuno osseous dysplasia mean age 14 8 years range 4 9 30 5 years and 304 patients 117 females with congenital and hereditary chronic kidney disease mean age 10 7 4 8 years range 3 21 8 years we show that schimke immuno osseous dysplasia patients differ significantly from those with other forms of chronic kidney disease z scores were calculated with reference limits derived from 5155 healthy children 2591 females aged 3 to 18 years the key finding was that in the latter group median leg length was significantly more reduced than sitting height whereas in schimke immuno osseous dysplasia patients the reduction of sitting height was significantly more pronounced than for leg length therefore the ratio of sitting height leg length might be a simple tool for the clinician to distinguish schimke immuno osseous dysplasia from other chronic kidney disease patients schimke immuno osseous dysplasia is very likely if this ratio is 0 83 however other forms of chronic kidney disease have to be discussed in case of a ratio 1 01. schimke immuno osseous dysplasia is an

587f795d92a5b8ad44000007	What is formin associated with in the snail?	Formin Is Associated with Left-Right Asymmetry in the Pond Snail and the Frog  Here, we report that a disabling mutation in one copy of a tandemly duplicated, diaphanous-related formin is perfectly associated with symmetry breaking in the pond snail. This is supported by the observation that an anti-formin drug treatment converts dextral snail embryos to a sinistral phenocopy, and in frogs, drug inhibition or overexpression by microinjection of formin has a chirality-randomizing effect in early (pre-cilia) embryos. Contrary to expectations based on existing models [3, 4 and 5], we discovered asymmetric gene expression in 2- and 4-cell snail embryos, preceding morphological asymmetry. As the formin-actin filament has been shown to be part of an asymmetry-breaking switch in vitro [6 and 7], together these results are consistent with the view that animals with diverse body plans may derive their asymmetries from the same intracellular chiral elements [8]. Here, we report that a disabling mutation in one copy of a tandemly duplicated, diaphanous-related formin is perfectly associated with symmetry breaking in the pond snail. This is supported by the observation that an anti-formin drug treatment converts dextral snail embryos to a sinistral phenocopy, and in frogs, drug inhibition or overexpression by microinjection of formin has a chirality-randomizing effect in early (pre-cilia) embryos.

5aae6499fcf456587200000c	What is BORSA?	Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) may be misidentified as intrinsically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the clinical laboratory. Borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) isolates, shown to grow on plates containing 2 to 3 μg/mL of oxacillin, were found within S. aureus isolates from chicken (3 isolates) and from meat (19 isolates). Since it is unknown whether β-lactam antimicrobial agents can be used effectively against borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) with oxacillin MICs ≥4 mg/L, the in vitro bactericidal activity and pharmacodynamic effect of oxacillin against clinical BORSA isolates was evaluated. Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) represents a quite poorly understood and inadequately defined phenotype of methicillin resistance. Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) exhibit oxacillin MIC values of 1-8 microg ml(-1), but lack mecA, which encodes the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a. Among them, 12 isolates were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 18 were borderline-oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and 40 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). hospital associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous type of methicillin resistance, and border-line resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA). borderline oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA)  borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) s borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA; mecA-negative, oxacillin MICs of 2 to 8 microgram/ml). borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA	['Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus']
5e3a6e70b5b409ea53000018	What is the target of a drug pidilizumab?	We present results from the first study to evaluate the immune modulating antibody MDV9300 (pidilizumab) in pediatric patients with DIPG.  This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C.  Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers. Recent successes in early Phase I/II trials using anti-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab or pidilizumab directed against PD-1 in the setting of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas validate the therapeutic utility of reversing B cell-mediated immune suppression.  RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have evaluated the prevalence and prognostic implications of PD-1, PD-L1/2 expression in various lymphoma subtypes. We present an overview of the clinical trials evaluating pidilizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab in patients with lymphoid malignancies, and highlight some of the more promising agents in this class, currently in development. BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the risk of elevated transaminases associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors use in patients with cancer.METHODS: Studies eligible for our analysis included randomized Phase II and III trials of patients with cancer on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab and pidilizumab, which describe events of elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]. AIM: We performed a meta-analysis of the risk of selected gastrointestinal toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.PATIENTS & METHODS: Eligible studies included randomized trials of patients with solid tumors on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab, pidilizumab and atezolizumab, describing events of diarrhea, vomiting or colitis. There are other perspective immune modulating agents, such as anti-PD 1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, pidilizumab) and anti-PD L1 antibodies.  High levels of peripheral blood Tregs prior to therapy were associated with decreased progression-free survival in FL patients treated with either chemotherapy or combination immunotherapy that targeted CD20 and PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies rituximab and pidilizumab, respectively.  Monoclonal antibodies to PD-1 (eg, nivolumab, lambrolizumab, and pidilizumab) and PD-L1 (MPDL3280A and BMS-936559) are in various stages of clinical development.  We did this phase 2 trial to investigate the activity of pidilizumab, a humanised anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, with rituximab in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. Pidilizumab is an mAb that binds to PD-1 and is a safe and well-tolerated therapy.

5149f494d24251bc0500004c	Which medication should be administered when managing patients with suspected acute opioid overdose?	Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist).  Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression Naloxone hydrochloride, an injectable opioid antagonist which reverses the respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension associated with opioids, has long been used to treat opioid overdose.  Experts have suggested that, as part of a comprehensive overdose prevention strategy, naloxone should be provided to heroin users for peer administration after an overdose.  Patients who received naloxone for known or presumed opioid overdose were formally evaluated one hour later for multiple potential predictor variables.  Patients with presumed opioid overdose can be safely discharged one hour after naloxone administration To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min.  There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose.  To illustrate this problem, we report the case of a patient inappropriately treated with naloxone and the results of a retrospective review of the medical records of 15 consecutive patients with cancer treated with naloxone in the emergency department over a 5-month period.  Management of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid antagonists.   The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. Opioid overdose is rarely the primary cause of altered mental status in cancer patients receiving opioid therapy. The inappropriate administration of naloxone to reverse an abnormal mental status can cause severe withdrawal symptoms and pain. 	['naloxone']

We developed JAMM (Joint Analysis of NGS replicates via Mixture Model clustering): a peak finder that can integrate information from biological replicates, determine enrichment site widths accurately and resolve neighboring narrow peaks. JAMM is a universal peak finder that is applicable to different types of datasets. We show that JAMM is among the best performing peak finders in terms of site detection accuracy and in terms of accurate determination of enrichment sites widths.

It is transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait. The disorder is a consequence of mutations in the NEMO gene (Xq28) that completely abolish expression of the NF-kappaB essential modulator Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder characterized by a distinctive swirling pattern of the skin; defects of teeth, hair, and nails; and ophthalmic, central nervous system, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. It progresses through several well-defined stages. IP is transmitted as a dominant X-linked trait with variable expressivity, but many--if not most--cases are sporadic. IP has been shown to result from mutations in the NEMO gene that completely abolish expression of NF-kappaB essential modulator Incontinentia pigmenti (IP; MIM308310) is a rare neurocutaneous X-dominant inherited disorder. Besides skin and neurological abnormalities, there is also ophthalmologic and dental involvement The disorder is observed almost exclusively in girls, but diseased boys are more seriously affected. The IP gene is localised on chromosome Xq28. Mutations in the NEMO-gene are responsible for IP. This gene codes for the nuclear factor-KB essential modulator protein (NEMO; synonym: inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK)y) Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked-dominant Mendelian disorder caused by mutation in the IKBKG/NEMO gene, encoding for NEMO/IKKgamma, a regulatory protein of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) signaling. Mutations in the NEMO gene give rise to a heterogeneous group of disorders, including the X-linked dominant disorder incontinentia pigmenti. In patients with incontinenia pigmenti, mutations in the NEMO gene are found. Mutations in the NEMO gene have been reported in association with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (HED-ID), OL-HED-ID, and incontinentia pigmenti.

Disruption of ALX1 causes extreme microphthalmia and severe facial clefting: expanding the spectrum of autosomal-recessive ALX-related frontonasal dysplasia. In the second family we identified a homozygous donor-splice-site mutation (c.531+1G>A) in the ALX1 gene, providing evidence that complete loss of function of ALX1 protein causes severe disruption of early craniofacial development.  expression of Alx1, an effector of scapula blade patterning, is absent in all compound mutants. Mutations in each of the transcriptional co-activator genes - CBP, p300, Cited2, Cart1 and Carm1 - result in neural tube defects in mice. Scapular truncation in triple mutants of Tbx15, Alx4 and Cart1 indicates essential functions for Alx4 and Cart1 in the anterior part of the scapula  Ectopic expression of Cart1 in transgenic mice does not disturb development, whereas expression of a Cart1 form from which the aristaless domain has been deleted results in severe cranial and vertebral malformations. Cart1, is essential for correct morphogenesis of the limbs and cranium.

53318685d6d3ac6a3400003d	What is the mode of inheritance of Acromicric dysplasia?	AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and skeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). Finally, WMS is transmitted either by an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance, GD by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and AD by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.  The condition appeared to be sporadic in 16 cases but the observation of vertical transmission in three families was consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.	['autosomal dominant']
5e6de3f21af46fc130000022	What is the target of the drug remdesivir?	We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.  Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.  In non-human primates, early initiation of polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and remdesivir improves survival, but whether they could be effective in patients is unknown.	['polymerase']
56c5c7915795f9a73e000004	Where does CTCF colocalize with cohesin?	In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.  In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.  Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels. Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.   To determine the functional importance of the binding of CTCF and cohesins at the three imprinted loci, CTCF and cohesins were depleted in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Results of these experiments demonstrate an unappreciated role for CTCF and cohesins in the repression of imprinted genes in somatic cells. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We conclude that cohesin subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene regulation and chromatin organization. Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci. In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Here, we show that ATRX, MeCP2, and cohesin, chromatin regulators implicated in ATR-X, RTT, and CdLS syndromes, respectively, interact in the brain and colocalize at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) with preferential binding on the maternal allele. Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle.  ChIP sequencing was performed on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at ~60 sites throughout the V(H) region and 2 other sites within the Igh locus.  Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus.  CTCF colocalizes with cohesin but not RNA Polymerase II.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci.

5173bdb38ed59a060a000020	How many TAp73 isoforms have been identified in humans?	A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. Transcription from two different promoters on the p73 gene results in generation of transcriptionally active TAp73 isoforms and dominant negative DeltaNp73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type. The role of various p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis has been controversial. However, as we have recently shown, the generation of TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mice reveals that TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp-73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p73 isoforms, TAp73(-/-) mice show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors. Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (deltaN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionaly active TAp73, as well as a dominant-negatively acting DeltaNp73 transcript isoforms. Since some mutant p53 proteins and ΔNp73 isoforms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentially act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. p73 is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms, both of which are implicated in tumor suppression and/or promotion. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. p73 possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter controlling the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 isoforms and the anti-apoptotic ΔΝp73 isoforms respectively. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of two N-terminal isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, in medulloblastoma cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, to lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. The p73 gene possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter, resulting in TAp73 and DeltaNup73 isoforms, respectively. Mice with a complete deficiency of p73 have severe neurological and immunological defects due to the absence of all TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. Moreover, we also found that subcellular location of p73 isoforms changes with the culture density increases. Moreover, ectopic expression of DeltaNp73alpha (but not other p73 isoforms) increased alphaB-crystallin mRNA levels in the absence of p53. Like wt p53, TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms transactivate target genes that activate apoptosis signaling pathways. The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. In contrast, antiapoptotic DeltaNp73 isoforms lack the TA domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. The isoforms TAp63 and TAp73 transactivate p53 target genes and induce apoptosis, whereas the isoforms DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73 lack transactivation and might have dominant-negative effects in p53 family members. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated in tumors. Consequently, different p73 isoforms can be degraded by calpains, i.e., both N-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and DeltaNp73) as well as the C-terminal isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Variants lacking the TA domain (DeltaN isoforms) are induced by TAp73 and by p53, and inhibit their transcriptional activity. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). Interestingly, expression of the Delta Np73 is strongly up-regulated by the TA isoforms and by p53, thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of TAp73 and more importantly of p53.

DeepCpG: accurate prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning. Recent technological advances have enabled DNA methylation to be assayed at single-cell resolution. However, current protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage and hence methods to predict missing methylation states are critical to enable genome-wide analyses. We report DeepCpG, a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict methylation states in single cells.

52bf1f2d03868f1b06000015	Which drug is benserazide usually co-administered with?	The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats.  Co-administration of L-Dopa with peripheral DDC inhibitors (carbidopa or benserazide) is the most effective symptomatic treatment for PD. In experiment 1, l-DOPA-primed rats were pre-treated with Vehicle (0.9% NaCl), various doses of the partial 5-HT(1A) agonist, buspirone (0.25, 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg, ip) or buspirone (2.5 mg/kg, ip)+the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg, ip) 5 min prior to l-DOPA (12 mg/kg+15 mg/kg benserazide, ip). R L-DOPA induced hyperalgesia occurred after conversion to dopamine because co-administration of benserazide, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, completely abolished the L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia.  First, animals were treated with levodopa (50 mg/kg with benserazide 12.5 mg/kg, twice daily), intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 22 days.  Chronic L-DOPA-treated rats received the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg; i.p.), the D2 receptor antagonist Eticlopride (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg; i.p.), a mixture of both antagonists (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg each; i.p.), or vehicle 30 min prior to L-DOPA (6 mg/kg; i.p.)+Benserazide (15 mg/kg; i.p.). Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.) They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-Dopa methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-Dopa/benserazide) alone or in combination with JL-18 (at the doses of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.9 mg/kg, s.c.). The administration of L-dopa (20 and 60 mg/kg p.o.) + benserazide (15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in dose-dependent increase of dialysate levels of L-dopa and 3-O-methyl-DOPA. Tolcapone (30 mg/kg p.o.), given as adjunct to both doses of L-dopa, markedly enhanced the elevation or extracellular L-dopa, while it completely prevented the formation of 3-O-methyl-DOPA. In another experiment, the administration of L-dopa + benserazide (30 + 15 mg/kg p.o.) resulted in increased extracellular levels of dopamine, DOPAC, HVA and 3-methoxytyramine. In healthy subjects and in patients with parkinsonism plasma ALAAD level fell after administration of L-dopa + benserazide, but returned to previous levels within 90 min. In a cross-sectional study blood was obtained, 2 h after dosing, from 104 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, divided into four groups: no L-dopa treatment (group 1), L-dopa alone (group 2), L-dopa + benserazide (Madopar) (group 3) and L-dopa + carbidopa (Sinemet) (group 4).

52f89fc62059c6d71c000050	From which tissue was the NCI-H520 cell-line derived?	The nanostructures target the cells with high affinity and specificity via the specific interaction between the aptamer (a 45-base oligonucleotide) and the cell, and distinguish A549 cells from other types of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7 cells) and subtypes of lung cancer cells (NCI-H157, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H446 cells).  Functional studies in A549 bronchioalveolar carcinoma and NCI-H520 squamous cell carcinoma cells revealed that Msi1 was enriched in spheroid cultures of tumor cells and in the CD133+ cell population.  BHLHB3 gene overexpression inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells.  Cellular proliferation was inhibited in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and SK-MES-1 by CTGF overexpression. Human NCI-H520 cancer cells transfected with PDCD5 cDNA showed decreased colony-forming ability.  In 4 lung cancer cell strains, BNIP3L protein was not detected in A549, NCI-H460, NCI-H446, except for NCI-H520, in which the protein expression level was slightly lower than that in immortal bronchial epithelial cell strain HBE4-E6/E7. We show that CLN3 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in glioblastoma (U-373G and T98g), neuroblastoma (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), prostate (Du145, PC-3, and LNCaP), ovarian (SK-OV-3, SW626, and PA-1), breast (BT-20, BT-549, and BT-474), and colon (SW1116, SW480, and HCT 116) cancer cell lines but not in pancreatic (CAPAN and As-PC-1) or lung (A-549 and NCI-H520) cancer cell lines. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H520 and H460, which have no endogenous Cyr61, formed 60-90% fewer colonies after being transfected with a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector than cells transfected with the same amount of empty vector. Importantly, the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines expressed either liver-specific (non-neuronal) mRNA (cell line A549) or predominantly the neuronal (cell line NCI-H520) AADC message.  The antitumor effect of CGP41251 (4'-N-benzoyl staurosporine), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, was examined on two kinds of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (adenocarcinoma: A549 and squamous cell carcinoma: NCI-H520).

58a3428d60087bc10a00001b	What gene is mutated in Huntington's disease?	Huntington disease (HD; OMIM 143100), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG (polyQ) motif in the HTT gene. Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a genetic mutation that results in polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal regions of huntingtin. Mutations of the huntingtin protein (HTT) gene underlie both adult-onset and juvenile forms of Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Huntington disease is a monogenic, autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene; age of onset of clinical symptoms inversely correlates with expanded CAG repeat length The causative gene (mutated HTT) is widely expressed outside the CNS and several peripheral signs of disease, including weight loss and increased proinflammatory signalling, are often seen; however, their importance in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease is not clear. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single-gene mutation: a CAG expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that results in production of a mutated protein, mutant HTT, with a polyglutamine tail (polyQ-HTT). Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Despite the characterization of the IT15 gene and the mutation involved in the disease, the normal function of huntingtin and the effects of the mutation on its function and on its neuronal location remain unknown. To study whether mutated huntingtin has the same neuronal distribution and intracellular location as normal huntingtin, we analyzed immunohistochemically both forms of this protein in the brain of 5 controls and 5 patients with Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Despite the characterization of the IT15 gene and the mutation involved in the disease, the normal function of huntingtin and the effects of the mutation on its function and on its neuronal location remain unknown. Huntingtons disease (HD) is a hereditary disorder involving the central nervous system. Its effects are devastating, to the affected person as well as his family. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to an excessive number of CAG repeats in the IT15 gene on chromosome 4.

Muscular complaints are known side-effects of statin therapy, ranging from myalgia to clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis.   the statin use and association with the presence and characteristics of muscular complaints. n the studied set of patients muscular symptoms were a rather frequent effect of statin therapy.  yopathy is included among the potential side-effects and toxicities associated with the lipid lowering agents, particularly 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. However, the precise mechanism of statin-induced muscle toxicity remains unclear. Lipid lowering drugs, such as statins, are commonly used to treat approximately 10 million Canadians affected by hypercholesterolemia. The most commonly experienced side-effect of statin medication is muscle pain Statin induced myopathy consists of a spectrum of myopathic disorders ranging from mild myalgia to fatal rhabdomyolysis  The following is a presentation of 2 cases of statin induced myopathy in patients  In addition, discussion will surround the mechanism, predisposing risk factors and frequency of statin induced myopathy Rhabdomyolysis is a known, rare serious side effect of statin monotherapy and of statin-fibrate combination therapy. Statin use is associated with a variety of overtly related muscle symptoms including muscle pain, myalgia, creatine kinase elevations without pain with myolysis and myositis (rhabdomyolysis), a potentially fatal side effect that led to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001. CYP2D6*4 polymorphism is associated with statin-induced muscle effects. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. The drugs which most frequently induce muscular side effects are steroids, statins, fibrates, antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants, colchicine, amiodarone, and anticancer drugs. Muscular side effects of various anesthetics, analgetics, antibiotics, antihistaminic drugs, antiretrovirals, cardiotropics, immunosuppressants, lipid-lowering drugs, psychotropic drugs, anticancer drugs, and other substances are more frequent than assumed and are easily overlooked. Muscle pain is a frequent adverse effect of statins. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with lipid-lowering drugs. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal Myopathy caused by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) alone is rare, but occurs more frequently when a statin is used with gemfibrozil, a medication that likely has a direct toxic effect on muscles. Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs. Rhabdomyolysis from the combination of a statin and gemfibrozil: an uncommon but serious adverse reaction.	['statins']

55421398ccca0ce74b000001	What type of DNA repair pathways is initiated by AlkA glycosylase?	The Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein (AlkA) recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair pathway. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two paralogues of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, Mag1p and Mag2p, which share homology with Escherichia coli AlkA. To clarify the function of these redundant enzymes in base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage Escherichia coli alkA tagA double mutants, which are deficient in the repair of alkylated bases. AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, is structurally homologous to endo III. We have now identified a shared active site motif amongst these three proteins. Using this motif as a protein database searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions. Alkylation damage is removed by the action of DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway Enzymatic repair of 5-formyluracil. I. Excision of 5-formyluracil site-specifically incorporated into oligonucleotide substrates by alka protein (Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II).

51631154298dcd4e5100004e	What disease is Velcade (bortezomib) mainly used for?	patients with multiple myeloma (MM) bortezomib, and lenalidomide have shown improved outcomes in these patients. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor drug very effective against multiple myeloma, may induce the so-called bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN), hardly manageable with common analgesic drugs. bortezomib have emerged as effective treatment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). the use of thalidomide to treat multiple myeloma, and describe problems arising in the Thaled® outpatient department. METHODS: Multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide at Hitachi General Hospital. Thalidomide showed some success in treating multiple myeloma either after auto-PBSCT or following treatment with bortezomib. In the case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), grave complications could have very easily developed, thus underscoring the importance of careful monitoring. Patients aged ≥18 years with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for 3 cycles. In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, co-administration of rifampicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the exposure to bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles. we provide data comparing sFLC with M protein as biomarkers of response in newly diagnosed patients with MM undergoing induction therapy with the novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and/or bortezomib. Bortezomib, indicated for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, is available in 3.5-mg vials, a quantity higher than the average dose commonly prescribed. Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid and potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is remarkably effective against multiple myeloma (MM) but not against solid tumors. efficacy and safety of bortezomib (BOR) for treatment of multiple myeloma in comparison with thalidomide (THAL) by reference to adverse events, and searched for laboratory markers that could be used for prognostication of patients. BOR showed a higher rate of effectiveness than THAL for refractory multiple myeloma, and its effects were rapid. BOR treatment prolonged the survival time of THAL-resistant patients. The efficacy of BOR was unrelated to patient age, the number of previous therapeutic regimens, or the disease period. It is suggested that BOR has therapeutic efficacy for multiple myeloma as a first-line medical treatment and/or for patients with THAL resistance, and can improve prognosis and survival. Since serum ALP elevation was observed in many patients for whom BOR was effective, this may be a predictor of BOR efficacy. Bortezomib-treated MM patients whose tumours had high baseline expression of genes suppressed by LCQ195 had significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival than those with low levels of these transcripts in their MM cells. These observations provide insight into the biological relevance of multi-targeted CDK inhibition in MM. bortezomib is the only effective agent in the treatment of plasma cell leukemia (PCL), a type of plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by poor prognosis despite conventional chemotherapy including autologous and allogeneic transplantation. These 3 patients with primary or secondary PCL who received a bortezomib-based regimen as rescue medication did not respond to treatment. To evaluate the effects and safety of the regimen of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone (VD) in the treatment of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis. VD regimen might be an efficient, rapid effective and safe regimen in the treatment of AL amyloidosis. Bortezomib (BZM) is a proteasome inhibitor in clinical use for multiple myeloma. Here, we investigated whether the combination of these compounds would yield increased antitumor efficacy in multiple myeloma and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have the potential to negate the therapeutic efficacy of BZM and suggest that consumption of green tea products may be contraindicated during cancer therapy with BZM. Relapsed/refractory myeloma has a poor outcome because of multi-drug resistance, patient low-performance status and toxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Bortezomib, by inhibiting proteasome function, may enhance chemosensitivity to other drugs and overcome drug-resistance. Notably, doxorubicin and bortezomib may reciprocally increase their efficacy. Thus, to improve outcome whilst minimizing therapy-related toxicity, liposomal doxorubicin was added to a bortezomib-based combination. the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with anti-EGFR drugs, such as gefitinib, vandetanib, and cetuximab in EGFR-expressing human cancer cell lines. Bortezomib determined dose-dependent growth inhibition in a nine cancer cell line panel (IC(50) values, range 6-42 nM). overexpression of a constitutively active P-Akt protected A549 cells by cell growth inhibition and apoptosis following treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors. The combined treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors has a synergistic growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity in different human cancer cells which possess a functional EGFR-dependent autocrine growth pathway through to a more efficient and sustained inhibition of Akt. Among 19 patients with breast cancer, four had evidence of a clinical benefit. Pre-clinical studies combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with anthracyclines have shown enhanced anti-tumor activity. We conducted a phase I trial of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with refractory solid tumors. A regimen of bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with PLD, 30 mg/m(2), on day 4 of a 21-day cycle, was safe in this study, and merits further investigation. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been used for patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia. Bortezomib, a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, has shown clinical activity in relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma in a pivotal Phase II trial, SUMMIT. treatment with bortezomib results in meaningful long-term benefit for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), used in antineoplastic chemotherapy, must be diluted in NaCl 0.9% for injection and stored for no more than 3 hours in a syringe or 8 hours in a vial. Proteasome inhibitors, a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents, enhance the antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines in vitro and in vivo. We therefore sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PegLD). Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 from 0.90 to 1.50 mg/m2 and PegLD on day 4 at 30 mg/m2 to 42 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Antitumor activity was seen against multiple myeloma, with 8 of 22 evaluable patients having a complete response (CR) or near-CR, including several with anthracycline-refractory disease, and another 8 having partial responses (PRs). One patient with relapsed/refractory T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) achieved a CR, whereas 2 patients each with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell NHL had PRs. Bortezomib/PegLD was safely administered in this study with promising antitumor activity, supporting further testing of this regimen. These patients were treated with bortezomib variously combined with other drugs outside of clinical trials.	['multiple myeloma']

Screen-positive newborns and patients with high clinical suspicion for CF are always recommended to undergo confirmatory sweat chloride testing with interpretations based on updated reference intervals. BACKGROUND: Sweat chloride testing for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) involves sweat induction, collection and handling, and measurement in an analytical lab. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. In eighty-three patients (26.4%) CFTR mutational analysis was done without corresponding sweat chloride testing. Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing.  Objective: To conduct a descriptive analysis of the sweat test (ST), associating ST results with epidemiological data, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutations and reasons to indicate the ST, as well as correlating sweat sodium and sweat chloride concentrations in subjects. Conclusions: ST data showed wide variability dependent on age, sex, reason for examination indication, CFTR mutations, and weight of the collected sweat sample.  Sweat testing is a gold standard for diagnosis of CF patients as genetic mutation profile being heterozygous and unlikely to become diagnostic test.

Assessment of Correlation between Sweat Chloride Levels and Clinical Features of Cystic Fibrosis Patients.The diagnosis is often delayed and the disease is advanced in most patients at the time of diagnosis.  However, it provides ambiguous results for intermediate sweat chloride cases while not reflecting disease progression when classifying the complex CF disease spectrum given the pleiotropic effects of gene modifiers and environment. In cystic fibrosis (CF), sweat chloride concentration has been proposed as an index of CFTR function for testing systemic drugs designed to activate mutant CFTR. BACKGROUND Sweat chloride testing for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) involves sweat induction, collection and handling, and measurement in an analytical lab. OBJECTIVES Sweat chloride testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF).

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a distressing cause of infertility in young women. POI is heterogeneous with only a few causative genes having been discovered so far. Our objective was to determine the genetic cause of POI in a consanguineous Lebanese family with two affected sisters presenting with primary amenorrhoea and an absence of any pubertal development. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed. Whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband. Linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 7 where exome sequencing successfully identified a homozygous two base pair duplication (c.1947_48dupCT), leading to a truncated protein p.(Y650Sfs*22) in the STAG3 gene, confirming it as the cause of POI in this family. Exome sequencing combined with linkage analyses offers a powerful tool to efficiently find novel genetic causes of rare, heterogeneous disorders, even in small single families. This is only the second report of a STAG3 variant; the first STAG3 variant was recently described in a phenotypically similar family with extreme POI. Identification of an additional family highlights the importance of STAG3 in POI pathogenesis and suggests it should be evaluated in families affected with POI.

5a6f853ab750ff4455000055	Which disease can be diagnosed with the "probe to bone" test?	Clinical inflammatory signs, probe-to-bone test, and plain X-rays are postulated as the basic tests for clinical diagnosis when DFO is suspected.  In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected.  Diagnostic Accuracy of Probe to Bone to Detect Osteomyelitis in the Diabetic Foot: A Systematic Review. The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is a commonly used clinical test for osteomyelitis (OM), but its utility has been questioned in clinical settings where the prevalence of OM is low. This article aims to systematically review the accuracy of the PTB test to diagnose diabetic foot OM. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the PTB test was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], .75-.93) and 0.83 (95% CI, .65-.93), respectively. We conclude that the PTB test can accurately rule in diabetic foot OM in the high-risk patients and rule out OM in low-risk patients. Inter-observer reproducibility of diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis based on a combination of probe-to-bone test and simple radiography. Probe-to-bone test and simple X-rays are both standard tests for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. This study demonstrates the importance of considering jointly clinical information (probe-to-bone test) and diagnostic tests (simple radiography) to increase agreement among clinicians on diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity and specificity (90% and 79%) than plain radiography (54% and 68%) for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis. MRI performs somewhat better than any of several common tests--probe to bone (PTB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)>70 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP)>14 mg/L, procalcitonin>0.3 ng/mL, and ulcer size>2 cm²--although PTB has the highest specificity of any test and is commonly used together with MRI. AIMS: To investigate the accuracy of the sequential combination of the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the foot of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Overall, 72.4% of patients had histologically proven osteomyelitis, 85.2% of whom had positive bone culture. The performance characteristics of both the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays were excellent.  CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive.

Validating the probe-to-bone test and other tests for diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2, a positive probe-to-bone test result, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h, and an abnormal plain radiograph result are helpful in diagnosing the presence of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is a commonly used clinical test for osteomyelitis (OM), but its utility has been questioned in clinical settings where the prevalence of OM is low.

We sought to assess the accuracy of the probe-to-bone (PTB) test in diagnosing foot osteomyelitis in a cohort of diabetic patients with bone culture proven disease. Probe-to-bone test for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis: reliable or relic? Validating the probe-to-bone test and other tests for diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis: is the combination of probe-to-bone test and plain radiography sufficient for high-risk inpatients? To investigate the accuracy of the sequential combination of the probe-to-bone test and plain X-rays for diagnosing osteomyelitis in the foot of patients with diabetes. Clinicians seeing patients in a setting similar to ours (specialized diabetic foot unit with a high prevalence of osteomyelitis) can confidently diagnose diabetic foot osteomyelitis when either the probe-to-bone test or a plain X-ray, or especially both, are positive.. Probe-to-bone test and simple X-rays are both standard tests for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis.	['diabetic foot osteomyelitis']

We report a case of unilateral phthiriasis palpebrarum with crab louse.  BACKGROUND: Pediculosis capitis is a common parasitic infestation, whereas phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon infection due to Phthirus pubis (pubic lice) inoculating the eyelashes and surrounding tissues of the eye.  Head lice typically do not infect the eyes, and given the different morphology of the lice on the patient's head and eyes, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made.  P. pubis can cause pruritic eyelid margins or unusual blepharoconjunctivitis. We present a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 4-year-old boy. INTRODUCTION: Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an ectoparasitosis in which Phthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. In all cases, the diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was confirmed by parasitological examination of eyelashes, which revealed the presence of adult and nit forms of Phthirus pubis.  Based on the observation of numerous nits at the base of the eyelashes and the ectoparasite in the palpebral margin, a diagnosis of phthiriasis palpebrarum was made. Phthiriasis palpebrarum (lice infestation of palpabrae) is a rarely reported disorder and may present as blepharoconjuctivitis.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis. Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Phthirus pubis, is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis; therefore, this condition is easily misdiagnosed Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an unusual cause of blepharoconjunctivitis and may easily be overlooked because of the failure of physicians to recognize Phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum (PP) is a rare eyelid infestation caused by phthirus pubis Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by the phthirus pubis, is a rare cause of blepharoconjunctivitis, and is therefore often neglected.  Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an infestation of the eyelashes caused by the louse Pthirus pubis (Linnaeus, 1758).

Three members of a family who died with renal amyloidosis were found to share a single nucleotide substitution in the fibrinogen alpha-chain gene.  A French kindred with autosomal dominant hereditary renal amyloidosis was found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen Aalpha-chain gene. Two families with hereditary renal amyloidosis were found to have a novel mutation in the fibrinogen A alpha chain gene. The predominant cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis is a mutation of the fibrinogen Aalpha chain (AFib), the most common being the E526V mutation. Discovery of this new mutation confirms the association between fibrinogen A alpha chain variant and hereditary renal amyloidosis and establishes a new biochemical subtype of amyloidosis.

5e61425e1af46fc13000000d	Roughly how many base pairs are in the human mitochondrial genome or mtDNA?	The 16569 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA  BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are increasingly being recognized in many human cancers, but automated sequencing of 16.5 kb of DNA poses an onerous task. The human mitochondrial genome consists of a multicopy, circular dsDNA molecule of 16,569 base pairs. In addition to the 3 billion base pair nuclear genome, each human cell contains thousands of copies of a small, 16.5 kb circular molecule of double stranded DNA: mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) which generally accounts for only 1% of the total cellular nucleic acid content. The ntrast, human cells contain hundreds to thousands of copies of a ca.16 kB mtDNA genome tightly packed with 13 protein-coding genes along with rRNA and tRNA genes required for their expression. The  Human mitochondria harbor an essential, high copy number, 16,569 base pair, circular DNA genome that encodes 13 gene products required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. M The small (16,569 base pair) human mitochondrial genome plays a significant role in cell metabolism and homeostasis. Human mitochondria harbor an essential, high copy number, 16,569 base pair, circular DNA genome that encodes 13 gene products required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a circular double-stranded DNA genome of ~16.5 kilobase pairs (kb) that encodes 13 catalytic proteins of the ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), and the rRNAs and tRNAs required for the translation of the mtDNA transcripts. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a circular, double-stranded, 16,569-base paired DNA containing 37 genes: 13 proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs; 12S and 16S), and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The mitochondrial genome of humans and most vertebrates is approximately 16.5kbp, double-stranded, circular, with few non-coding bases. In humans, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a 16,569-bp double-stranded circular molecule, encoding 37 genes, and is exclusively transmitted from the mother. They are maternally inherited and in humans contain a 16,569-base-pair circular genome (mtDNA) encoding 37 genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from single base pair changes in the 16.5 kilobase pair genome up to large deletions and rearrangements. In contrast, human cells contain hundreds to thousands of copies of a ca.16 kB mtDNA genome tightly packed with 13 protein-coding genes along with rRNA and tRNA genes required for their expression. For comprehensive mutation scanning of the whole 16.569 bp human mitochondrial genome, we developed a set of 67 primer pairs defining overlapping PCR fragments that are well suited for heteroduplex analysis. Human mitochondrial DNA, the 25th chromosome, is a 16 569 base pair long circular molecule, that encoders a variety of genes for the translational machinery of the mitochondrion, as well as 13 structural proteins, that are all subunits of the respiratory chain (RC). Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from single base changes in the 16.5 kilobase-pair genome up to large deletions and rearrangements.	['16569 bps']
5314bd7ddae131f847000006	Which hormone receptor function is altered in patients with Donohue syndrome?	This disease is caused by a defective insulin receptor and features abnormal glucose metabolism and retarded intrauterine and postnatal growth. Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS).  Severe progressive obstructive cardiomyopathy and renal tubular dysfunction in Donohue syndrome with decreased insulin receptor autophosphorylation due to a novel INSR mutation. Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism; OMIM *246200) is a rare, recessively inherited disorder of extreme insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) causing either defects in insulin binding or receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity. Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome): a case bearing novel compound heterozygous mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) is the most severe type of insulin receptor (INSR) gene anomaly with the majority of patients surviving for only 2 years. A novel mutation of the insulin receptor gene in a preterm infant with Donohue syndrome and heart failure. Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the gene encoding the insulin receptor. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance, including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, which differ in the level of severity.  Donohue syndrome in a neonate with homozygous deletion of exon 3 of the insulin receptor gene. Donohue syndrome describes the clinical consequences of the most severe genetic loss of insulin receptor function. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within the insulin binding domain of the human insulin receptor (INSR) are usually associated with severe impairment of insulin binding leading to Donohue syndrome ("Leprechaunism"), which is characterized by excessive hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, distinct dysmorphism and early death.  The former mutation has been described in homozygous form in Donohue syndrome, while the latter is novel. 	['insulin receptor']

5c990241ecadf2e73f00002d	What is the function of the transcriptional co-activator p300?	The transcriptional co-activator p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that is typically recruited to transcriptional enhancers and regulates gene expression by acetylating chromatin. p300, a transcriptional co-activator with histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to multiple pro-hypertrophic stimuli including hyperglycemia.

6028183e1cb411341a0000f1	Which subcortical brain structure is influenced the most by common genetic variants?	The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.	['Putamen']
5c34ad63da8336e21a000007	Which genomic positions are preferentially selected for transposon insertion?	These results suggest that in Drosophila preferential insertion sites may be defined with the contribution of host factors, although alternative interpretations are also possible.  These data support the hypothesis that Tn916 has a marked preference for insertion into noncoding DNA for H. influenzae, suggesting that this mobile element has evolved to minimize disruption of host cell function on integration. Preferential integration points in the rye genome exist, because the new insertions seem to be located, in all studied cases, in the same genome positions.  However, a similar approach did not reveal any structural pattern of DNA that could be used to predict favored integration sites for other transposons as well as retroviruses and lentiviruses due to a limitation of available data sets. The FISH analysis of the pepper Tat elements showed a random distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato Tat elements showed heterochromatin-preferential accumulation No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed.

5c7a4fddd774d04240000009	How rare are CTCs (circulating tumour cells) in the plasma of patients?	We have focused on breast cancer as most clinical studies on CTC detection so far have been done in these patients. However, largely because of the extremely low number of CTCs (as low as 1 in 10(9) hematologic cells) in the blood of patients, effective detection and separation of the rare cells remain a tremendous challenge. However, selective capture and quantification of CTCs from whole blood was still full of challenge due to the extremely scare number of CTCs. Finally, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples and as low as one CTC in the whole blood was captured and identified by the ICC method.

5a67ab79b750ff445500000b	CURB65 score is used for stratification of which disease?	Severity assessment tools (e.g. CURB65) that are used to guide early management decisions in CAP have not been widely validated in low-income settings and locally adapted tools are required.  Scores for the pneumonia severity index (PSI); CURB65 (confusion, urea, respiration, blood pressure; age>65 years); Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for severe CAP; Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); and quick SOFA (qSOFA) were calculated. Prognostic performance of MR-pro-adrenomedullin in patients with community acquired pneumonia in the Emergency Department compared to clinical severity scores PSI and CURB. AIM: (i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification.  The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA.  The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. The CURB65 pneumonia severity score outperforms generic sepsis and early warning scores in predicting mortality in community-acquired pneumonia. CURB65 should not be supplanted by SIRS or SEWS for initial prognostic assessment in CAP. The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. We aimed to derive a practical algorithm combining the CURB65 score with ProADM-levels in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-CAP-LRTI. RESULTS CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI. The combined CURB65-A risk score provided better prediction of death and adverse events than the CURB65 score in the entire cohort and in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI patients. CONCLUSION Presepsin is a valuable biomarker in predicting severity and outcome in CAP patients in the ED and Presepsin in combination with CURB65 score significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy. BACKGROUND An intervention trial found a trend for shorter length of stay (LOS) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when the CURB65 score was combined with the prognostic biomarker proadrenomedullin (ProADM) (CURB65-A). A composite score (CURB65-A) was created combining CURB65 classes with ProADM cut-offs to further risk-stratify patients.<br><b>RESULTS</b>: CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI.

5719f5c67de986d80d00000d	What distinguishes lantibiotics from antibiotics?	One potentially interesting class of antimicrobials are the modified bacteriocins termed lantibiotics, which are bacterially produced, posttranslationally modified, lanthionine/methyllanthionine-containing peptides. low levels of resistance have been reported for lantibiotics compared with commercial antibiotics Mechanisms that hinder the action of lantibiotics are often innate systems that react to the presence of any cationic peptides/proteins or ones which result from cell well damage, rather than being lantibiotic specific. Lantibiotics are biologically active peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria.  Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Lantibiotic compounds are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides against which bacteria are not able to produce resistance, hence making them a good alternative to antibiotics. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics that are posttranslationally modified to introduce (methyl)lanthionine bridges. Lantibiotics are defined as peptide antibiotics containing the unusual amino acids mesolanthionine, 3-methyllanthionine, dehydroalanine, and dehydrobutyrine. Lantibiotics are antibiotic peptides distinguished by the presence of the rare thioether amino acids lanthionine and/or methyllanthionine. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified, peptide antibiotics containing unusual amino acids such as dehydrated amino acids and lanthionine. Lantibiotics are peptide antibiotics, realizing their unique secondary structure by posttranslational modifications, the most important one being the formation of the characteristic amino acid lanthionine. Lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics.  Lantibiotics, a group of lanthionine-containing peptides, display their antibiotic activity by combining different killing mechanisms within one molecule.  Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized as prepeptides, which are posttranslationally modified.	['Lantibiotics are post-translationally modified natural peptides containing lanthionine']

58a342e760087bc10a00001c	Can you define iatrogenic disease?	Iatrogenic neurologic deficits after lumbar spine surgery are rare complications, but important to recognize and manage. However, we analyze its etiology in order to determine if it is from iatrogenic causes. This syndrome can be categorized as follows: mistaken diagnoses, transoperative error, technique error, poor application, poor indication However, the clinical events that occur during iatrogenic immunosuppression (transplantation and cancer therapy) and as a result of immunocompromise due to human immunodeficiency virus infection are currently promoting our understanding of the epidemiology of CMV disease and the definition of its clinical spectrum The authors observed one case of an iatrogenic subarachnoid-pleural fistula secondary to the resection of an upper lobe carcinoma of the lung. Radiological procedures require the intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media, which are becoming a great source of an iatrogenic disease known as contrast-induced nephropathy.  Many studies have reported that AED therapy is associated with metabolic bone disease and is a major iatrogenic risk factor for fractures.  The aetiology of arrhythmias can be either iatrogenic, such as postsurgical, Iatrogenic diseases are defined as illnesses due to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice.  Iatrogenic diseases are defined as illnesses due to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.  Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice.To study and evaluate major cardiac iatrogenic disease as the cause of admission to the intensive cardiac care unit in the modern era.We assessed 64 critically ill patients suffering from major cardiac iatrogenic problems among a total of 2,559 patients admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit during 3 years. Iatrogenic disease was defined as adverse drug reactions according to the World Health Organization Definition and complications induced by non-drug medical interventions. Iatrogenic illness, defined as a disease that results from a diagnostic procedure or from any form of therapy, is a well-recognized phenomenon in clinical practice. Iatrogenic illness was defined as any problem that resulted from therapy. An iatrogenic event was defined as "an adverse event related to a medical procedure". Patients with colorectal cancer who had splenectomy as a result of iatrogenic damage of the spleen while undergoing resection of the sigmoid or rectum for adenocarcinoma had a significantly worse prognosis. Intraoperative aortic dissection remains a rare and unpredictable complication of cardiac surgery, with worse outcomes than spontaneous aortic dissection. Increased age and atheromatous disease at the site of cannulation are significant risk factors for iatrogenic dissection. In this series, off-pump coronary artery bypass did not appear to be a risk factor for iatrogenic aortic dissection  Iatrogenic injury to the spleen is not an uncommon complication. Left nephrectomy has been reported as the second commonest cause of iatrogenic splenectomy with a reported incidence between 1.3 and 24%. Iatrogenic splenectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.AIMS: We reviewed the occurrence of iatrogenic splenectomy during left nephrectomy at our centre. Hallux valgus is a common forefoot pathology often requiring surgical intervention for symptomatic relief. One complication of hallux valgus correction is flexible hallux varus. Iatrogenic flexible hallux varus often requires surgical repair; however, the most advantageous surgical procedure for repair of iatrogenic flexible hallux varus and their sustainability remains unclear The possible interrelationship between such deposition and cranial irradiation and/or i.t.

Prevention is the remedy for this iatrogenic problem. This report reviews both the medical and surgical literature during the past 15 years of patients treated for pseudomembranous colitis. Analysis of this clinical data has provided us with the opportunity to both define the role of surgery in this disorder and illustrate the necessity for a combined medical and surgical cooperative approach in the early management of this iatrogenic disease. Iatrogenic problems following gastric surgery. difficult to truly define iatrogenic complications in the postsurgical state in that the surgery is a condition originated by physician intervention and thus any problems that occur may be technically considered as physician created he most severe iatrogenic events were nosocomial infections (49/62 [79%]) and respiratory events (nine of 26 [35%]).

Eighteen, 17, and 12 patients were diagnosed at ages<40, 40-59, and ≥60 years, respectively Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosed in pediatric patients has been reported to have a more aggressive phenotype and course, with a greater prevalence of upper gastrointestinal involvement, than in adults. There was a significant association between body mass index and bone mineral density (P = 0.004) and a significant difference in the T scores of patients according to age at diagnosis (Montreal Classification: P = 0.0006) with patients diagnosed<17 years (n = 13) having lower T scores than those diagnosed at older age groups (n = 70). Increasing age of diagnosis was negatively associated with complicated disease and positively associated with colonic disease. As age of diagnosis increased, disease duration (P<0.001), family history of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (P = 0.015) and perianal disease decreased (P<0.0015).  Crohn's disease incidence rates in the 10-19-year age category increased by 71%, from 6.5 (1988-1990) to 11.1 (2006-2007) Consequently, studies on Crohn's disease risk factors should focus on the population under 20 years of age. For those with biologic use, average age at time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease was 32.3 ± 12.2 years, compared with 43.7 ± 16.3 years for those who had not received biologics (P = 0.005). Sixty one patients (50.4%) were 20-39 years old and 43 patients (35.5%) were 40 years and older. Colonic involvement was significantly more common (46,5%) in the 40 years and older group compared with 20-39 years group (24.6%) (p = 0.01) When the age-related incidence of Crohn's disease was plotted for all countries from which such data were available, the peaks of greatest case frequency occurred at ages 15 to 25 years and paralleled a similar peak representing the number of Peyer's patches as a function of age Crohn's disease has a bimodal age distribution of disease onset diagnosis. The peaks (20 and 50 years) may represent different phenotypes or different genetic and/or environmental influences between younger- and older-onset individuals.  Current therapy for CD in the UK is less likely than previously to involve the use of long-term glucocorticoids.WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Despite advances in therapy, short stature and slow growth continue to be encountered in children with CD.  There is a need for simple and consistent definitions of growth that can identify poor growth in children with chronic disease.METHODS: The anthropometric and treatment details of 116 children (68 male) with a mean (range) age at diagnosis of 10.8 years (4.9-15.5) and a mean age at maximum follow-up (MF) of 15.4 years (9.4-19.3) were studied retrospectively at diagnosis (T0), at 1 (T1), 2 (T2) and 3 years (T3) after diagnosis and at MF.RESULTS: At T0, mean height SD score (HtSDS) was -0.5 (-3.3 to 2.6) compared to a mid-parental HtSDS of 0.2 (-2.0 to 01.4) (p=0.002).  White patients were significantly more likely to have ileal disease, whereas African American patients were significantly more likely to have ileocolonic and colonic disease. Age at diagnosis younger than 40 years (odds ratio [OR] 4. Both age at diagnosis and site of CD involvement were independently associated with expression of ASCA and anti-CBir1.Compared to children 8-15 years of age at diagnosis, those 0-7 years are more likely to express anti-CBir1 but only half as likely to express ASCA.

51635202298dcd4e5100004f	How is myotonic dystrophy inherited?	Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder caused by a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion located in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 gene (ZNF9 gene) on chromosome 3q 21.3. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by an expansion of a CTG triplet repeat in the DMPK gene. Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder. DM is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, muscular dystrophy, myotonia, and multisystem involvement. Type 1 DM (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)(n) expansion in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK in 19q13.3. proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) and type 2 DM (DM2) but without the DM1 mutation, showed linkage to the 3q21 region and were recently shown to segregate a (CCTG)(n) expansion mutation in intron 1 of ZNF9. All patients have the DM2 (CCTG)(n) expansion. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular, degenerative and progressive disease, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. The worldwide intergenerational behavior of the DM1 mutation is similar in Costa Rica Dystrophic myotonia is a sufficiently rare disease inherited mainly by the autosomal dominant type.

Visualizations of biomolecular structures empower us to gain insights into biological functions, generate testable hypotheses, and communicate biological concepts. Typical visualizations (such as ball and stick) primarily depict covalent bonds. In contrast, non-covalent contacts between atoms, which govern normal physiology, pathogenesis, and drug action, are seldom visualized. We present the Protein Contacts Atlas, an interactive resource of non-covalent contacts from over 100,000 PDB crystal structures. We developed multiple representations for visualization and analysis of non-covalent contacts at different scales of organization: atoms, residues, secondary structure, subunits, and entire complexes. The Protein Contacts Atlas enables researchers from different disciplines to investigate diverse questions in the framework of non-covalent contacts, including the interpretation of allostery, disease mutations and polymorphisms, by exploring individual subunits, interfaces, and protein-ligand contacts and by mapping external information.

5339edd6d6d3ac6a34000061	Which is the clinical meaning of the presence of delayed enhancement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	The extent of regional myocardial fibrosis is associated with regional myocardial function independently of morphological changes of the myocardium, and the correlation extended to global LV function. Occurrence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with left atrial and ventricular dysfunction as well as with the severity of heart failure symptoms. Patients with symptomatic apical HCMshowed myocardial hyperenhancement involving the subendocardial layer, which might be related to regional systolic dysfunction, serious clinical symptoms, and ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, late gadolinium enhancement was associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmic risk factors, and worse New York Heart Association class. The presence of DE was related to occurrence of heart failure symptoms (P=0.05) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P=0.001). DE (7%+/-7% of left ventricle) was present in 54 patients who were asymptomatic (and with normal ejection fraction).  In HCM, the DE was associated with higher NYHA classes and prevalence of VT, impaired global LV function and asymmetrical hypertrophy, and conduction disturbance, abnormal Q waves, and giant negative T waves.  In myocardial segments exhibiting DCE, hMBF is reduced. DCE extent is inversely correlated and hMBF directly correlated with systolic thickening. In segments without DCE but contiguous to DCE areas, hMBF is significantly lower than in those remote from DCE and is similar to the value obtained in nontransmural DCE segments. These results suggest that increasing degrees of coronary microvascular dysfunction might play a causative role for myocardial fibrosis in HCM. In this large HCM cohort with no or only mild symptoms, myocardial fibrosis detected by CMR was associated with greater likelihood and increased frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including NSVT) on ambulatory Holter ECG. Therefore, contrast-enhanced CMR identifies HCM patients with increased susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

5e2902e48b3851296d000006	Which disease can be treated with Anifrolumab?	OBJECTIVES: In a post-hoc analysis, we aimed to validate the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) definition as an endpoint in an systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Phase IIb randomised controlled trial (RCT) (MUSE [NCT01438489]) and then utilize LLDAS to discriminate between anifrolumab and placebo CONCLUSIONS: LLDAS attainment represents a clinically meaningful SLE outcome measure, and anifrolumab is associated with more patients who met LLDAS criteria versus placebo.  A post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two Phase IIb trials (sifalimumab; NCT01283139, anifrolumab; NCT01438489) assessed the clinical significance of a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index (SRI(4)) response (Week 52) for 736 patients with moderate to severe SLE disease activity (study entry).  Objectives: To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous anifrolumab, an anti-type I interferon receptor monoclonal antibody in development for SLE, in healthy volunteers. Characterisation of anifrolumab, a fully human anti-interferon receptor antagonist antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Objective: We investigated the mechanistic and pharmacological properties of anifrolumab, a fully human, effector-null, anti-type I interferon (IFN) alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) monoclonal antibody in development for SLE. Conclusions: Anifrolumab potently inhibits type I IFN-dependent signalling, including the type I IFN autoamplification loop, and is a promising therapeutic for patients with SLE and other diseases that exhibit chronic dysfunctional type I IFN signalling. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a polymorphic presentation. The variability in the clinical expression and severity of SLE makes new treatments both essential and challenging to develop. Several biotherapies targeting different pathophysiological pathways have been developed over the past 15 years. The results of Phase II trials were encouraging but rarely borne out by Phase III trials. Recent data, which are discussed in detail in this review, allowed belimumab - a monoclonal antibody against BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) - to become the first biotherapy approved for use in SLE. Other molecules targeting B cells include the two anti-BLyS antibodies tabalumab and blisibimod; atacicept, which targets both BLyS and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand); and the monoclonal antibody to CD22 epratuzumab. The rekindling of interest in the B-cell pathway has also driven new clinical research into rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 with evaluations of new strategies. A new and promising approach is the use of inhibitors of the type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway, of which the most promising is anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 IFN receptor. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab, a type I interferon (IFN) receptor antagonist, in a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CONCLUSION: Anifrolumab substantially reduced disease activity compared with placebo across multiple clinical end points in the patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.

5cebf83ea49efeb44c00000a	Are male or female persons more prone to autoimmunity?	 Estrogens cause a marked acceleration of autoimmunity and a reduction in thymus weight.  we found that a number of problems or variables arise in studying sex hormone effects, including: 1) X-linked genes, 2) metabolism of testosterone to estrogens, 3) dose of hormone, 4) age at which administration is initiated, 5) differential effects of sex hormones on different autoantibodies and various immune responses. Examples of this autoimmune dimorphism include (but are not limited to) lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis with the two former more prevalent in females than males and the latter more severe during pregnancy. Sex hormones have long been implicated in autoimmune diseases because women account for 80% of cases. Sex hormones have definitive roles in lymphocyte maturation, activation, and synthesis of antibodies and cytokines. Sex hormone expression is altered among patients with autoimmune disease, and this variation of expression contributes to immune dysregulation. ex hormones affect the function of the mammalian immune system, and sex hormone expression is different in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus than in healthy subjects. Sex hormones play a role in the genesis of autoimmunity. Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.  The gut microbiome, which impacts the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, not only influences the development of autoimmune disorders but may interact with sex-hormones to modulate disease progression and sex-bias. Recent studies investigating the origins of sex bias in autoimmune disease have revealed an extensive and interconnected network of genetic, hormonal, microbial, and environmental influences. Investigation of sex hormones has moved beyond profiling the effects of hormones on activity and prevalence of immune cell types to defining the specific immunity-related genes driving these changes	['Female']
5319a7d2b166e2b806000029	Which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase of Hsp90?	C-terminal Hsp-interacting protein (CHIP) is an HSP70 and HSP90 interacting co-chaperone and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Previous studies have reported the role of CHIP in cancer progression by targeting protein degradation. The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P are efficient and specific inhibitors of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) is believed to be a central player in the cellular triage decision, as it links the molecular chaperones Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 to the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation pathway. We found that CHIP has a sixfold higher affinity for Hsp90 compared with Hsc70. Carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) can remodel mature aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complexes and mediate ubiquitination of both the AhR and the 90 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp90) in vitro The analysis of the sucrose-gradient-fractionated in vitro translated AhR complexes revealed that CHIP can mediate hsp90 ubiquitination while cooperating with unidentified factors to promote the ubiquitination of mature unliganded AhR complexes.

58bde18b02b8c60953000014	What is the function of BAX	pro-apoptotic protein Bax Bax, a central cell death regulator, is an indispensable gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and a major proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins that control apoptosis in normal and cancer cells Thus, PP2A may function as a physiological Bax regulatory phosphatase that not only dephosphorylates Bax but also activates its proapoptotic function. The ability of the mutants to protect against Bax-mediated cell death is divided into three groups: (1) group I, retention of anti-Bax function in both the Val129 and Met129 mutants; (2) group II, retention of anti-Bax function only in Val129 mutants; and (3) group III, reduction or no anti-Bax function in Val129 and Met129 mutants. A popular model of BCL-2 and BAX involvement in apoptosis suggests that upon apoptosis induction cytosolic BAX translocates to the mitochondria, where it displays the pro-apoptotic function, which involves its homodimerization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of the gene coding for the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, the proapoptotic molecule Bax, and the apoptosis executor enzyme caspase-3 in preimplantation renal biopsies (PIB) as markers for delayed graft function.In this prospective single-center study, gene expression levels were evaluated using real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction in PIB of kidneys from 72 deceased donors (DDs) and 18 living donors (LDs).CASP3 and BAX expression levels were higher, whereas those of BCL2 were lower, in DD than in LD PIB The function Bax and/or Bak in constituting a gateway for mitochondrial apoptosis in response to apoptotic stimuli has been unequivocally demonstrated Bax is a major proapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family that is required for apoptotic cell death. Bax is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins which localizes to and uses mitochondria as its major site of action. death-promoting Bax protein The suppressors function through heterodimerization with the death promoters, Bax Bax- and Bak-mediated apoptosis severely limits adenoviral replication, Bax a pro-apoptotic member localizes as monomers in the cytosol of healthy cells and accumulates as oligomers in mitochondria of apoptotic cell Bax and Bak (Bax/Bak) are essential pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family that trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) in a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable manner. BAX protein plays a key role in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The multi-BCL-2 homology domain pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members BAK and BAX have critical roles in apoptosis. They are essential for mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabili Members of the Bcl-2 family play key roles as proapoptotic (e.g., Bax) and antiapoptotic (e.g., Bcl-x(L)) regulators of programmed cell death The Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), belonging to the Bcl-2 family, plays a pivotal role in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.

In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively. Of these agents, CD38-targeting antibodies have marked single agent activity in extensively pretreated MM, and preliminary results from studies with relapsed/refractory patients have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy when daratumumab and isatuximab are combined with other agents Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Neutralization of the therapeutic CD38 antibody or CD38 denaturation on reagent red blood cells mitigates daratumumab interference with transfusion laboratory serologic tests.

Amongst these antibodies, elotuzumab which targets SLAMF-7 and daratumumab which targets CD38, have been recently approved by FDA for patients with relapsed/refractory MM. This review focuses on the CD38 antigen and its targeting with daratumumab and provides an update on the results of recent clinical studies involving daratumumab. Targeting CD38 with Daratumumab Monotherapy in Multiple Myeloma. We assessed daratumumab, a novel CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a cell surface protein that is overexpressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Furthermore, daratumumab, and probably also other CD38-targeting antibodies, interfere with blood compatibility testing and thereby complicate the safe release of blood products. Daratumumab, a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Importantly, IFNγ was able to up-regulate CD38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab.	['CD38']
5c632542e842deac6700000d	Which approach was used to diagnose a patient with Cutis Verticis Gyrata-Intellectual Disability (CVG-ID) syndrome?	Cutis Verticis Gyrata-Intellectual Disability (CVG-ID) syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by intellectual disability and scalp folds and furrows that are typically absent at birth and are first noticed after puberty. First reported in 1893, the syndrome was mainly identified in subjects living in psychiatric institutions, where it was found to have a prevalence of up to 11.4%. Most patients were reported in the literature during the first half of the 20th century. CVG-ID is now a less reported and possibly under-recognized syndrome. Here, we report a patient with CVG-ID that was diagnosed using the novel approach of magnetic resonance imaging and we conduct a systematic review of all patients reported in the last 60 years, discussing the core clinical features of this syndrome.

5fd779b4a43ad31278000004	Which particular intersex phenotype is related to steroid reductase?	Gender identity and role in a pedigree of Arabs with intersex due to 5 alpha reductase-2 deficiency Between 1986 and 1995, a pedigree of six Arabs with male pseudohermaphroditism due to 5 alpha reductase-2 deficiency have been identified. In the 20 yr since it was established that impairment of dihydrotestosterone formation is the cause of a rare form of human intersex, a wealth of information has accumulated about the genetics, endocrinology, and variable phenotypic manifestations, culminating in the cloning of cDNAs encoding two 5 alpha-reductase genes and documentation that mutations in the steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 gene are the cause of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency. It is also imperative to establish whether defects in steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2, perhaps in the heterozygous state, are responsible for a portion of cases of sporadic hypospadias, to determine whether 5 alpha-reductase plays a role in progesterone action in women, and to elucidate the relation between androgen action and gender role behavior. Virilization of the external genitalia in the male fetus requires testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is formed from testosterone by the action of the enzyme, 5alpha-reductase type 2 (5alphaR-2). Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical spectrum ranges from a male phenotype with hypospadia to a female phenotype with normal wolffian structures Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is a rare disorder leading to male pseudohermaphroditism, a condition characterized by incomplete differentiation of male genitalia in 46,XY patients. H ch impairs DHT formation (mutation within the 5alphaR-2 gene or 5alphaR-2 inhibitors) or normal function of the AR (mutation in the AR gene, antiandrogens) may result in insufficient androgen action in the male fetus and in subsequent undervirilization in the newborn.

Sequencing of the entire SRY gene, incl In 1974, a lack of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), the most potent androgen across species except for fish, was shown to be the origin of a type of pseudohermaphrodism in which boys have female-like external genitalia. Molecular studies were focused on coding sequences of the SRY gene (case 1) and 2 candidates for monogenic hypospadias, namely MAMLD1 (mastermind-like domain containing 1) and SRD5A2 (steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2). None of the identified polymorphisms cosegregated with the intersexual phenotype, thus, we cannot confirm that hypospadias may be associated with polymorphism in the coding sequence of the studied genes. This animal was classified as a compound sex reversal (78,XX, SRY-negative) with the hypospadias syndrome. Hypospadias in a male (78,XY; SRY-positive) dog and sex reversal female (78,XX; SRY-negative) dogs: clinical, histological and genetic studies. Hence, steroid 5 alpha-reductase deficiency should be considered not only in sex reversed patients with female or ambiguous phenotypes, but also in those with mild symptoms of undermasculinization as encountered in patients with hypospadias and/or micropenis. Phenotypic classification of male pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. A classification based on the severity of the masculinization defect may be used for correlation of phenotypes with enzyme activities and genotypes, and for comparisons of phenotypes between different patients as the basis for clinical decisions to be made in patients with pseudohermaphroditism due to steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. Inactivating mutations of the 5α-steroid reductase type-2 (SRD5A2) gene result in a broad spectrum of masculinization defects, ranging from a male phenotype with hypospadias to a female phenotype with Wolffian structures.

In-hospital cardiogenic shock (15% vs 3% in the control group; p<0.01) and death (7% vs 1% in the control group; p<0.01) were more frequently observed in the thyroid dysfunction group.  Thyroid dysfunction, particularly sick euthyroid syndrome, was found to be related to in-hospital and long term mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention. A low fT3 level, a common phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarctions, is a strong predictor of short-term and long-term poor prognoses in patients with acute myocardial infarctions. Troponin T and creatine kinase-B with an M-type subunit levels were significantly higher in the nonsurvivors when compared with survivors. Survivors in the AMI group had higher TT3, TT4, and lower FT4 levels, while the nonsurvivors in the AMI group had higher thyrotrophin and lower TT3, FT3 and FT4 levels than controls.

51680a6d298dcd4e51000063	What is the function of cryptochrome-1 in mouse?	Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland. The Cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel-running behavior and lack of rhythmic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double-mutant mice in constant darkness. Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (mPer1 and mPer2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (mCry1 and mCry2) genes. A mutation in the mPer2 gene leads to a gradual loss of circadian rhythmicity in mice kept in constant darkness (DD). Here we show that inactivation of the mCry2 gene in mPer2 mutant mice restores circadian rhythmicity and normal clock gene expression patterns. Thus, mCry2 can act as a nonallelic suppressor of mPer2, which points to direct or indirect interactions of PER2 and CRY2 proteins. In marked contrast, inactivation of mCry1 in mPer2 mutant mice does not restore circadian rhythmicity but instead results in complete behavioral arrhythmicity in DD, indicating different effects of mCry1 and mCry2 in the clock mechanism Cryptochrome 1 and 2 gene products act in the negative feedback loop and are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel running behaviour and absence of cyclic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mice in constant darkness. , when mCry-deficient mice are housed in normal light-dark cycles, a single non-circadian peak in neuronal activity can be detected in SCN slices prepared two hours after the beginning of the day. This light-induced increase in electric activity of the SCN suggests that deletion of the mCry genes converts the core oscillator in an hour-glass-like timekeeper and may explain why in normal day-night cycles mCry-deficient mice show apparently normal behaviour. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 act as essential components of the central and peripheral circadian clocks for generation of circadian rhythms in mammals cryptochrome-1 mRNA was found in DA cells, immunocytochemistry was extended to other components of the circadian clock machinery. This analysis showed that DA cells contain the most common clock-related proteins. Cryptochrome 1 and cryptochrome 2 proteins are core components of the mammalian circadian clock and mice mutated in both genes are arrhythmic. a domain in the extreme C terminus of BMAL1 that plays an essential role in the rhythmic control of E-box-mediated circadian transcription. Remarkably, the last 43 aa of BMAL1 are required for transcriptional activation, as well as for association with the circadian transcriptional repressor CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), depending on the coexistence of CLOCK protein. circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). CRY1 is a master regulator of circadian rhythm that regulates the extracellular calcification of MSCs. Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs. Cytoplasmic hnRNP D levels displayed a pattern that was reciprocal to the mcry1 oscillation. Knockdown of hnRNP D stabilized mcry1 mRNA and resulted in enhancement of the oscillation amplitude and a slight delay of the phase. Our results suggest that hnRNP D plays a role as a fine regulator contributing to the mcry1 mRNA turnover rate and the modulation of circadian rhythm. more than three mutations of conserved PER2 residues impaired not only binding to CRY1 but also subsequent nuclear translocation, although mutations of non-conserved residues did not affect interaction with CRY1. Thus, the conserved amino acid residues of 1179-1198 in PER2 are apparently responsible for binding to CRY1. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) are considered essential for generating circadian rhythms in mammals. The role of Cry1 and Cry2 in circadian rhythm expression and acute light-induced suppression of pineal melatonin was assessed using Cry1 and Cry2 double-deficient mice (Cry1(-/-) /Cry2(-/-) ) developed from the C3H strain that synthesizes melatonin. Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), an essential clock component, displays evening-time expression and serves as a strong repressor at morning-time elements (E box/E' box). A genetic complementation assay in Cry1(-/-):Cry2(-/-) cells revealed that substantial delay of Cry1 expression is required to restore circadian rhythmicity, and its prolonged delay slows circadian oscillation. Taken together, our data suggest that phase delay in Cry1 transcription is required for mammalian clock function. the 24-h mRNA rhythms of the following genes were suppressed in db/db mice compared with control mice: the clock genes period homolog 1/2 (Per1/2) and cryptochrome 1/2 (Cry1/2) and their target genes D site albumin promoter-binding protein (Dbp) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparg) in the aorta and mesenteric arteries; Dbp in the heart; Per1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Rev-erba), and Dbp in the kidney; and Per1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In mammals, circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are controlled by a central pacemaker, the SCN, and subordinated clocks throughout the body. On the molecular level, these clocks are based on transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of clock genes that regulate their own transcription. Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (Per1 and Per2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) genes. I The mammalian clock protein, cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), is degraded via the FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination pathway, suggesting that it is also likely to be targeted by the deubiquitination pathway. Here, we identified that USP2a, a circadian-controlled deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with CRY1 and enhances its protein stability via deubiquitination upon serum shock. Depletion of Usp2a by shRNA greatly enhances the ubiquitination of CRY1 and dampens the oscillation amplitude of the CRY1 protein during a circadian cycle. By stabilizing the CRY1 protein, USP2a represses the Per2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous Per2 gene expression. We also demonstrated that USP2a-dependent deubiquitination and stabilization of the CRY1 protein occur in the mouse liver. The mammalian circadian clock is composed of interlocking feedback loops. Cryptochrome is a central component in the core negative feedback loop, whereas Rev-Erbα, a member of the nuclear receptor family, is an essential component of the interlocking loop. By analyzing the Fbxl3 and Cryptochrome 1 double-mutant mice, we found that FBXL3 also regulates the amplitudes of E-box-driven gene expression. These two separate roles of FBXL3 in circadian feedback loops provide a mechanism that contributes to the period determination and robustness of the clock.

5319ac36b166e2b806000031	Which G protein is essential in the formation and function of lamellipodia?	We specifically identified that the Spa homology domain (aa 250-420) of GIT1 is required for GIT1-cortactin complex localization to the leading edge. The mechanisms involved extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2-mediated Cortactin-S405 phosphorylation and activation of Rac1/Cdc42. We demonstrated the utility of this system with LAD constructs that can recruit the small G-protein Rac1 to the plasma membrane and induce the local formation of lamellipodia in response to focal illumination. We found that fibroblasts from EDG-1 null embryos did not migrate toward PDGF or SPP, and inhibition of motility correlated with defective activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is required for lamellipodia formation and directional locomotion Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement. Evidence from these models indicates that migration is a highly complex process, which is likely to involve the tightly controlled spatial and temporal interaction of multiple factors: (v) molecules which regulate cytoskeletal function (e.g. Rac), which allows the formation of specialized cellular processes termed lamellipodia.

Our results show a high prevalence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man RA in LAC women is not only more common but presents with some clinical characteristics that differ from RA presentation in men.

550c4011a103b78016000009	Which residue of alpha-synuclein was found to be phosphorylated in Lewy bodies?	Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (S129) is highly elevated in Parkinson's disease patients where it mainly accumulates in the Lewy bodies Approximately 90% of α-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% or less of total α-syn is phosphorylated at this residue in the normal brain. This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies. These inclusion bodies are the characteristic pathologic lesions of Parkinson disease Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies. �-Synuclein is causative for autosomal dominant familial Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the phosphorylation of �-synuclein at residue Ser-129 is a key posttranslational modification detected in Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies lesions. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions. alpha-Synuclein is a major protein component deposited in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites that is extensively phosphorylated at Ser(129), although its role in neuronal degeneration is still elusive. These observations are most consistent with a model in which preferential accumulation of normally produced Ser-129 phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is the key event responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies in various Lewy body diseases. The predominant modification of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies is a single phosphorylation at Ser-129. Approximately 90% of Î±-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated Î±-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by mass spectrometry analysis and studies with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser 129 of alpha-synuclein, that this residue is selectively and extensively phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions Alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129) in intracellular protein aggregates called Lewy bodies	['Serine 129']
58ce9bf1d46b5c2951000002	Which disease is associated with mutated Sox2?	Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M) are developmental ocular malformations defined as the complete absence or reduction in size of the eye. A/M is a highly heterogeneous disorder with SOX2 and FOXE3 playing major roles in dominant and recessive pedigrees, respectively; anophthalmia/microphthalmia (AM) or anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) have an estimated combined prevalence of 3.7 in 10,000 births. Mutations in SOX2 are the most frequent contributors to severe ODA, yet account for a minority of the genetic drivers. Three causative SOX2 mutations were found in subjects with syndromic A. SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome is an uncommon autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the SOX2 gene and clinically characterized by severe eye malformations (anophthalmia/microphthalmia) and extraocular anomalies mainly involving brain, esophagus, and genitalia.

56f4011709dd18d46b000003	What is the main symptom of Marfan syndrome patients?	The diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome remain controversial. It is of utmost importance to identify patients at risk for acute aortic events to establish the correct surgical timing and the appropriate surgical treatment The not-uncommon spinal abnormalities associated with Marfan's syndrome rarely undergird clinical problems, and neurological features accompanying such bone abnormalities are rare. The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation.  For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of "arachnodactyly". Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder caused mainly by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes.  The characteristics of acute aortic dissection among young Chinese patients: a comparison between Marfan syndrome and non-Marfan syndrome patients. The main objective of this trial is to assess whether losartan treatment leads to a clinically relevant decrease of aortic dilatation in adult patients with Marfan syndrome. During a 16-year period, 300 patients with presumed Marfan syndrome underwent 398 operations on the aorta and branch arteries, including 125 aortic root operations, 59 aortic arch repairs, 31 descending thoracic aortic repairs, and 178 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs.

571f5c150fd6f91b68000009	Which protein is found to be mutated in Friedreich's ataxia?	It is generally accepted that Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a deficiency in frataxin expression, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, which mainly affects the brain, dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, heart and in certain cases the pancreas Friedreich's ataxia is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased expression of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein that stimulates iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis In eukaryotes, frataxin deficiency (FXN) causes severe phenotypes including loss of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster protein activity, accumulation of mitochondrial iron and leads to the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia Complete absence of frataxin, the mitochondrial protein defective in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, is lethal in C. elegans, while its partial deficiency extends animal lifespan in a p53 dependent manner. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Friedreich's ataxia results from a deficiency in the mitochondrial protein frataxin, which carries single point mutations in some patients. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cardio- and neurodegenerative disease, is caused by low expression of frataxin, a small mitochondrial protein, encoded in the nucleus. The severe reduction in mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, encoded by the X25 gene, causes Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive hereditary ataxia. Assembly and iron-binding properties of human frataxin, the protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia is a human neurodegenerative and myocardial disease caused by decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, is caused by abnormally low levels of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease caused by a deficiency of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein of unknown function. This review will focus on the progress of potential treatment strategies for Friedreich ataxia that target the GAA expanded gene and seek to increase the level of frataxin message and protein. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and which is associated with abnormal intramitochondrial iron handling The neurodegenerative disorder FRDA (Friedreich&apos;s ataxia) results from a deficiency in frataxin, a putative iron chaperone, and is due to the presence of a high number of GAA repeats in the coding regions of both alleles of the frataxin gene, which impair protein expression The Friedreich's ataxia protein frataxin modulates DNA base excision repair in prokaryotes and mammals. It is caused by deficiency of frataxin, a highly conserved nuclear-encoded protein localized in mitochondria. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Interestingly, Drosophila frataxin (dfh), which causes Friedreich's ataxia if mutated in humans, displayed an interacting effect with Al, suggesting Friedreich's ataxia patients might be more susceptible to Al toxicity. Although the Friedreich's ataxia phenotype results from decreased expression of a mitochondrially targeted protein, frataxin, mitochondrial myopathy has not been described as a feature of the disease.

5324ce779b2d7acc7e00001e	Which drug is considered as the first line treatment of fibromyalgia?	Multimodal approaches seem to be the treatment of choice in fibromyalgia A multidisciplinary program was developed and implemented for patients with fibromyalgia in the primary care setting. The program included education (seven sessions) and physical therapy (25 sessions). Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines.  Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, but only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Valproic acid and its sodium salt (sodium valproate) are antiepileptic drugs that are sometimes used to treat chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, although they are not licensed for this use.  Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pregabalin is, therefore, a valuable option in the first-line treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.	['Pregabalin']
55241f9e2c8b63434a000004	What kind of enzyme is encoded by the proto-oncogene ABL1?	The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, transduces diverse extracellular signals to protein networks that control proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. ABL1 was first identified as an oncogene required for the development of leukaemias initiated by retroviruses or chromosome translocations.  Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. ABL-family proteins comprise one of the best conserved branches of the tyrosine kinases. Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3-Src homology 2-tyrosine kinase) domain cassette, which confers autoregulated kinase activity and is common among nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. This cassette is coupled to an actin-binding and -bundling domain, which makes ABL proteins capable of connecting phosphoregulation with actin-filament reorganization. Two vertebrate paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, have evolved to perform specialized functions.  Protein tyrosine kinases form a large family of signaling proteins implicated in both normal and malignant cell signaling. The aim of this study was to identify protein tyro-sine kinases that can transform hematopoietic cells to growth factor independent proliferation when constitutively activated by homodimerization. We used a modified retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen with a retroviral vector containing the homodimerization domain of ETV6 followed by an artificial splice donor site. Integration of this retroviral vector within a gene of the host genome would generate a fusion transcript containing the dimerization domain and part of the disrupted gene. Using this strategy with the IL3 dependent Ba/F3 cell line, we identified 8 different protein tyrosine kinases (Abl1, Fgfr1, Hck, Jak2, Lck, Mertk, Mst1r, Tnk1) that transformed the cells. Three families of tyrosine kinases have long been recognized to play critical roles in TCR-dependent signaling. They are the Src, zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa, and Tec families of kinases. More recently, the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinases have been shown to be activated by TCR engagement and to be required for maximal TCR signaling. Using T-cell conditional knockout mice deficient for Abl family kinases, Abl (Abl1) and Abl-related gene (Arg) (Abl2), it was recently shown that loss of Abl kinases results in defective T-cell development and a partial block in the transition to the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage.  ABL family tyrosine kinases are tightly regulated by autoinhibition and phosphorylation mechanisms. These kinases maintain an inactive conformation through intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 domains. RIN1, a downstream effector of RAS, binds to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains and stimulates ABL tyrosine kinase activity. RIN1 binding to the ABL2 kinase resulted in a large decrease in Km and a small increase in Vmax toward an ABL consensus substrate peptide. RIN1 increased the kinase activity of both ABL1 and ABL2, and this occurred in the presence or absence of ABL regulatory domains outside the SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase domain core. Constitutively activated mutants of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral (v-abl) homolog (1) protein) and JAK2 (JAnus Kinase 2 or Just Another Kinase 2) play a central role in the pathogenesis of clinically and morphologically distinct chronic myeloproliferative disorders but are also found in some cases of de novo acute leukemia and lymphoma. Abl1 (previously known as Abl) and the Abl1-related gene product Abl2 (previously known as Arg) define a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate actin structure and presynaptic axon guidance. Here we show that the Abl kinases are critical mediators of postsynaptic assembly downstream of agrin and MuSK.  The ABL1 proto-oncogene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion and stress response. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results.

5150b807d24251bc05000072	How many clinical trials for off-label drugs in neonates are cited in the literature.	Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis.	['none', '0', 'zero']

TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) In this review we will discuss the role of the X chromosome encoded toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the development of autoimmunity. X-Chromosome complement and estrogen receptor signaling independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α production of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from women. Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α response of pDCs in women. The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7.  Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. By genome scanning, evidence of linkage between chromosome Xp22 and asthma and related atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8 genes. Since the TLR7 gene is localized on the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was analyzed separately in males and females.  TLR7 (located on the X chromosome) Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well as the incidence of lupus nephritis. Although the translocated X chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. TLR7 escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. Recently, the Yaa mutation was identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. Here, we report that B cells containing the Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus are intrinsically biased toward nucleolar antigens because of increased expression of TLR7, a single-stranded RNA-binding innate immune receptor. The TLR7 gene is duplicated in Yaa mice because of a 4-Megabase expansion of the pseudoautosomal region.	['chromosomeX']
514c3fd7d24251bc05000062	Intact macromolecular assemblies are analysed by advanced mass spectrometry. How large complexes (in molecular weight) have been studied?	Here we show that the Orbitrap mass analyzer can be used to measure protein assemblies of molecular weights approaching one megadalton with sensitivity down to the detection of single ions. Using this relationship we show that we can determine masses of both 30S subunits and intact 2.3 MDa 70S ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus. We confirm the existence of these subpopulations using tandem mass spectrometry of intact 30S subunits. Overall, the results show that, rather than uniform particles, gas-phase ribosomes consist of a number of discrete populations. More generally, the results establish a rigorous procedure for accurate mass measurement and spectral analysis of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies.	['2.3 megadalton']

5d387f24a1e1595105000013	How long in bp is the human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2)?	The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes.  The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome.  The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution  The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome.  This map extends 2.3 Mbp from the telomere to sex-chromosome-specific DNA, includes at least seven CpG islands and locates four genetically mapped loci. 	['320kbp']
530cefaaad0bf1360c000012	Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?	We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.  Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0.05). Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients.  Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized.  Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%).  Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient.  Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron.  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain.  All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases.  Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease. Restless leg syndrome manifested by iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis. Diurnal effects on motor control are evident in the human disease of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), which is purported to be linked to brain iron deficiency as well as alterations in dopaminergic systems.  Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome.  Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy.  Clinical, EEG, electromyographic and polysomnographic studies in restless legs syndrome caused by magnesium deficiency. A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.	['iron']

5a6f960fb750ff445500005c	Centor criteria are used for which disease?	Methods: MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. METHODS: Trained pharmacy staff assessed patients presenting with a sore throat using the Centor scoring system and patients meeting three or all four of the criteria were offered a throat swab test for Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococci.  CONCLUSION: Clinician judgement and Centor score are inadequate tools for clinical decision-making for children presenting with sore throat.  A Study to Determine if Addition of Palatal Petechiae to Centor Criteria Adds More Significance to Clinical Diagnosis of Acute Strep Pharyngitis in Children. Objective. A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children. Hypothesis. In children, Centor Criteria does not cover all the symptoms and signs of acute strep pharyngitis. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children.  Conclusion. Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. Appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria. Objective To ascertain the appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among Thai community pharmacists according to the Centor criteria and to identify factors related to antibiotic dispensing. Main outcome measure The appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis according to the original and modified Centor criteria and determinants of antibiotic dispensing including demographic characteristics of pharmacists, knowledge on pharyngitis, and attitudes and control beliefs on antibiotic dispensing.  Conclusion Pharmacists who are knowledgeable on the Centor criteria are more likely to appropriately diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis and less likely to dispense antibiotics in such case. Adult men and women, youth and children ≥6 years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study.  Previous studies have shown that the Centor score combined with Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) for Group A Streptococci can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients with sore throat.  Spectrum bias was present, inasmuch as RADT sensitivity increased with Centor scores, ie, 47% sensitivity among children with 0 Centor criteria, 65% among those with 1 criterion, 82% among those with 2 criteria, and 90% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The sensitivity of RADT for GABHS pharyngitis is not a fixed value but varies with the severity of disease. The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria. However, even among pediatric patients with > or =3 Centor criteria for GABHS pharyngitis, the sensitivity of RADT is still too low to support the use of RADT without culture confirmation of negative results.<br> A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children. if Addition of Palatal Petechiae to Centor Criteria Adds More Significance to Clinical Diagnosis of Acute Strep Pharyngitis in Children. Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. INTRODUCTION Centor criteria (fever >38.5°C, swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate and absence of cough) are an algorithm to assess the probability of group A β haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) as the origin of sore throat, developed for adults. appropriateness of diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis among thai community pharmacists according to the centor criteria Diagnosing GABHS (Group A-beta Hemolytic Streptococcus) tonsillopharyngitis by clinical scoring is a recommended approach in developed countries, but there is still much controversy for low resource settings.We aimed to assess the impact of Centor criteria with the support of practical laboratory tests.We prospectively included patients complaining sore throat (N = 282). We evaluated them in terms of Centor scoring and performed white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), rapid antigen detecting test, and throat culture.In GABHS cases (N = 32, 11·3%), two of the criteria were observed to be positive in more than half of the cases (N = 19, 59·3%), while 13 (40·7%) cases met three/four criteria. The specificity of having two criteria was found to be 65·5% and increased to 91·5% after including CRP and WBC.Centor criteria could be safely used to reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage for tonsillopharyngitis in developing countries. Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) is often performed for diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis among children. Among adults, the sensitivity of this test varies on the basis of disease severity (spectrum bias). A similar phenomenon may occur when this test is used in a pediatric population, which may affect the need for culture confirmation of all negative RADT results.To assess the performance of a clinical scoring system and to determine whether RADT spectrum bias is present among children who are evaluated for GABHS pharyngitis.Laboratory and clinical records for a consecutive series of pediatric patients who underwent RADT at the Marshfield Clinic between January 2002 and March 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified according to the number of clinical features present by using modified Centor criteria, ie, history of fever, absence of cough, presence of pharyngeal exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of the RADT was defined as the number of patients with positive RADT results divided by the number of patients with either positive RADT results or negative RADT results but positive throat culture results.RADT results were positive for 117 of 561 children (21%), and culture results were positive for 35 of 444 children (8%) with negative RADT results. The overall prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 27% (95% confidence interval: 23-31%). The prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis was 18% among patients with 0 Centor criteria, 16% among those with 1 criterion, 32% among those with 2 criteria, and 50% among those with 3 or 4 criteria. Spectrum bias was present, inasmuch as RADT sensitivity increased with Centor scores, ie, 47% sensitivity among children with 0 Centor criteria, 65% among those with 1 criterion, 82% among those with 2 criteria, and 90% among those with 3 or 4 criteria.The sensitivity of RADT for GABHS pharyngitis is not a fixed value but varies with the severity of disease. However, even among pediatric patients with > or =3 Centor criteria for GABHS pharyngitis, the sensitivity of RADT is still too low to support the use of RADT without culture confirmation of negative results. Centor criteria (fever >38.5°C, swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate and absence of cough) are an algorithm to assess the probability of group A β haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) as the origin of sore throat, developed for adults. We wanted to evaluate the correlation between Centor criteria and presence of GABHS in children with sore throat admitted to our paediatric emergency department (PED).Retrospective cohort study.The emergency department of a large tertiary university hospital in Brussels, with over 20 000 yearly visits for children below age 16.All medical records (from 2008 to 2010) of children between ages 2 and 16, who were diagnosed with pharyngitis, tonsillitis or sore throat and having a throat swab culture for GABHS. Children with underlying chronic respiratory, cardiac, haematological or immunological diseases and children who had already received antibiotics (AB) prior to the PED consult were excluded. Only records with a full disease history were selected. Out of a total 2118 visits for sore throats, 441 met our criteria. The children were divided into two age groups, 2-5 and 5-16 years.The prevalence of GABHS was higher in the older children compared to the preschoolers (38.7 vs 27.6; p=0.01), and the overall prevalence was 32%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of GABHS for all different Centor scores within an age group. Likelihood ratios (LR) demonstrate that none of the individual symptoms or a Centor score of ≥3 seems to be effective in ruling in or ruling out GABHS. Pooled LR (CI) for Centor ≥3 was 0.67 (CI 0.50 to 0.90) for the preschoolers and 1.37 (CI 1.04 to 1.79) for the older children.Our results confirm the ineffectiveness of Centor criteria as a predicting factor for finding GABHS in a throat swab culture in children. The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length. A study to determine if addition of palatal petechiae to Centor criteria adds more value for clinical diagnosis of acute strep pharyngitis in children.In children, Centor Criteria does not cover all the symptoms and signs of acute strep pharyngitis. We hypothesize that addition of palatal petechiae to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children.One hundred patients with a complaint of sore throat were enrolled in the study. All the patients were examined clinically using the Centor Criteria. They were also examined for other signs and symptoms like petechial lesions over the palate, abdominal pain, and skin rash. All the patients were given rapid strep tests, and throat cultures were sent. No antibiotics were given until culture results were obtained.The sample size was 100 patients. All 100 had fever, sore throat, and erythema of tonsils. Twenty of the 100 patients had tonsillar exudates, 85/100 had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes, and 86/100 had no cough. In total, 9 out of the 100 patients had positive throat cultures. We observed that petechiae over the palate, a very significant sign, is not included in the Centor Criteria. Palatal petechiae were present in 8 out of the 100 patients. Six out of these 8 with palatal petechiae had positive throat culture for strep (75%). Only 7 out of 20 with exudates had positive strep culture. Sixteen out of the 100 patients had rapid strep test positive. Those 84/100 who had negative rapid strep also had negative throat culture.We used Fisher's exact test, comparing throat culture positive and negative versus presence of exudates and palatal hemorrhages with positive and negative throat cultures and the resultant P value <.0001.Our study concludes that addition of petechiae over the palate to Centor Criteria will increase the possibility of diagnosing acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children. we evaluate the test characteristics and test for spectrum bias of a rapid antigen test for group a beta hemolytic streptococcal gabhs pharyngitis among adults medical record and laboratory results of consecutive adult patients receiving a rapid antigen test for gabhs in the emergency department or urgent care clinic of an

compliance with correct antibiotic course length was 15 antibiotic choice and dose was correct in 94 and 92 of cases respectively antibiotic frequency was correctly prescribed in 100 of patients we introduced interventions that included oral and poster presentations to multidisciplinary team dissemination of guidelines through internal e mail and systemic changes to gp electronic patient record system emis this involved creating an automated sore throat template and information page on re auditing of 71 patients after two pdsa cycles compliance with nice criteria was 87 with a significant reduction in immediate prescribing 66 centor criteria documentation was 42 correct antibiotic course length was prescribed in over 30 of cases other antibiotic regimen parameters choice dose and frequency were correct in 100 of cases the initial results demonstrated that significant changes were needed in particular reducing the amount of antibiotics prescribed by increasing compliance with nice criteria and ensuring all parameters of antibiotic prescription were correct we showed that significant sustainable improvement is achievable through carefully devised automated systemic changes that provides critical information in readily accessible format and does not solely rely on prescribers knowledge and initiative the outcome of these interventions are a decrease in immediate antibiotic prescription significant increase in centor criteria documentation and an increase in compliance with the correct course length of antibiotics all these measures would contribute to reduction in antimicrobial resistance and improvement in patient care in the community future work must focus on improving compliance with correct antibiotic course length.

58bac71222d3005309000013	Which histone mutation is associated with gliomas?	Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3 We show that H3.3K27M expression synergizes with p53 loss and PDGFRA activation in neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, resulting in neoplastic transformation. Some of these molecular changes with clinicopathological utility have been used for the first time in the most recent edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumours to define entities like ependymoma, RELA fusion-positive or diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant. The recent discovery of somatic oncogenic mutations affecting chromatin regulation in pediatric high-grade glioma has markedly improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and these findings have stimulated the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetic regulators for disease treatment. Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. In this series, histone H3-K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation and EGFR amplification, rarely co-occurred with BRAF-V600E mutation, and was commonly associated with p53 overexpression, ATRX loss (except in pontine gliomas), and monosomy 10. Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Diffuse Midline Gliomas with Histone H3-K27M Mutation: A Series of 47 Cases Assessing the Spectrum of Morphologic Variation and Associated Genetic Alterations. Here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3-K27M mutation. Histone H3 lysine(27)-to-methionine (H3K27M) gain-of-function mutations occur in highly aggressive pediatric gliomas. Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1 (HIST3H1B). Pediatric brainstem gliomas often harbor oncogenic K27M mutation of histone H3.3 We report that human diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) containing the K27M mutation display significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo In particular, histone genes (H3F3A (K27M) , HIST1H3B (K27M) ) mutations are frequent in adult DIBG whereas IDH1 (R132H) mutations are rare. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. The role of the H3.3K27M mutation in tumorigenesis is not fully understood.  The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression. In this series, histone H3-K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation and EGFR amplification, rarely co-occurred with BRAF-V600E mutation, and was commonly associated with p53 overexpression, ATRX loss (except in pontine gliomas), and monosomy 10. <CopyrightInformation>© 2015 International Society of Neuropathology.</C We established a Drosophila animal model for the pathogenic histone H3K27M mutation and show that its overexpression resembles polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) loss-of-function phenotypes, causing derepression of PRC2 target genes and developmental perturbations. Here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3-K27M mutation. We report that human diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) containing the K27M mutation display significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, thalamic gliomas with wild-type H3F3A had DNA methylation profiles similar to those of hemispheric glioblastomas.CONCLUSION: We found that high-grade thalamic gliomas from young adults, like those from children and adolescents, frequently had H3F3A K27M. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. Although the K27M mutation was frequently observed in adult brainstem and thalamic gliomas, this mutation tended to be associated with a poorer prognosis in brainstem gliomas but not in thalamic gliomas. Diffuse Midline Gliomas with Histone H3-K27M Mutation: A Series of 47 Cases Assessing the Spectrum of Morphologic Variation and Associated Genetic Alterations. In this series, histone H3-K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation and EGFR amplification, rarely co-occurred with BRAF-V600E mutation, and was commonly associated with p53 overexpression, ATRX loss (except in pontine gliomas), and monosomy 10. The H3.3 K27M mutation results in a poorer prognosis in brainstem gliomas than thalamic gliomas in adults. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Interestingly, the G34 mutations, the K36M mutations, and the majority of K27M mutations occur in genes encoding the replacement histone H3.3.	['K27M in H3.3']
56df03c751531f7e3300000a	Which properties of the mRNA does N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affect?	N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naïve pluripotency-promoting transcripts.  Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification Monitoring m6A levels upon WTAP depletion allowed the definition of accurate and near single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and their classification into WTAP-dependent and -independent sites. WTAP-dependent sites are located at internal positions in transcripts, topologically static across a variety of systems we surveyed, and inversely correlated with mRNA stability, consistent with a role in establishing "basal" degradation rates. Methylations of adenosine residues (m6A) in pre-mRNA are important for formation of late simian virus 40 mRNAs The data argues for a role of internal m6A moieties in modulating the processing-linked transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of nontransformed cells.  N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) residues, which are found internally in viral and cellular mRNA populations at the sequences Apm6ApC and Gpm6ApC, have been proposed to play a role in mRNA processing and transport. The role of Fat Mass and Obesity-associated protein (FTO) and its substrate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA processing and adipogenesis remains largely unknown. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common modification of mRNA with potential roles in fine-tuning the RNA life cycle. The results of that study and of experiments using inhibitors of methylation suggest that m6A might be involved in mRNA processing events.  Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known.   The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors, MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit (MT-A70). The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme. Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known.	['mRNA stability']
552fac4fbc4f83e828000006	Which fusion protein is involved in the development of Ewing sarcoma?	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. It is driven by oncogenic fusion proteins (i.e. EWS/FLI1) acting as aberrant transcription factors that upregulate and downregulate target genes, leading to cellular transformation EWS/FLI-1 oncoprotein subtypes impose different requirements for transformation and metastatic activity in a murine model Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (EWS/PNET) are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations most often generating a chimeric EWS/FLI-1 gene The resulting EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein is believed to behave as an aberrant transcriptional activator that contributes to ESFT development by altering the expression of its target genes in a permissive cellular environment Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor The orphan nuclear receptor DAX1 is up-regulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and is highly expressed in Ewing tumors The Ewing family of tumors harbors chromosomal translocations that join the N-terminal region of the EWS gene with the C-terminal region of several transcription factors of the ETS family, mainly FLI1, resulting in chimeric transcription factors that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Ewing tumors. To identify downstream targets of the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, we established 293 cells expressing constitutively either the chimeric EWS/FLI1 or wild type FLI1 proteins and used cDNA arrays to identify genes differentially regulated by EWS/FLI1 The high levels of DAX1 found in Ewing tumors and its potent transcriptional repressor activity suggest that the oncogenic effect of EWS/FLI1 may be mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulation of DAX1 expression Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are highly aggressive and highly metastatic tumors caused by a chromosomal fusion between the Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS) with the transcription factor FLI-1. EWS-FLI1 is a fusion protein that results from the pathognomonic translocation of Ewing sarcoma (ES). Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma. Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Blocking the road, stopping the engine or killing the driver? Advances in targeting EWS/FLI-1 fusion in Ewing sarcoma as novel therapy. Fusion of the EWS gene to FLI1 produces a fusion oncoprotein that drives an aberrant gene expression program responsible for the development of Ewing sarcoma. Mosaic expression of the human EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in zebrafish caused the development of tumors with histology strongly resembling that of human Ewings sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of aggressive pediatric malignancies driven by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor up-regulating specific target genes, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 and Y5 receptors (Y5Rs). Ewing sarcoma is primarily caused by a t(11;22) chromosomal translocation encoding the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. Herein, we show that the DNA repair protein and transcriptional cofactor, EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. The EWS-ETS fusion is causative in the development of Ewing's tumour. The resulting EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein is believed to behave as an aberrant transcriptional activator that contributes to ESFT development by altering the expression of its target genes in a permissive cellular environment. EWS-FLI1 is an oncogenic fusion protein implicated in the development of Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) Eighty-five percent of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma Together, our data reveal that EWSAT1 is a downstream target of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes Thus, we developed a highly validated transcriptional profile for the EWS/FLI fusion protein and identified a critical target gene in Ewing's sarcoma development. Our understanding of Ewing's sarcoma development mediated by the EWS/FLI fusion protein has been limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the tumor cell of origin Ewing's sarcomas are characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations expressing EWS-ETS fusion proteins, the most common of which is EWS-FLI.(1-5) EWS-FLI is an oncogenic transcription factor that regulates genes involved in tumorigenesis.(6,7) Because the Ewing's sarcoma cell of origin remains unknown, a variety of model systems have been developed to study EWS-FLI fusions,(8-14) and multiple microarray experiments describing potential EWS-FLI target genes have been reported.(8,10,11,13,15-21) Each model has potential benefits and drawbacks, but a large-scale comparison of these has not been reported Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein	['EWS/FLI1']
5e2deb35fbd6abf43b00001c	Which method has been developed for mapping of Transcription Start Sites (TSS) starting from nanograms of RNA?	SLIC-CAGE: high-resolution transcription start site mapping using nanogram-levels of total RNA. Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a methodology for genome-wide quantitative mapping of mRNA 5' ends to precisely capture transcription start sites at a single nucleotide resolution. In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 µg), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells.

58da111c8acda34529000010	Which is the main cause of the Patau syndrome?	Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by a triad of cleft lip and palate, postaxial polydactyly and microcephaly. Mosaic trisomy 13 is very rare, it occurs in only 5% of all patients with trisomy 13 phenotype. Among full autosomal trisomies, only trisomies of chromosome 21 (Down syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 13 (Patau syndrome) are compatible with postnatal survival.  We describe the management of the eyelid anomaly associated with Patau syndrome. Trisomy 13 is the genotype of the syndrome's phenotype.  This article identifies the causes and manifestations of most of these trisomies: trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).  WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13. Patau syndrome is a chromosomal disorder associated with multiple malformations caused by inheritance of an extra chromosome (trisomy 13). Survival of trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) in England and Wales: 2004-2011 To determine whether older paternal age increases the risk of fathering a pregnancy with Patau (trisomy 13), Edwards (trisomy 18), Klinefelter (XXY) or XYY syndrome.Case-control: cases with each of these syndromes were matched to four controls with Down syndrome from within the same congenital anomaly register and with maternal age within 6 months.Data from 22 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registers in 12 European countries.Diagnoses with observed or (for terminations) predicted year of birth from 1980 to 2005, comprising live births, fetal deaths with gestational age ≥ 20 weeks and terminations after prenatal diagnosis of the anomaly. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in 5-10% associated with chromosomal abnormalities like, Pallister Killian syndrome, Trisomy 18, and certain deletions.. Association of CDH with trisomy 13 (Patau syndromes) is very rare WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13.  Patau syndrome is a chromosomal disorder associated with multiple malformations caused by inheritance of an extra chromosome (trisomy 13).  Ocular abnormalities in Patau syndrome (chromosome 13 trisomy syndrome). Trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome): a rare case of survival into adulthood. BACKGROUND: Whilst maternal age is an established risk factor for Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the aetiology and contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13. Patau syndrome, trisomy 13, is the third commonest autosomal trisomy. Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) is very rare in live-born babies.	['Trisome 13']

5319a708b166e2b806000024	Which is the target of bortezomib used in cancer therapy?	The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades 80 - 90% of intracellular proteins. Cancer cells take advantage of the UPS for their increased growth and decreased apoptotic cell death. Thus, the components that make up the UPS represent a diverse group of potential anti-cancer targets. The success of the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib not only proved that the proteasome is a feasible and valuable anti-cancer target, but also inspired researchers to extensively explore other potential targets of this pathway. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been identified as a potential molecular target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) characterized by complete refractoriness to multimodal therapeutic approaches. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates many basic cellular processes and has been proven to be a promising target for cancer therapy. Bortezomib is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma. This review summarizes the current status of bortezomib as well as several other proteasome inhibitors that are currently under clinical and preclinical investigation. Ubiquitin-tagged substrates are degraded by the 26S proteasome, which is a multisubunit complex comprising a proteolytic 20S core particle capped by 19S regulatory particles. The approval of bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma validated the 20S core particle as an anticancer drug target. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a conserved pathway regulating numerous biological processes including protein turnover, DNA repair, and intracellular trafficking. The development of bortezomib (Velcade(®)) as a treatment for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma has verified this and suggests that targeting other components of the UPS may be a viable strategy for the treatment for cancer. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is now in the clinic to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome-wide effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on estrogen-regulated transcription in MCF7 human breast cancer cells and showed that bortezomib caused a specific global decrease in estrogen-induced gene expression. The clinical efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib toward multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies provides the "proof of concept" that targeting the proteasome is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. It has previously been suggested that the excess proteins not targeted to the proteasome, or that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited through the use of chemically active agents such as bortezomib, are linked to impaired cell survival, and that their packaging in the form of an aggresome somehow minimizes their 'proteotoxicity' allowing these toxic proteins to be sequestered away from normal cellular machinery. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has clinical activity in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a potent and specific reversible proteasome inhibitor, which has shown strong in vitro antitumor activity as single agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs in a broad spectrum of hematological and solid malignancies. In addition to the development and clinical validation of proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in myeloma therapy, recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to develop inhibitors for specific ubiquitination and deubiquitination enzymes. Bortezomib as first-in-class proteasome inhibitor has proven to be highly effective in some hematological malignancies, overcomes conventional chemoresistance, directly induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and also targets the tumor microenvironment. It has been granted approval by the FDA for relapsed multiple myeloma, and recently for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy has come in the form of approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this agent has become a standard of care. Cells were cultured, exposed to proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, ALLN, MG-132 and epoxomicin) and then assayed for cell cycle and cell death analyses. The proteasome has emerged as an important target for cancer therapy with the approval of bortezomib, a first-in-class, reversible proteasome inhibitor, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical use, and received approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, therefore validating inhibition of the proteasome as an anticancer target. Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) was the first proteasome inhibitor to receive regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Preclinical evidence using bortezomib, the only proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical trials, suggests that proteasome inhibition may be effective in the treatment of hematologic and solid malignancies by promoting apoptosis, retarding angiogenesis, and inhibiting tumor cell adhesion and production of growth factors by acting on molecules such as nuclear factor-kappaB. Bortezomib was recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is currently being investigated, both as a single agent and in combination, in phase I and II trials in a variety of tumor types. Protein degradation pathways are also targets for cancer therapy, as shown by the successful introduction of bortezomib, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor that has entered clinical trials. In multiple myeloma, both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Evaluation Agency granted approval for the use of bortezomib (Velcade) for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. The potent and selective proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (VELCADE; formerly known as PS-341) is particularly promising as a potential anticancer agent. Inhibitors of the proteasome impact on cells in part through down-regulation of nuclear factor kappaB, but also through modulation of cell cycle proteins and other pro- and antiapoptotic pathways. Bortezomib (VELCADE; formerly PS-341), the first such inhibitor to undergo clinical testing, has demonstrated impressive antitumor activity and manageable toxicities in Phase I and II trials both as a single agent, and in combination with other drugs. Although targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases is still in its infancy, speedy approval of the general proteasome inhibitor, Velcade (bortezomib) by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma suggests the promise of specific E3 inhibitors in anti-cancer therapy.

5a68f965b750ff445500001a	Clue cells are characteristics to which causative bacteria of vaginitis?	Most of these 290 smears contained clue cells (indicating Gardnerella infection) and a lack of lactobacilli.  As part of the routine screening process, all smears were screened for the overgrowth of Gardnerella (i.e. smears with an abundance of clue cells) and for the presence of Trichomonas and Candida. Positive criteria for a Gram stain included greater than 10 white blood cells per high-power field, gram-negative intracellular/extracellular diplococci (suggesting N gonorrhoeae), clue cells (suggesting T vaginalis), or direct visualization of T vaginalis organisms.  he appraised infectious agents were Coccobacilli, Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis, and clue cells (Gardnerella vaginalis). Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis, affecting over 3 million women in the United States annually. Depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. To date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. Differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (Amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) pH greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells.  Although the presence of clue cells and amine-like odor in KOH test have relationship with Gardnerella vaginalis, these tests could also suggest the presence of these mycoplasmas.

5a8980d2fcd1d6a10c00000d	Which is the main protein in brown adipose tissue (BAT) active in thermogenesis?	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria are distinct from their counterparts in other tissues in that ATP production is not their primary physiologic role. BAT mitochondria are equipped with a specialized protein known as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). UCP1 short-circuits the electron transport chain, allowing mitochondrial membrane potential to be transduced to heat, making BAT a tissue capable of altering energy expenditure and fuel metabolism in mammals without increasing physical activity. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is the hallmark protein responsible for cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism essential for survival and normal physiological functions in mammals. Both brown adipose tissue (BAT) (i.e.uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-based) UCP1's central role in non-shivering thermogenesis is acknowledged JAK2 promotes brown adipose tissue function and is required for diet- and cold-induced thermogenesis in mice.

Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). The combination of antiestrogen therapy and ribociclib, an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor, led to improved outcomes in women with metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, according to findings presented at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology.  OBJECTIVES: Cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4/6-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway hyperactivation is associated with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC). This study assessed the biological activity of ribociclib (LEE011; CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus letrozole compared with single-agent letrozole in the presurgical setting Importantly, 2 other CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib (LY2835219; Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011; Novartis), are in the late stage of clinical development.  After noting an inverse correlation with sensitivity to ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), we studied the combinatorial effect of these two agents using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, Ki67 immunostaining, timelapse microscopy and xenograft studies. Methods In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease.  Three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.  Clinical Development of the CDK4/6 Inhibitors Ribociclib and Abemaciclib in Breast Cancer. Targeted inhibition of CDK4/6 pathway by small-molecule inhibitors palbociclib (PD-0332991) and ribociclib (LEE011) resulted in inhibition of cell-cycle progression, amelioration of kidney injury, and improved overall survival.

60805c344e6a4cf630000001	Where is the organ of Corti located?	We used mouse cochlear hair cells and House Ear Institute‑Organ of Corti 1 (HEI‑OC1) cells to explore the relationship between mtDNA copy number and cell apoptosis We study the vibration modes of a short section in the middle turn of the gerbil cochlea including both longitudinal and radial interstitial fluid spaces between the pillar cells and hair cells to determine the role of the interstitial fluid flow within the organ of Corti (OoC).  The cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, vibrates because of external and internal excitations.  The cochlea, a coiled structure located in the ventral region of the inner ear, acts as the primary structure for the perception of sound. Along the length of the cochlear spiral is the organ of Corti, a highly derived and rigorously patterned sensory epithelium that acts to convert auditory stimuli into neural impulses.

5c74266a7c78d694710000a2	Which biological process takes place in nuclear speckles?	Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles  In a previous study (Melcák et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mRNA takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of RNA into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of RNA into the speckles.  Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.   Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity. Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity. DNAJC17 is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with splicing machinery components. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells.

5a7610af83b0d9ea6600001a	Which Janus kinase does decernotinib target?	The aim of this study was to evaluate the potency and selectivity of the investigational JAK3 inhibitor VX-509 (decernotinib) [(R)-2-((2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methyl-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)butanamide]against JAK3 kinase activity and inhibition of JAK3-mediated signaling in vitro and JAK3-dependent physiologic processes in vivo. These results demonstrate that VX-509 potently inhibits JAK3 in enzyme assays (Ki = 2.5 nM + 0.7 nM) and cellular assays dependent on JAK3 activity (IC50 range, 50-170 nM), with limited or no measurable potency against other JAK isotypes or non-JAK kinases. These findings demonstrate that VX-509 is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK3 in vitro and modulates proinflammatory response in models of immune-mediated diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and delayed-type hypersensitivity.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene and the spectrum of mutations among Greek-Cypriots with FMF-related symptoms was examined Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic periodic fever syndrome and characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, serositis, arthritis, dermal manifestations, and long-term renal complications. The MEFV gene was described in 1997 as the gene responsible for FMF and is inherited in autosomal recessive manner. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in theMEFVgene  MEditerranean FeVer (MEFV) gene encodes for the pyrin protein and a mutated pyrin is associated with a prolonged or augmented inflammation. The causative mutations for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) are located in the MEFV gene, which encodes pyrin.

The gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, encodes a protein called pyrin or marenostrin Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disorder due to MEFV mutations and one of the most frequent Mediterranean genetic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical findings and the most common mutated alleles of MEFV gene in a childhood population and to determine the sensitivity of the 12-mutation-strip assay test in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has been traced to mutations in the MEFV gene. BACKGROUND Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), characterized by recurrent fever and inflammation of serous membranes, is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene.

5545e65bd355485447000001	Patients of which disease could be treated by utilizing knowledge obtained from experiments suppressing TDP-43 toxicity in yeast?	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS	['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)']
5e35dc26158f994d3a000006	How many proteins have been queried for protein partners by the Drosophila protein interaction map (DPiM)?	Proteins perform essential cellular functions as part of protein complexes, often in conjunction with RNA, DNA, metabolites and other small molecules. The genome encodes thousands of proteins but not all of them are expressed in every cell type; and expressed proteins are not active at all times. Such diversity of protein expression and function accounts for the level of biological intricacy seen in nature. Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex "map" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization. Here we describe how the map has provided valuable insights into protein function in addition to generating hundreds of testable hypotheses. We also discuss recent technological advancements that will be critical in addressing the next generation of questions arising from the map.	['5,000']

55390901bc4f83e828000014	What is the effect of CRD-BP on the stability of c-myc mRNA?	CRD-BP shields c-myc and MDR-1 RNA from endonucleolytic attack by a mammalian endoribonuclease The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) has high affinity for the coding region determinant (CRD) of c-myc mRNA. Such affinity is believed to protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack  These results provide the first direct evidence that CRD-BP can indeed protect c-myc CRD cleavage initiated by an endoribonuclease CRD-BP: a c-Myc mRNA stabilizing protein with an oncofetal pattern of expression The Coding Region Determinant-Binding Protein (CRD-BP) is an RRM and KH-domain-containing protein that recognizes specifically at least three RNAs. It binds to one of the two c-myc mRNA instability elements CRD-BP has been assigned a role in stabilizing c-myc mRNA by preventing its endonucleolytic cleavage A 249-nucleotide coding region instability determinant (CRD) destabilizes c-myc mRNA. Previous experiments identified a CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) that appears to protect the CRD from endonuclease cleavage These data suggest that c-myc mRNA is rapidly degraded unless it is (i) translated without pausing or (ii) protected by the CRD-BP when pausing occurs Here, we confirm that human CRD-BP/IMP-1 binds to c-myc mRNA The coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) binds in vitro to c-myc mRNA and is thought to stabilize the mRNA and increase c-Myc protein abundance Two regions within c- myc mRNA determine its short half-life. One is in the 3'-untranslated region, the other is in the coding region. A cytoplasmic protein, the coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP), binds in vitro to the c- myc coding region instability determinant. We have proposed that the CRD-BP, when bound to the mRNA, shields the mRNA from endonucleolytic attack and thereby prolongs the mRNA half-life Developmental regulation of CRD-BP, an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes c-myc mRNA in vitro We previously isolated and characterized a coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) that might regulate c-myc mRNA post-transcriptionally CRD-BP binds specifically to the coding region of c-myc mRNA and might stabilize c-myc mRNA in vitro by protecting it from endonucleolytic cleavage	['To protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack.']
52efbfccc8da898910000018	At which kind of individuals is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?	sHT in older people should be not regarded as a unique condition, and moderately old patients (aged <70-75 y) could be considered clinically similar to the adult population, albeit with a higher optimal TSH target value. Conversely, the oldest old subjects should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. An appropriately powered randomized controlled trial of levothyroxine in SCH examining vascular outcomes is now warranted. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. Sustained normalization of thyroid function during l-T(4) replacement therapy significantly decreases baPWV in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with autoimmune chronic thyroiditis, suggesting the improvement of arterial stiffening and, consequently, possible prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest that L-T(4) replacement therapy may be especially beneficial in female subclinical hypothyroid patients with high baseline baPWV and pulse pressure. The beneficial effects of L-T(4) replacement therapy in decreasing arterial stiffening and thus preventing cardiovascular disease might be limited to this sub-population. Although a consensus is still lacking, the strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of levothyroxine replacement on markers of cardiovascular risk is the substantial demonstration that restoration of euthyroidism can lower both total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. Restoration of euthyroidism by levothyroxine (LT4) treatment may correct the lipid profile and cardiac abnormalities, especially in patients with an initially higher deviation from normality and higher serum TSH levels. Importantly, a strong association between SH and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, independent of the traditional risk factors, has been recently reported in a large cross-sectional survey (the Rotterdam Study). However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy.

5d35f1267bc3fee31f000004	Which is the effect of the HP1a protein on chromatin?	Here we show that PIWI, an ARGONAUTE/PIWI protein family member that binds to Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), strongly and specifically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), a central player in heterochromatic gene silencing. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) positively regulates euchromatic gene expression through RNA transcript association and interaction with hnRNPs in Drosophila. Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a) is a well-known conserved protein involved in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing in different species including humans. HP1a is associated with transcripts of more than one hundred euchromatic genes. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins, recognized readers of the heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and chromosome structure. heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). HP1a targets the Drosophila KDM4A demethylase to a subset of heterochromatic genes to regulate H3K36me3 levels. Enrichment of HP1a on Drosophila chromosome 4 genes creates an alternate chromatin structure critical for regulation in this heterochromatic domain. HP1a: a structural chromosomal protein regulating transcription. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a in Drosophila) is a conserved eukaryotic chromosomal protein that is prominently associated with pericentric heterochromatin and mediates the concomitant gene silencing.  Heterochromatin-associated interactions of Drosophila HP1a with dADD1, HIPP1, and repetitive RNAs. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) has conserved roles in gene silencing and heterochromatin and is also implicated in transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Maintenance of Heterochromatin by the Large Subunit of the CAF-1 Replication-Coupled Histone Chaperone Requires Its Interaction with HP1a Through a Conserved Motif. The chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is involved in the assembly of H3-H4 histone dimers on newly synthesized DNA and in the maintenance of a higher order structure, the heterochromatin, through an interaction of its large subunit with the heterochromatin protein HP1a As expected, active gene promoters are mostly not present in LADs, HP1a and Pc domains.  Finally, we find that HP1a also specifies initiation sites of nuclear envelope reassembly on undamaged chromatin. 	['heterochromatic gene silencing']

53148a07dae131f847000002	Which hormone abnormalities are characteristic to Pendred syndrome?	Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary among affected individuals and seem to be partially dependent on nutritional iodide intake. Elucidation of the molecular basis of Pendred syndrome and the function of pendrin has provided unexpected novel insights into the pathophysiology of the inner ear, thyroid hormone synthesis, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange in the kidney. Thyroid goiter was found in 46.5% of cases. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter. From age 15 years, her thyroid gland showed progressive enlargement accompanied by elevation of serum thyroglobulin reaching 10-fold the normal amount.  In summary, a molecularly confirmed PS patient showed goiter progression accompanied by elevated serum thyroglobulin and increased thyroidal iodine uptake, but normal serum TSH levels and normal iodine organification. A coherent organization of differentiation proteins is required to maintain an appropriate thyroid function in the Pendred thyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial organification defect of iodide.  The clinical phenotype of patients with Pendred syndrome and the fact that pendrin can mediate iodide efflux in transfected cells suggest that this anion exchanger may be involved in mediating iodide efflux into the follicular lumen, a key step in thyroid hormone biosynthesis.  Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapidly increase pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid cells.  These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it may have a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, coding for the anion transporter pendrin, are responsible for Pendred syndrome, characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness and dyshormonogenic goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial defect in iodide organification. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary and appear to depend on nutritional iodide intake.  Pendrin is mainly expressed in the thyroid, the inner ear, and the kidney. In the thyroid, pendrin localizes to the apical membrane of thyrocytes, where it may be involved in mediating iodide efflux.  Mutations of SLC26A4 cause an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, nonsyndromic deafness, and deafness as part of Pendred syndrome. SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney.  Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister. Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndromes, e.g. Pendred syndrome (PS) and resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct bilaterally. The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a diagnosis of PS. This is the first report of the cooccurrence, in the same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment. Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. Biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene lead to Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Thyroidectomy in a patient with multinodular dyshormonogenetic goitre--a case of Pendred syndrome confirmed by mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene. We report a young woman with genetically confirmed Pendred syndrome and discuss the current therapeutic strategies of dyshormonogenetic goitre. Management of a patient with Pendred syndrome requires careful follow-up and regular imaging of the thyroid.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment, presence of goiter, and a partial defect in iodide organification, which may be associated with insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis. Goiter development and development of hypothyroidism are variable and depend on nutritional iodide intake. Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and a partial iodine organification defect.  Levels of thyroid hormones were essentially normal in all patients: 2 patients had goiters and/or elevated serum thyroglobulin levels, whereas 2 other patients had positive thyroid antibodies and a positive perchlorate discharge test.  Pendred syndrome, defined as the constellation of goiter, sensori-neural hearing loss, and positive perchlorate discharge test, is the most frequent cause of congenital deafness.  Presuming the classic triad as the gold standard, we compared MRI findings in six such defined patients with six cases having goiter, hearing loss, and normal perchlorate discharge test.  For over 100 years after the first description of the disorder, the molecular pathology underlying the deafness and thyroid pathology in Pendred syndrome (PS) remained unknown.  We review the literature to identify genetic defects involved in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from circulation into the thyroid cell, defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell to the follicular lumen (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification. Among those causing dyshormonogenesis, the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes were initially described, and more recently PDS (Pendred syndrome), NIS (sodium iodide symporter), and THOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2) gene defects.  Among permanent CH cases, those with a goitre (n = 27) had an iodine organification defect (n = 10), Pendred syndrome (n = 1), a defect of thyroglobulin synthesis (n = 8), or a defect of sodium iodine symporter (n = 1), and in seven patients no aetiology could be determined. Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid.  Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations.  The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification.  Two patients were hypothyroid, two individuals were euthyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and thyroid goiter.  Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association between sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid swelling or goitre and is likely to be the most common form of syndromic deafness.  Pendred syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, and diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter). Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and a partial iodine organification defect Individuals were assigned affected status based on the characteristic clinical features of Pendred's syndrome, namely the presence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and the appearance in early life of a goitre	['thyroid hormone abnormalities']

52bf1d2e03868f1b0600000c	Which gene is associated with Muenke syndrome?	Abstract Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990s.  The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.  Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R)               ). The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.  The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene.   Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured. We report on a set of identical twins with a de novo C749G mutation in the FGFR3 gene codon 250 after a pregnancy complicated by prenatal exposure to Nortriptyline. Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730). The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred.  Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. We have used gene targeting to introduce the Muenke syndrome mu Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  To better define the clinical features of this syndrome, we initiated a study of the natural history of Muenke syndrome. To date, we have conducted a standardized evaluation of nine patients with a confirmed Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.  The patients were either placed into the "Muenke" group (n=11) or the "non-Muenke" control group (n=12) on the basis of a test for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene. P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. However, Muenke et al. [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16. Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).  In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.  Hypochondroplasia (HCH) and Muenke syndrome (MS) are caused by mutations on FGFR3 gene.	['Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3)']

58dcb47c8acda34529000020	What is the role of TAD protein domain?	 Thus, nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation TAD domain located at its C-terminal tail.  Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain.  Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max.  p300 worked synergistically with MRTF-A to activate the transcription of MYH9, MYL9 and CYR61. As identified by co-IP, p300 interacted with the C-terminal TAD domain of MRTF-A. To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. Physical interaction between the transactivation domain (TAD) of the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) and the KIX domain of the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is necessary for MLL-mediated transcriptional activation. The IE62 possesses several domains essential for trans-activation, including an acidic trans-activation domain (TAD), a serine-rich tract (SRT), and binding domains for USF, TFIIB, and TATA box binding protein (TBP) To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. We have characterized two transcription activation domains (TADs) in Da, called activation domain 1 (AD1) and loop-helix (LH), and have evaluated their roles in promoting peripheral neurogenesis. Particularly, the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and transactivation domains (TAD) play essential roles for their coactivating function.

Despite rapid advances in sequencing technologies, accurately calling genetic variants present in an individual genome from billions of short, errorful sequence reads remains challenging. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships between images of read pileups around putative variant and true genotype calls. The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling.

60314c361cb411341a00012e	What is Aortitis?	Aortitis is the inflammation of the aorta due to various causes.  Aortitis can be the manifestation of an underlying infectious or noninfectious disease process.  Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers in aortic wall. Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the aortic wall in aortitis Aortitis is classified as non-infectious or infectious.  "Aortitis" is a pathologic term that refers to an abnormal inflammation of the aortic wall. IgG4 related thoracic aortitis is a recent addition to the differential diagnosis for inflammatory aortic disease - a condition which is often underappreciated until complications arise such as aneurysmal formation or aortic dissection. C BACKGROUND Inflammation of the aortic wall, known as aortitis, is a rare clinical entity which is frequently asymptomatic, or identified when the patient presents with an aortic aneurysm or dissection. It i Syphilitic aortitis is a productive inflammatory process, the earliest and most constant feature of which is a perivascular round cell infiltration in the adventitia. Non-infectious aortitis represents a common feature of large-vessel vasculitides but can also be isolated or associated with other rheumatologic conditions. Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the aortic wall in aortitis, and spreads to the periaortic space in periaortitis. Takayasu aortitis is a well known yet rare form of large vessel vasculitis. Aortitis is a general term denoting inflammation of the aortic wall. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Aortitis is the inflammation of the aorta due Aortitis is the all-encompassing pathological term ascribed to inflammation of the aorta. Aortitis is typically a chronic, progressive disease manifestation associated with large vessel vasculitidies, most notably giant cell, Takayasu arteritis, and a newly described entity, isolated aortitis.                                           TEACHING POINTS                         :                          • Aortitis is an inflammatory condition of infectious/nonin Aortitis is a pathological term that refers to the inflammation of one or more layers of the aortic wall. Aortitis is a pathological term designating inflammation of the aortic wall, regardless of its cause. Aortitis is defined as an inflammatory process that involves one or more layers of the aortic wall (internal elastic lamina, tunica media, and adventitia) and can be caused by multiple mechanisms. Aortitis is a general term that refers to a broad category of infectious or noninfectious conditions in which there is abnormal inflammation of the aortic wall.	['inflammation of the aorta']
5ac3699f0340b9f058000001	Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?	 Recent comparative studies have begun to investigate the evolution of the sequence architecture within enhancers. A detailed analysis of the fast-evolving sparkling enhancer in Drosophila now identifies key compensatory mechanisms and 'grammar' elements that are critical for maintaining functional integrity. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. However, existing models specifically designed for regulatory sequences consider the independent evolution of individual transcription factor (TF)-binding sites, ignoring that the function and evolution of a binding site depends on its context, typically the cis-regulatory module (CRM) in which the site is located We summarize recent case studies and genome-wide investigations that have uncovered diverse mechanisms though which new enhancers arise We report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes.  Our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to comprehensively assess mRNA expression of 84 drug transporters in human colorectal biopsies and six representative cell lines, and to investigate the alteration of drug transporter gene expression after exposure to three candidate microbicidal antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (tenofovir, darunavir and dapivirine) in the colorectal epithelium. The outcome of the objectives informs development of optimal ARV-based microbicidal formulations for prevention of HIV-1 infection. We evaluated the adherence and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine, maraviroc, or both drugs for 28 days during a Phase I placebo-controlled trial in 48 HIV-negative sexually abstinent U.S. women aged 18-40. Use of a Vaginal Ring Containing Dapivirine for HIV-1 Prevention in Women. Methods We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine, a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, involving women between the ages of 18 and 45 years in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Results Among the 2629 women who were enrolled, 168 HIV-1 infections occurred: 71 in the dapivirine group and 97 in the placebo group (incidence, 3.3 and 4.5 per 100 person-years, respectively). The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0.05) than that in the placebo group. In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0.007) than that in the placebo group. Conclusions A monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection among African women, with increased efficacy in subgroups with evidence of increased adherence.  BACKGROUND: This was the first microbicide trial conducted in Africa to evaluate an antiretroviral-containing vaginal ring as an HIV prevention technology for women.OBJECTIVES: The trial assessed and compared the safety, acceptability and adherence to product use of a 4-weekly administered vaginal ring containing the antiretroviral microbicide, dapivirine, with a matching placebo ring among women from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a favourable safety and acceptability profile. If proven safe and effective in large-scale trials, it will be an important component of combination HIV prevention approaches for women. PURPOSE: To develop polymeric films containing dual combinations of anti-HIV drug candidate tenofovir, maraviroc and dapivirine for vaginal application as topical microbicides. Efficacy trials with a dapivirine-containing vaginal ring for HIV prevention are ongoing and plans to develop multi-purpose vaginal rings for prevention of both HIV and pregnancy have been elaborated. Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection by the candidate microbicide dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0.046) than that in the placebo group. In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0.007) than that in the placebo group. Within this study the in vitro bioactivity of dapivirine as compared to the NNRTI UC781 was further established and a quick dissolve film was developed for vaginal application of dapivirine for prevention of HIV infection. Dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is in development as a microbicide for the protection of women against HIV infection. Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Dapivirine from both IVRs was successfully distributed throughout the lower genital tract at concentrations>1000x the EC(50) against wild-type HIV-1 (LAI) in MT4 cells suggesting that IVR delivery of microbicides is a viable option meriting further study. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission. To assess the potential of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) to affect the genital distribution and local and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of the anti-HIV microbicide drug candidate dapivirine after vaginal delivery.Dapivirine-loaded, poly(ethylene oxide)-coated poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) NPs were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection.  CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.  Antiretroviral-containing vaginal microbicide rings, which release medication over a month or longer, may reduce these adherence challenges.ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection. Dapivirine demonstrated potent dose-dependent inhibitory effects against a broad panel of HIV type 1 isolates from different clades. Two large efficacy trials of a vaginal ring containing the investigational drug dapivirine demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing HIV infections in women in Africa. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Plasma dapivirine concentrations were low (<1 ng/ml) and remained well below those observed at the maximum tolerated dose for oral treatment (mean Cmax of 2286  ng/ml).CONCLUSION: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile that supports its use as a sustained-release topical microbicide for HIV-1 prevention in women. ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection. Dual segment polyurethane intravaginal rings (IVRs) were fabricated to enable sustained release of antiretroviral agents dapivirine and tenofovir to prevent the male to female sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.	['HIV']
552421082c8b63434a000005	What is the enzymatic activity of the breast cancer associated gene BRCA1?	E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known enzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger domain. BRCA1 nuclear transport and ubiquitin E3 ligase enzymatic activity are tightly regulated by the BRCA1 dimeric binding partner BARD1 and further modulated by cancer mutations and diverse signaling pathways. E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is not essential for mammalian cell viability or homology-directed repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the related BARD1 protein to form a heterodimeric complex that acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Because the enzymatic activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is conserved over a broad phylogenetic range, it is thought to be critical for the central functions of BRCA1. A mechanism for transcriptional repression dependent on the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, we identified an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism by which BRCA1 inhibits transcription. BRCA1 ubiquitinates the transcriptional preinitiation complex, preventing stable association of TFIIE and TFIIH, and thus blocks the initiation of mRNA synthesis.  In the structure the arrangement of the Ring-domains is similar to another H2A E3 ligase, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, but complex formation depends on an N-terminal arm of Ring1b that embraces the Bmi1 Ring-domain. Discovering the precise function of the breast and ovarian specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has proven to be quite complicated. It has been determined that BRCA1, together with BARD1, comprise an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Since it is now known that BRCA1 is an enzyme, the challenge for BRCA1 research is to learn how this enzymatic activity functions in normal breast and ovarian cells in order to suppress cancerous transformation. The BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene is expressed in all mammalian cells. Within these cells, the BRCA1 protein product interacts with several seemingly distinct nuclear complexes. Proteins within these complexes are potential targets for the E3-ubiquitin ligase activity associated with BRCA1:BARD1 complexes.  During both DNA replication and DNA repair, BRCA1 appears to serve both adaptor and enzymatic functions. Roles include transient physical recruitment of NBS1, gammaH2AX, FANCD2 and other proteins in specific repair associated complexes, and enzymatic activity as an E3-ubiquitin ligase against a subset of these proteins.  The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression.	['E3 ubiquitin ligase activity']

53035d7c2059c6d71c000085	What is commotio cordis?	Commotio cordis is a rare type of blunt cardiac injury in which low impact chest trauma causes sudden cardiac arrest, usually occurs from being struck by a projectile during sports. Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths. Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without structural damage of the heart and internal organs.  Although blunt, nonpenetrating chest blows causing sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis) are often associated with competitive sports, dangers implicit in such blows can extend into many other life activities.  Sudden death following blunt chest trauma is a frightening occurrence known as 'commotio cordis' or 'concussion of the heart'. Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without gross structural damage of the heart and internal organs.  Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease.  Nonpenetrating cardiac injuries due to direct precordial blunt impacts are a commonly encountered phenomenon in medicolegal offices. less commonly occurring manifestation of nonpenetrating injury is a concussion of the heart (commotio cordis), often with dramatic physiological consequences but no morphologic cardiac injury.

532498959b2d7acc7e000017	Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?	Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. In preclinical trials, this compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo xenograft mouse models.  In addition to the inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines, GRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changes, independent of hTR expression or telomere length. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths  Telomerase extension is less processive during the first few weeks following the reversal of long-term treatment with the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L), a time when Cajal bodies fail to deliver telomerase RNA to telomeres. The role of telomerase as an immunotherapy, as a gene therapy approach using telomerase promoter driven oncolytic viruses and as a small oligonucleotide targeted therapy (Imetelstat) will be discussed We then tested the efficacy of the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat on propagation and self-renewal capacity of TIC and normal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. R e telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC. Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase. Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo.  Short oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate conjugated to 5'-palmitoyl group, designated as GRN163L (Imetelstat), was recently introduced as a potent human telomerase inhibitor etelstat (GRN163L)--telomerase-based cancer therapy. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical trials. e telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, efficiently targets glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells leading to decreased proliferation and tumor growth. The effects of a novel human telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, on primary human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor-initiating cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo.  Imetelstat treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase (IC(50) 0.45 micromol/L). Long-term imetelstat treatment led to progressive telomere shortening, reduced rates of proliferation, and eventually cell death in GBM tumor-initiating cells.  We have found that prostate TICs have significant telomerase activity which is inhibited by imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), a new telomerase antagonist that is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for several hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Prostate TICs telomeres were of similar average length to the telomeres of the main population of cells and significant telomere shortening was detected in prostate TICs as a result of imetelstat treatment.  Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor.	['Human Telomerase']

The present metaanalysis was designed to assess the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on blood lipids, verifying possible differences across compounds of this class.METHODS: An extensive search of Medline and the Cochrane Library (any date up to December 31, 2010, restricted to randomized clinical trials, published in English) was performed for all trials containing, in any field, the words "sitagliptin," "vildagliptin," "saxagliptin," "alogliptin," "linagliptin," and/or "dutogliptin."  Sitagliptin (MK- 0431), Saxagliptin, Melogliptin, Linagliptin (BI-1356), Dutogliptin, Carmegliptin, Alogliptin and Vildagliptin (LAF237). Additionally, linagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are currently in phase III development in the United States while studies with another DPP IV inhibitor, dutogliptin, have been terminated (2). Testing the therapeutic equivalence of alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin or vildagliptin as monotherapy or in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this review is to compare the clinical pharmacokinetics of available DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) for the purpose of identifying potential selection preferences according to individual patient variables and co-morbidities. The reader will gain detailed pharmacological and clinical information on alogliptin, dutogliptin and linagliptin and will learn how these DPP IV inhibitors may widen the whole drug class. When considered in total, data reviewed in this report suggest that the best overall balance between potency and the clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics of distribution, metabolism and elimination may be observed with linagliptin followed closely by vildagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and alogliptin. Currently, there are four DPP IV inhibitors available in various countries-alogliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin (1). The various marketed or under developmental status, potential gliptins have been opted to build a pharmacophore model, e.g. Sitagliptin (MK- 0431), Saxagliptin, Melogliptin, Linagliptin (BI-1356), Dutogliptin, Carmegliptin, Alogliptin and Vildagliptin (LAF237) Currently, there are four DPP IV inhibitors available in various countries-alogliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin (1) Additionally, linagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are currently in phase III development in the United States while studies with another DPP IV inhibitor, dutogliptin, have been terminated (2) Recently, the SAVOR TIMI-53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus--Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-53) reported a significant increase in the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with saxagliptin in comparison with placebo Of these, two have been approved for clinical use in the United States: sitagliptin and saxagliptin Long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and metformin: an active-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, 78-week open-label extension study in patients with type 2 diabetes To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sitagliptin; and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes METHODS:  DATA SOURCES: an extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane Database search for 'vildagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'alogliptin', 'linagliptin' and 'dutogliptin' was performed up to 1 March 2013.

METHODS: We conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Collaborative database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin as initial combination therapy or as monotherapy in patients with T2DM by the end of December 2012, using the key words 'alogliptin', 'dutogliptin', 'linagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'vildagliptin' and 'metformin'.  Sitagliptin (MK- 0431), Saxagliptin, Melogliptin, Linagliptin (BI-1356), Dutogliptin, Carmegliptin, Alogliptin and Vildagliptin (LAF237).  Aim of the present meta-analysis is the systematic collection and synthesis of information on treatment-emergent cases of acute heart failure described in randomized clinical trials with DPP4.DATA SOURCES: An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database search for "vildagliptin", "sitagliptin", "saxagliptin", "alogliptin", "linagliptin", and "dutogliptin" was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to October 1st, 2013.  Quantitative model of the relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition and response: meta-analysis of alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin efficacy results. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors linagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are being developed and have been approved for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.  The objective of this model-based meta-analysis was to describe the time course of HbA1c response after dosing with alogliptin (ALOG), saxagliptin (SAXA), sitagliptin (SITA), or vildagliptin (VILD).  Discovery of highly potent DPP-4 inhibitors by hybrid compound design based on linagliptin and alogliptin. The dipeptidylpeptidase-IV inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin do not impair innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, BI 1356 inhibited DPP-4 more effectively than vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin and has the potential to become the first truly once-a-day DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Highly potent DPP-4 inhibitors have been identified by hybrid compound design based on linagliptin and alogliptin.  AIM: We assessed the efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin to reach the haemoglobin HbA1c target of <7% in people with type 2 diabetes.  Whether the DPP-IV inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin or saxagliptin impair immune responses is, however, currently unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and linagliptin, in type 2 diabetes.

5147c8a6d24251bc05000027	Which enzyme is deficient in Krabbe disease?	Krabbe disease is a lethal, demyelinating condition caused by genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and resultant accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), primarily in oligodendrocytes (OLs). In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. In almost all individuals with Krabbe disease, galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme activity is deficient (0%-5% of normal activity) in leukocytes isolated from whole heparinized blood or in cultured skin fibroblasts. This chapter describes in detail a practical procedure for the preparation of radiolabeled galactocerebroside and its use in the assay of galactocerebrosidase (GalCase), the enzyme deficient in globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease). Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by the pathogenomic accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), a substrate for the deficient enzyme galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase. Krabbe disease is an extremely rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 1,00,000 live births. It is caused by deficient activity of the Iysosomal hydrolase galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is characterized by the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is a substrate for the deficient enzyme (galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase). Krabbe disease (globoid-cell leukodystrophy; GLD) is caused by mutations in the GALC gene. Beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is a specific beta-galactosidase which is defective in GLD. Both galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (GALC-GC) and GALC-PS activities were reduced by at least 85% of the normal in all but 2 of the 10 GLD patients studied. Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. The disease can be diagnosed by detecting the deficiency of GALC activity (less than 5% of normal) in any available tissue sample. Globoid cell leukodystrophy, or Krabbe disease, is a severe disorder of the peripheral and central nervous system myelin caused by deficient galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GCL or Krabbe disease) is a recessive disease caused by mutations of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and twitcher is the murine model of GCL. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is the lysosomal enzyme deficient in human and certain animal species with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, the lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of the myelin glycolipid galactocerebroside. Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive inherited demyelinating disease, which is deficient in lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity is deficient in all patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD). Human galactocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Krabbe disease, was purified, through several hydrophobic column steps and gel filtration, 22,650-fold from human lymphocytes Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. 6-Hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (HMGal) has been shown to be a specific fluorogenic substrate of galactocerebrosidase and to facilitate the simple enzymatic diagnosis of Krabbe disease in human patients and in twitcher mice. The inherited deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.46: galactocerebrosidase) activity results in globoid cell leukodystrophy in humans (Krabbe disease) and in mice (twitcher mutant). The lack of complementation between Krabbe disease patient and twitcher mutant mouse cells provides further evidence that the twitcher mouse is an authentic murine model for Krabbe disease and supports the hypothesis that the mutations in both species are within the structural gene for the galactocerebrosidase enzyme. Galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase cross reacting material was demonstrated in brain, liver, and skin fibroblasts from patients with Krabbe disease. . In this study, LRs in the brain of the twitcher (TWI) mouse, a bona-fide model for infant variants of human globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease, were investigated. This mouse has deficient activity of GALC (beta-galactosylceramidase) that leads to a progressive accumulation of some galactosyl-sphingolipids in the brain. A GALC genotype with one deleted and one polymorphic GALC activity-reducing allele can lead to enzymatic and clinical signs of LOGLD in the absence of marked GALC-PS deficiency. Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is deficient in all tissues from human patients and animal models with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. The purification of GALC and the securing of amino acid sequence information will aid in the cloning of the GALC gene. This enzyme is deficient in human patients with Krabbe disease and several animal species.	['galactocerebrosidase']
601ebde11cb411341a00005d	Which R/Bioconductor package has been developed for gene expression signature searching?	signatureSearch: environment for gene expression signature searching and functional interpretation. signatureSearch is an R/Bioconductor package that integrates a suite of existing and novel algorithms into an analysis environment for gene expression signature (GES) searching combined with functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results. In a typical GES search (GESS), a query GES is searched against a database of GESs obtained from large numbers of measurements, such as different genetic backgrounds, disease states and drug perturbations. Database matches sharing correlated signatures with the query indicate related cellular responses frequently governed by connected mechanisms, such as drugs mimicking the expression responses of a disease. To identify which processes are predominantly modulated in the GESS results, we developed specialized FEA methods combined with drug-target network visualization tools. The provided analysis tools are useful for studying the effects of genetic, chemical and environmental perturbations on biological systems, as well as searching single cell GES databases to identify novel network connections or cell types. The signatureSearch software is unique in that it provides access to an integrated environment for GESS/FEA routines that includes several novel search and enrichment methods, efficient data structures, and access to pre-built GES databases, and allowing users to work with custom databases.

531464a6e3eabad021000014	Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?	The diagnosis of MLS was confirmed by genetic testing showing a hemizygous mutation of XK gene.  We performed a comprehensive mutation screen of VPS13A and XK, the gene responsible for ChAc and MLS, respectively, in 85 mood disorder subjects and XK in 86 schizophrenia subjects and compared the variants to 100 or more control alleles. We hypothesized that because the XK gene is X-linked, it would be easy to identify spontaneously arising red cells with a phenotype resembling the McLeod syndrome, which results from inherited XK mutations.  Identification and characterization of a novel XK splice site mutation in a patient with McLeod syndrome. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations in the XK gene whose product is expressed at the red blood cell (RBC) surface but whose function is currently unknown. The responsible XK mutation was characterized at the mRNA level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identified by genomic DNA sequencing, and verified by allele-specific PCR. A novel XK splice site mutation (IVS1-1G>A) has been identified in a McLeod patient who has developed hematologic, neuromuscular, and neurologic symptoms. This is the first reported example of a XK point mutation affecting the 3' acceptor splice site of Intron 1, and it was demonstrated that this mutation indeed induces aberrant splicing of XK RNA and lack of XK protein at the RBC membrane. The detailed characterization at the molecular biology level of this novel XK splice site mutation associated with the clinical description of the patient contributes to a better understanding of the phenotype-genotype correlation in the McLeod syndrome. Genetic test revealed a R133X mutation of the XK gene, confirming the McLeod syndrome. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a small deletion in the XK gene (938-942delCTCTA), which has been already described in a North American patient of Anglo-Saxon descent and a Japanese family, presenting with seizures, muscle atrophy or chorea yet absence of psychiatric features. A variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (XK) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of XK, and different deletion mutations.  The first case had been authenticated as a genuine McLeod both by serology and by genotyping (R222G missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in XK (IVS2+5G>A) and by serology exhibited very weak Kx antigen and no detectable Kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique.  Despite documented McLeod phenotype on RBCs, and identified mutations of XK, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest MLS.  The different XK mutations may have different effects upon the XK gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype. Insights into extensive deletions around the XK locus associated with McLeod phenotype and characterization of two novel cases. The McLeod phenotype is derived from various forms of XK gene defects that result in the absence of XK protein, and is defined hematologically by the absence of Kx antigen, weakening of Kell system antigens, and red cell acanthocytosis.  MLS is an X-linked multi-system disorder caused by absence of XK alone, or when the disorder is caused by large deletions, it may be accompanied with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), chronic granulomatous disease (CYBB), retinitis pigmentosa (RPGR), and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC).  Case 1 has greater than 1.12 million base-pairs (mb) deletion around the XK locus with 7 genes affected. The McLeod Syndrome, one of the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects.  Linkage analysis and sequencing revealed a XK gene mutation (McLeod syndrome). McLeod syndrome: life-long neuropsychiatric disorder due to a novel mutation of the XK gene. DNA studies demonstrated a single-base deletion at position 172 in exon 1 of the XK gene, giving rise to a premature stop codon at position 129 in exon 2. McLeod syndrome resulting from a novel XK mutation. MLS is caused by hemizygosity for mutations in the XK gene.  The patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an XK0 allele. The molecular basis of MLS in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion that includes exon 2 of the XK gene. This confirms that the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asymptomatic, also has the XK0 allele and is therefore likely to develop MLS. McLeod phenotype associated with a XK missense mutation without hematologic, neuromuscular, or cerebral involvement. XK gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased.  Known disease-causing XK gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated XK protein devoid of the Kell-protein binding site. Although the E327K missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of McLeod syndrome, the mutated XK protein seemed to be largely functional. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of XK and Kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in McLeod syndrome. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod.  We present six males (aged 29 to 60 years), with proven XK mutations, to discuss the chorea associated with McLeod syndrome. A spontaneous novel XK gene mutation in a patient with McLeod syndrome. Investigation of the patient's XK gene revealed a novel TGG- to-TAG transition at position 1023 in exon 3.  It is caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein, a putative membrane transport protein of yet unknown function.  Here, we present an immunohistochemical study in skeletal muscle of normal controls and a McLeod patient with a XK gene point mutation (C977T) using affinity-purified antibodies against XK and Kell proteins. The McLeod syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein. We describe a family with a novel point mutation in the XK gene consisting of a C to T base transition at nucleotide position 977, introducing a stop codon. he XK gene had a point mutation in the donor splice site of intron 1 (G>C).  Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed the mutation was a single C-nucleotide insertion at codon 151 in exon 2 of the XK gene, which resulted in a 3'-frameshift. It is caused by XK gene defects and may include large deletions in the Xp21 region.  We report a novel mutation in the XK gene (XK) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome.  The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (T) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK. The gene termed SRPX (sushi-repeat-containing protein, x chromosome) is deleted in an RP patient who also suffers from chronic granulomatous disease and McLeod syndrome.   The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. Fine mapping of the McLeod locus (XK) to a 150-380-kb region in Xp21. Gene deletion in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease and McLeod syndrome: fine mapping of the Xk gene locus.	['XK']
54d907c84b1fd0d33c000008	Which molecule is targeted by a monoclonal antibody Mepolizumab?	Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.  Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose, or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks.  Among developing therapies, biologics designed to block certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-5 (mepolizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab), have a greater chance of being used in the clinic. Imatinib and mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, may be useful in patients with eosinophilic myositis as part of a hypereosinophilic syndrome.  Recent results of the treatment of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with the anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab showed its efficacy and manageable safety profile.  Individuals also received a segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen (SBP-Ag) 1 month before and after administering a single dose of mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) to reduce airway EOS.  For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events.  Efficacy of anti-interleukin-5 therapy with mepolizumab in patients with asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials. Previous clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-5, in patients with asthma. In this large (616 patients), double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of mepolizumab (a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-5 binding to its receptor), patients were given placebo, 75-, 250- or 750-mg mepolizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for 1 year.  BACKGROUND: We examined levels of hyaluronan, a matrix glycosaminoglycan and versican, a matrix proteoglycan, in the sputum of asthmatics treated with mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) versus placebo to evaluate the utility of these measurements as possible biomarkers of asthma control and airway remodeling.  Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of the key cytokine implicated specifically in eosinophil maturation and survival, interleukin-5, to its receptor. Early studies suggest that inhibition of eosinophilic airway inflammation with mepolizumab-a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5-is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations.  IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).  Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab).  To date, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been developed that bind to human IL-5.  Mepolizumab (Bosatria(®), GlaxoSmithKline) is a biologic agent developed to treat asthma. It represents a humanized monoclonal antibody of IgG1 κ type, which targets human IL-5 and thus prevents its interaction with the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor. There has been a variable effect with the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast and promising early results with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5.  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/κ) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function. Mepolizumab blocks human IL-5 from binding to the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling.  Recently, encouraging results of treatment with monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-5, mepolizumab, have been published. This manuscript reviews the available treatments for HES and the range of side-effects associated with long-term corticosteroid use, and then focuses on the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab.  The therapeutic progress is primarily due to an explosion of biological therapies, particularly four of them very useful for internists (in an off label use) : Interleukin 1 inhibitors (anakinra, Canakinumab) to treat some auto inflammatory diseases (cryopirin associated periodic syndromes and deficency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist), monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5 (mepolizumab) to treat some hypereosinophilic syndromes and Churg and Strauss angiitis, interleukin 6 inhibitiors to treat multifocal Castleman's disease and adult Still disease, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (Bevacizumab) to treat hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES. Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with potent IL-5 neutralizing effects that represents a potential treatment for eosinophilic diseases. Anti-interleukin-5 antibody treatment (mepolizumab) in active eosinophilic oesophagitis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The pharmacodynamic effect of mepolizumab (a humanised anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody) in EoO was evaluated. We studied the prednisone-sparing effect of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, in a rare subgroup of patients who have sputum eosinophilia and airway symptoms despite continued treatment with prednisone.  Subjects received infusions of either mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (29 subjects), or placebo (32) at monthly intervals for 1 year.  A recent study showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL-5, mepolizumab, reduced glucocorticoid therapy in HES patients who did not possess the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation while controlling eosinophilia and preventing recurrence or progression of tissue damage.  METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Mepolizumab: 240563, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, SB 240563. Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical trials with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the treatment of severe asthma, nasal polyposis and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis (the latter two indications are classed as eosinophilia in the phase table).  A previous small dose-finding study found that mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, had no effect on allergen challenge in humans. No effect of anti-interleukin-5 therapy (mepolizumab) on the atopy patch test in atopic dermatitis patients. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5, which reduces peripheral blood eosinophils. Previously, we reported that mepolizumab treatment did not result in clinical improvement in AD.  Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, currently being evaluated, seems promising.  These include imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and more recently, mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody.  Anti-IL-5 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A monoclonal antibody to human interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) was developed for atopic diseases.  Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) reduces baseline bronchial mucosal eosinophils and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the reticular basement membrane in mild asthma.  Skin biopsies were performed in 24 atopic subjects at allergen- and diluent-injected sites before 6 and 48 h after, three infusions of a humanized, monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design.  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a humanized blocking monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) in patients with several forms of hyper-eosinophilic syndromes.  Anti-interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes. Bronchial biopsies were obtained before and after three infusions of a humanized, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) in 24 atopic asthmatics in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  GlaxoSmithKline (formerly SmithKline Beecham) is developing mepolizumab (SB-240563), a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-5, as a potential treatment for asthma and atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Blood, bone marrow, and airway mucosal biopsy specimens were examined before and after anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) treatment of asthmatic individuals in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) therapy induces bone marrow eosinophil maturational arrest and decreases eosinophil progenitors in the bronchial mucosa of atopic asthmatics. The role of eosinophils as effector cells in asthma pathogenesis has been questioned since an anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab), which depleted blood and sputum eosinophils, failed to inhibit allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness.  Mepolizumab (SB-240563), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human IL-5, is currently in clinical trials for treatment of asthma. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that chronic antagonism of IL-5 by mepolizumab in monkeys is safe and has the potential, through long-term reductions in circulating and tissue-resident eosinophils, to be beneficial therapy for chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases. Preclinical efficacy and safety of mepolizumab (SB-240563), a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-5, in cynomolgus monkeys. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/�) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function.

These data suggest that the repression of these factors might affect the maturation of invadopodia, inhibiting the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that 6-shogaol and pterostilbene can inhibit invadopodium formation and MMP activity in highly invasive breast cancer cells. EcTI was shown to decrease the expression and disrupt the cellular organization of molecules involved in the formation and maturation of invadopodia, such as integrin β1, cortactin, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, membrane type 1 metalloprotease, and metalloproteinase-2. Moreover, gastric cancer cells treated with EcTI presented a significant decrease in intracellular phosphorylated Src and focal adhesion kinase, integrin-dependent cell signaling components. We show that Abl kinases are activated downstream of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and are required for cancer cell invasion and matrix degradation induced by SDF1α, serum growth factors, and activated Src kinase. Moreover, Abl kinases are readily detected at invadopodia assembly sites and their inhibition prevents the assembly of actin and cortactin into organized invadopodia structures. We show that active Abl kinases form complexes with membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a critical invadopodia component required for matrix degradation. We have dissected the stages of invadopodium assembly and maturation and show that invadopodia use cortactin phosphorylation as a master switch during these processes. In particular, cortactin phosphorylation was found to regulate cofilin and Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization. Cortactin phosphorylation is required to release this inhibition so cofilin can sever actin filaments to create barbed ends at invadopodia to support Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. After barbed end formation, cortactin is dephosphorylated, which blocks cofilin severing activity thereby stabilizing invadopodia. In this report we show that the expression of activated versions of Src, Cdc42 and Rac1, or a kinase-dead but open form of the p21-activated kinase (PAK1), induces primary rat aorta VSMCs to form extracellular matrix-degrading actin-rich protrusions that are morphologically similar to the invadopodia formed by highly invasive tumor cells. The matrix-degrading structures are enriched in known markers for invadopodia, including cortactin and tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin and contain the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MT1-MMP and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Invadopodia formation by Src was dependent on Cdc42, Rac, and ERK, but not on p38 MAPK. Invadopodia formation induced by kinase-dead PAK1 required Src and ERK activity and a direct interaction with the exchange factor PIX. Dynamic interactions of cortactin and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase at invadopodia Small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition established that organization of invadopodia structure requires cortactin, whereas protease inhibitor studies identified membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as the key invadopodial enzyme responsible for gelatin matrix degradation in the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. The inhibition of invadopodial structure assembly by cortactin depletion resulted in a block of matrix degradation due to failure of invadopodia formation. Either protease inhibition or MT1-MMP siRNA depletion moderately decreased the formation of invadopodial structures that were identified as actin-cortactin accumulations at the ventral cell membrane adherent to matrix. Examination of cells at different time points as well as live-cell imaging revealed four distinct invadopodial stages: membrane cortactin aggregation at membranes adherent to matrix, MT1-MMP accumulation at the region of cortactin accumulation, matrix degradation at the invadopodia region, and subsequent cortactin dissociation from the area of continued MT1-MMP accumulation associated with foci of degraded matrix.

5ab90a79fcf456587200001b	What drug treatment can cause a spinal epidural hematoma?	Spinal epidural hematomas are rare entity in neurosurgery practice. Most of them are spontaneous due to anticoagulant therapy and called spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas (SSEHs). Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare disease that causes cord compression and neurologic deficit. Spontaneous SEH is related to minor trauma, bleeding disorders, and anticoagulant medications. Chronic Spinal Subdural Hematoma Associated with Antiplatelet Therapy. pinal subdural hematoma associated with antiplatelet therapy The authors report a case of acute spinal epidural hematoma occurring in a patient receiving antiplatelet drugs.  Spontaneous epidural hematoma of the spine (SEHS) is an extremely rare entity. Patients known to have thrombophilia or on anticoagulant drugs are the most affected Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail. In up to a third of cases (29.7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding. Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories. Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage. We report the case of a man of 65 who, at 20 and 37 days from surgery of C6 corpectomy, experienced two epidural hematomas at C7-D1. We assume that the pathogenic cause of this rare disease was an overlap between three main factors: the surgical aggression of the internal anterior epidural venous plexus; a possible increase of intra-thoracic pressure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and double antiplatelet drug therapy.

56c1f020ef6e394741000047	Which disorder is rated by Palmini classification?	This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB.  Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). MCD were classified following the existing classification schemes (Barkovich et al., 2012. Brain. 135, 1348-1369; Palmini et al., 2004. Neurology. 62, S2-S8) and the ILAE classification for FCD recently proposed by Blümcke in 2011.  DISCUSSION: This short review provides an overview of the issues which account for the varied historical approaches to FCD classification and descriptions of gross pathologic findings associated with FCD and an overview of two more recently developed and widely used schema, the Palmini et al. (Neurology 62: S2-8, 2004) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifications Blumcke et al. Epilepsia 52: 158-174, 2011.   In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis. Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Since early 2000, the definition of FCD has gradually been given a broader interpretation than the case described by Taylor et al., as shown in Palmini's classification (2004) or the newest classification (2011) proposed by the Neuropathology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). Palmini's classification proposed in 2004 is now widely used to categorize FCD. According to Palmini's classification system, these lesions were categorized as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II. In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis. According to Palmini's classification system, these lesions were categorized as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II.  According to Palmini's classification system, the following pathologic subgroups were identified: FCD type IA (3/38), FCD type IB (20/38), FCD type IIA (5/38) and FCD type IIB (5/38).  In addition, severe pathologic features (Palmini's classification, FCD type II) (p = 0.025) showed significant correlation with a better surgical outcome.  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells.  In detail, according to Palmini's classification, mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs) were disclosed in three patients, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type Ia in three patients, and FCD type Ib in five patients.  These results showed considerable improvement compared to a previous study evaluating the 2004 Palmini FCD classification.  In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis.  Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b.  Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA.  Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized.Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children. In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis. Since early 2000, the definition of FCD has gradually been given a broader interpretation than the case described by Taylor et al., as shown in Palmini&apos;s classification (2004) or the newest classification (2011) proposed by the Neuropathology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

51542dabd24251bc0500007d	Which gene test can be used for the X-linked myotubular myopathy?	X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe neuromuscular disease of infancy caused by mutations of MTM1, which encodes the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, myotubularin As a gene for X linked MTM was recently identified in Xq28, we screened the obligatory carrier mothers for mutation. We found a 4 bp deletion in exon 4 of the MTM1 gene, X-linked Myotubular Myopathy has clearly shown the benefits to be gained from a multinational research consortium with a common interest in identifying and cloning the MTM1 gene. Myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is an X-linked disease, characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with pathological features suggesting an impairment in maturation of muscle fibres. The MTM1 gene encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase consensus. myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital muscular disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the MTM1 gene, We established a colony of dogs that harbor an X-linked MTM1 missense mutation.Muscle from affected male dogs exhibits reduction and altered localization of the MTM1 gene product, myotubularin, and provides a model analogous to X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare congenital myopathy, usually characterized by severe hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency at birth, in affected, male infants. The disease is causally associated with mutations in the MTM1 gene, coding for phosphatase myotubularin. Mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a well-defined subtype of human centronuclear myopathy. MTM1 gene sequencing revealed a unique exon 7 variant in all seven affected males, causing a nonconservative missense change, p.N155K, which haplotype data suggest derives from a recent founder in the local population. X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLMTM), also called myotubular myopathy, is a severe congenital myopathy characterized by generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth and the typical histological finding of centralization of myo-nuclei. It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding the 3-phosphoinositides phosphatase myotubularin. sequencing all MTM1 exons X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital disorder due to loss of function mutations in the MTM1 gene, encoding myotubularin, a phosphoinositide phosphatase thought to have a role in plasma membrane homeostasis and endocytosis. Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin 1 protein (MTM1) are usually associated with severe neonatal X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM). However, mutations in MTM1 have also been recognized as the underlying cause of "atypical" forms of XLMTM in newborn boys, female infants, female manifesting carriers and adult men. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a recessive disorder, is caused by mutations affecting the myotubulatin (MTM1) gene located on the X chromosome. Most of the affected males die in the early postnatal period whereas female carriers are usually asymptomatic. The authors present a patient with the most severe X-linked recessive type (XLMTM). The diagnosis was confirmed and further specified by genetic analysis, revealing a novel frameshift mutation (1314-1315insT) of the myotubularin-coding MTM1 gene. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. MTM1, the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), is mutated in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe genetic muscular disorder Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase that acts on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate [PI(3)P], a lipid implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking and autophagy. It is encoded by the MTM1 gene, which is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a muscular disorder characterized by generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness at birth leading to early death of most affected males. The entire coding sequence of the gene was screened in 10 XLMTM patients using this technique. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; OMIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disease caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene. Mutations in the MTM1 gene cause X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM310400). We screened 29 independant patients with XLMTM phenotype and four with centronuclear myopathy. 87% (21/24) of patients with known MTM1 mutations showed abnormal myotubularin levels, including some with missense mutations. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) characteristically causes severe or fatal muscle weakness in male infants. Mutations in the gene MTM1, encoding the protein myotubularin, can be identified in most families. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscular disease characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, leading in most cases to early postnatal death. The gene responsible for the disease, MTM1, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, named myotubularin, which is highly conserved throughout evolution. X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a muscle disorder usually affecting newborn males. In the majority of cases, muscle weakness and hypotonia lead to a rapid demise at neonatal age. The responsible MTM1 gene is located in proximal Xq28. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe congenital muscle disorder due to mutations in the MTM1 gene. X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres. The gene responsible, MTM1, was identified recently by positional cloning, and encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP). X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MTM1) is a severe neonatal disorder often causing perinatal death of the affected males. The responsible gene, designated MTM1, was localized to proximal Xq28 and recently isolated. The characterization of MTM1 allowed us to screen for causing mutations in three families, previously investigated by linkage analysis. Using exon amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism, and subsequent sequencing analysis, three new mutations and their mutational origin were characterized by analyzing 10 exons.

5c8fef490101eac870000010	Through which protein interaction does MLP regulate F-actin dynamics?	Muscle LIM protein interacts with cofilin 2 and regulates F-actin dynamics in cardiac and skeletal muscle. This interaction has direct implications in actin cytoskeleton dynamics in regulating CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with maximal depolymerization enhancement at an MLP/CFL2 molecular ratio of 2:1. Deregulation of this interaction by intracellular pH variations, CFL2 phosphorylation, MLP or CFL2 gene mutations, or expression changes, as observed in a range of cardiac and skeletal myopathies, could impair F-actin depolymerization, leading to sarcomere dysfunction and disease.

We aimed to assess the asymptomatic Clostridium difficile carriage rates following fecal microbiota transplantation High-throughput DNA sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is becoming a more widely used technology for treatment of recurrent Clostridum difficile infection (CDI).  Fecal transplantation, the infusion of donor feces into a recipient's intestinal tract, has been used for decades to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and case reports document its use in the successful treatment of constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  Comparison of Different Strategies for Providing Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to Treat Patients with Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection in Two English Hospitals: A Review.Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a highly efficacious treatment for difficult cases of refractory and/or recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).  Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied to treat CDI.  While previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for FMT, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat CDI.  Complete Microbiota Engraftment Is Not Essential for Recovery from Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection following Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.

Fecal transplantation, the infusion of donor feces into a recipient's intestinal tract, has been used for decades to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and case reports document its use in the successful treatment of constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Here we present the case of a child with SBS and recurrent, debilitating D-lactic acidosis, which was successfully treated with fecal transplantation. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has an incomparable efficacy to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, with near 90% of success. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method for some patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, has emerged as a promising therapy for intestinal MDR bacterial decolonization. OBJECTIVES Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasingly being used for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (R-CDI) that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. BACKGROUND Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a diverse bacterial profile to the gastrointestinal tract and may effectively treat patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Bacterial communities from subjects treated for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), using either heterologous donor stool samples or autologous stool samples, were characterized by Illumina next-generation sequencing. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a compelling treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, with potential applications against other diseases associated with changes in gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, but well-designed, randomized-controlled trials and Long-term follow-up registries are stilt required. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and is considered as a treatment for other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. BACKGROUND Fecal microbiota microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor into an individual with CD infection (CDI) can resolve symptoms. Fecal microbiota transplantation is relatively simple to perform, well-tolerated, safe and effective in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with ulcerative pancolitis, as an alternative in case of antibiotic therapy failure. The use of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and coexistent inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection.

5717d86029809bbe7a000003	Which gene is involved in the development of Barth syndrome?	Tafazzin is a mitochondrial phospholipid transacylase, and its mutations cause Barth syndrome (BTHS) Tafazzin, a mitochondrial acyltransferase, plays an important role in cardiolipin side chain remodeling. Previous studies have shown that dysfunction of tafazzin reduces cardiolipin content, impairs mitochondrial function, and causes dilated cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ) A zebrafish model of human Barth syndrome reveals the essential role of tafazzin in cardiac development and function. Barth syndrome: cellular compensation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis inhibition due to changes in cardiolipin remodeling linked to tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutation. This resynthesis of deacylated cardiolipin from monolysocardiolipin occurs via the Barth Syndrome gene product tafazzin and acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 and the alpha subunit of trifunctional protein. We conclude that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant prevents cardiac dysfunction induced by tafazzin gene knockdown in cardiac myocytes and suggest mito-Tempo as a potential therapeutic for Barth syndrome and other dilated cardiomyopathies resulting from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Here, we combined patient-derived and genetically engineered induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with tissue engineering to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiomyopathy of Barth syndrome (BTHS), a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutation of the gene encoding tafazzin (TAZ). Mutations in the human TAZ gene are associated with Barth Syndrome, an often fatal X-linked disorder that presents with cardiomyopathy and neutropenia. A Novel TAZ Gene Mutation and Mosaicism in a Polish Family with Barth Syndrome Barth syndrome: cellular compensation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis inhibition due to changes in cardiolipin remodeling linked to tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutation Barth syndrome is caused by mutations in the TAZ (tafazzin) gene on human chromosome Xq28 BTHS is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the tafazzin (TAZ) gene.  This abnormality involves the deletion of the bases TGA starting at cDNA nucleotide 891 (c891_893delTGA), resulting in the absence of glutamic acid at codon 202 from a highly conserved area of the tafazzin protein, consistent with the diagnosis of Barth syndrome.  Novel mutations in the TAZ gene in patients with Barth syndrome. A zebrafish model of human Barth syndrome reveals the essential role of tafazzin in cardiac development and function. The Barth Syndrome gene TAZ has been identified and expression of the gene yields proteins known as tafazzins.	['Tafazzin (TAZ) gene']
5a88370c61bb38fb24000014	What is the function of the gene MDA5?	Sensing of viral RNA by the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) leads to innate antiviral response.  The host innate immune response to RNA virus infection primarily involves pathogen-sensing toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3 and TLR7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiates rapid innate antiviral responses. MDA5 forms a filament-like multimer along the dsRNA leading to oligomerization, which in turn activates the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to provide a signal platform for the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. The conformational switch of MDA5 causes antiviral defense, but excessive activation of the MDA5-MAVS pathway may result in autoimmune diseases. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, are crucial for host recognition of non-self RNAs, especially viral RNA.

55149f156a8cde6b72000013	Which gene fusion is the result of the "philadelphia translocation" or the "philadelphia chromosome" mutation?	Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cytogenetic abnormality associated with poor outcome in adults. This preliminary study, in the absence of substantial evidence, reported the prevalence of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in ALL patients by RT-PCR in Pakistan. The Philadelphia chromosome and its corresponding fusion gene, BCR-ABL, is one of the best-known genetic abnormalities in hematological malignancies. Major BCR-ABL translocation is much more common in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minor BCR-ABL in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions.  The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation leading to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome resulting in BCR-ABL gene fusion is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the presence of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR/ABL gene fusion on the derivative chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.  Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transforming abilities. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic progenitors from some CML patients. The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. The translocation event creates on the Philadelphia chromosome a fusion between two genes: bcr and abl. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Using specific probes for the BCR and ABL genes, results of FISH showed a three-way variant Philadelphia translocation (9;22;21)(q34;q11;p12) with a BCR/ABL fusion residing on the der(22) and the 3BCR region translocated on the short arm of the derivative chromosome 21. We report a cytogenetic study of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who, while displaying a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting from a standard t(9;22) at diagnosis, during the chronic phase (CP) showed disappearance of the Ph and occurrence of new chromosome changes, including a marker probably arising from a translocation involving chromosome 17 and the Ph. In situ hybridization confirmed the cytogenetic appearance and demonstrated that the breakpoint on the Ph marker occurred below the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. BACKGROUND: The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. In the great majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome produces fusion DNA sequences consisting of the 5 part of the major breakpoint cluster region-1 (M-BCR-1) and the ABL protooncogene which encodes for the P210BCR-ABL phosphoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Unique fusion of bcr and c-abl genes in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Expression of the ABL-BCR fusion gene in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation	['The BCR/ABL gene fusion', 'ABL/BCR fusion']

5c78080e7c78d694710000ae	What is the cause of Sandhoff disease?	Sandhoff disease (SD) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the β-subunit gene β-hexosaminidase B (HexB) in humans, which results in the massive accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and related glycosphingolipids in the nervous system. Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside.  Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of β-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Sandhoff disease (SD) results from mutations in the HEXB gene, subsequent deficiency of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase (Hex) and accumulation of GM2 gangliosides	['Sandhoff disease (SD) is caused by a mutation of the β-subunit gene β-hexosaminidase B (HexB) in humans']

5880be1dc872c95565000007	Which enzyme is inhibited by niraparib?	While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles.  Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. We report here that while the activities of the four human sirtuin isoforms SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 are blocked by sirtuin inhibitor Ex527 in vitro, they are unaffected by the seven clinical and commonly used PARP inhibitors niraparib, olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, veliparib, PJ34, and XAV939.  Results from a phase III trial indicate that maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor niraparib is more effective than placebo in slowing the progression of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In vivo anti-tumor activity of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in homologous recombination deficient and proficient ovarian carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have yielded encouraging responses in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), but the optimal treatment setting remains unknown. We assessed the effect of niraparib on HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as the relationship between certain markers of homologous recombination (HR) status, including BRCA1/2 mutations and formation of RAD51 foci after DNA damage, and response of these PDXs to niraparib in vivo. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib.  Background Niraparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1/2 inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients with ovarian cancer. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor, niraparib, sensitizes colorectal cancer cell lines to irinotecan regardless of MSI/MSS status. METHODS: Here we examine the response to niraparib, a potent PARP-1/PARP-2 inhibitor currently under clinical evaluation, in MSI versus microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo.  Several clinical-stage PARP inhibitors, including veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib, have been evaluated for their PARP-trapping activity.  Niraparib: A Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor for the Treatment of Tumors with Defective Homologous Recombination. We describe the rationale for this approach and the design and discovery of niraparib, a potent PARP-1/2 inhibitor with good cell based activity, selectivity for cancer over normal cells, and oral bioavailability.  Niraparib (50 mg/kg) inhibited PARP1 activity in vivo and extended survival of mice with orthotopic pHGA xenografts, when administered before IR (20 Gy, fractionated), relative to control mice (40 vs. 25 days) Niraparib (MK-4827), a novel poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitor, radiosensitizes human lung and breast cancer cells. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor niraparib (MK4827) in BRCA mutation carriers and patients with sporadic cancer: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Niraparib was characterized in a number of preclinical models before moving to phase I clinical trials, where it showed excellent human pharmacokinetics suitable for once a day oral dosing, achieved its pharmacodynamic target for PARP inhibition, and had promising activity in cancer patients.  The aim of this study was to assess niraparib (MK-4827), a novel poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells.  Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function.  Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827) > olaparib (AZD-2281) >> veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug.  Several clinical-stage PARP inhibitors, including veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib, have been evaluated for their PARP-trapping activity. These results indicate that human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective PARP-1 inhibitor, niraparib, in the in vitro setting. Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function.

Treatment with the PARP inhibitor, niraparib, sensitizes colorectal cancer cell lines to irinotecan regardless of MSI/MSS status. Other PARP inhibitors under clinical trials include rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and the "PARP-trapping" BMN-673. The high-throughput screens identified multiple clinical poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitors, such as olaparib (AZD-2281), niraparib (MK-4827) and BMN 673, as being selective for ERCC1 deficiency. Inhibition of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase1 (PARP1) impairs DNA damage repair, and early generation PARP1/2 inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, etc.) have demonstrated clinical proof of concept for cancer treatment. Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827) > olaparib (AZD-2281) >> veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug.

58bcabc702b8c6095300000e	What gene is mutated in Sickle Cell Anemia?	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder. SCA patients present clinical and hematologic variability that cannot be only explained by the single mutation in the beta-globin gene. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the HBB:c.20A>T mutation that leads to hemoglobin S synthesis. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single type of mutation, a homozygous A→T substitution in the ß globin gene. Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. The allele-specific PCR approach has been modified by introducing a second mismatch at the 3'-penultimate link of the primer and used to identify the sickle cell anemia mutation (A-->T transversion in the sixth codon of the human beta-globin gene causing Glu-->Val substitution in the protein), thus obviating the problem of an interpretationally ambiguous 3'-terminal mismatch including T residue. Sickle-cell anemia results from an A leads to T transversion in the second nucleotide of codon 6 of the beta-globin gene.

5a79d0b8faa1ab7d2e00000d	What cellular process are okazaki fragments associated with?	This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases α and δ carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively.  At DNA replication forks, the overall growth of the antiparallel two daughter DNA chains appears to occur 5'-to-3' direction in the leading-strand and 3'-to-5' direction in the lagging-strand using enzyme system only able to elongate 5'-to-3' direction, and I describe in this review how we have analyzed and proved the lagging strand multistep synthesis reactions, called Discontinuous Replication Mechanism, which involve short RNA primer synthesis, primer-dependent short DNA chains (Okazaki fragments) synthesis, primer removal from the Okazaki fragments and gap filling between Okazaki fragments by RNase H and DNA polymerase I, and long lagging strand formation by joining between Okazaki fragments with DNA ligase. Therefore, efficient processing of Okazaki fragments is vital for DNA replication and cell proliferation. RNA primer removal from Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand replication and the excision of damaged DNA bases requires the action of structure-specific nucleases, such as the mammalian flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1). Lagging strand DNA replication requires the concerted actions of DNA polymerase δ, Fen1 and DNA ligase I for the removal of the RNA/DNA primers before ligation of Okazaki fragments. Processing of Okazaki fragments to complete lagging strand DNA synthesis requires coordination among several proteins. During DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, short single-stranded DNA segments known as Okazaki fragments are first synthesized on the lagging strand. During DNA replication, repetitive synthesis of discrete Okazaki fragments requires mechanisms that guarantee DNA polymerase, clamp, and primase proteins are present for every cycle. DNA replication is a primary mechanism for maintaining genome integrity, but it serves this purpose best by cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. Unlike leading strand synthesis, lagging strand synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp FENs (flap endonucleases) play essential roles in DNA replication, pivotally in the resolution of Okazaki fragments.  Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) has been shown to remove 5' overhanging flap intermediates during base excision repair and to process the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA replication in vitro. Frequent priming of the discontinuous strand results in the formation of many small segments, designated Okazaki fragments. These short pieces need to be processed and joined to form an intact DNA strand During DNA replication, synthesis of the lagging strand occurs in stretches termed Okazaki fragments.  Fifty per cent of the genome is discontinuously replicated on the lagging strand as Okazaki fragments.  During replication, Okazaki fragment maturation is a fundamental process that joins discontinuously synthesized DNA fragments into a contiguous lagging strand. Even though synthesis and joining of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing these fragments is about twice that needed for leading strand synthesis.  Okazaki fragments that are intermediates during DNA replication. Deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments generates a comprehensive, genomic map of DNA synthesis, starting from a single asynchronous culture. Essentially all of the Okazaki fragments on replicating Simian virus 40 (SV40)DNA could be grouped into one of three classes Genome-wide Okazaki fragment distribution can differentiate the discontinuous from the semi-discontinuous DNA replication model. We uncover a dual regulatory role for chromatin during DNA replication: promoting origin dependence and determining Okazaki fragment length by restricting Pol δ progression.	['DNA replication']

54f9cb34dd3fc62544000002	Which protein has been found to interact with phospholamban (PLN) and is also an anti-apoptotic protein?	To identify additional proteins that may interact with PLN, we used the yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cDNA library. HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner. Analysis of the anti-apoptotic function of HAX-1 revealed that the presence of PLN enhanced the HAX-1 protective effects from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. These findings suggest a possible link between the Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the PLN/HAX-1 interaction. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms through which SERCA2a and PLN control cardiomyocyte function in health and disease. Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores. Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function. The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death. Here we identify HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade.  Furthermore, the effects of PLN and its phosphorylation on cardiac function are subject to additional regulation by its interacting partners, the anti-apoptotic HAX-1 protein and Gm or the anchoring unit of protein phosphatase 1.

601eafcd1cb411341a000056	Which deep learning framework has been developed for cancer molecular subtype classification?	DeepCC: a novel deep learning-based framework for cancer molecular subtype classification. Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity. Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.

531a34d5b166e2b806000036	Which gene is required for the efficient function of clopidogrel?	The CYP2C19 G681A single polymorphism has been proven to affect clopidogrel responsiveness.  This study investigated the effect of coexisting polymorphisms of CYP2C19 and P2Y12 on clopidogrel responsiveness and adverse clinical events in Chinese patient ssociation of a functional polymorphism in the clopidogrel target receptor gene, P2Y12 We tested for an association of gene sequence variations in P2Y12 and occurrence of neurological adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) during clopidogrel treatment Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP] family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12) Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping evaluated polymorphisms in the CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, P2Y12, and CES genes.  The prodrug clopidogrel requires activation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes for its antiplatelet effect Carriers of the CYP2C19*2 and *4 alleles showed reduced platelet inhibition after a clopidogrel 600-mg loading dose but responded to higher loading and maintenance dose regimens Carriers of the CYP2C19*17 T-allele, with increased clopidogrel activation, had a 37% relative reduction in the TLR incidence, the primary end point The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel and poor clinical outcome after stent implantation From these results it is suggested that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with subclinical thrombus formation among Japanese patients receiving clopidogrel.  To determine the effect of various SNPs on post-clopidogrel platelet reactivity and clinical outcome. MATERIALS & METHODS: Cytochrome 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function (LOF; *2, *3) and gain-of-function (GOF; *17) allelic variants, together with ABCB1 (3435 C→T and 2677 G→T/A) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1; 192 Q→R) SNPs were analyzed in 189 patients after elective stent implantation who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00638326) Chinese people are more frequent carriers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) loss-of-function alleles than Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 variants on clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in these patients The risk of a low response to clopidogrel and composite ischemic events increased with the number of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. However, there were not significant differences in clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes across the ABCB1 and PON1 genotype groups; bleeding was not significantly different across the CYP2C19, ABCB1, and PON1 genotype groups The CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles had a gene dose effect on the pharmacodynamics and composite ischemic events of clopidogrel in our study population. Neither the ABCB1 nor the PON1 genotype significantly influenced the antiplatelet effect and clinical outcomes of clopidogrel in these patients	['cytochrome P450, CYPC19']

590c74d170f9fc6f0f00001e	Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?	Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. The zinc cluster proteins Upc2 and Ecm22 promote filamentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sterol biosynthesis-dependent and -independent pathways. Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. RNA-seq analysis shows that hypoxic regulation of sterol synthesis genes in Y. lipolytica is predominantly mediated by Upc2. However, in yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans sterol synthesis is instead regulated by Upc2, an unrelated transcription factor with a Gal4-type zinc finger. Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. One such factor could be the mammalian equivalent of the gene product of UPC2. Simultaneous deletion of ECM22 and UPC2 as well as mutation of the three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter completely abolishes basal and pheromone-induced PRM1 expression, indicating that Ste12 and Ecm22/Upc2 control PRM1 transcription through distinct pathways. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place. A yeast mutant (upc2-1) with a defect in the aerobic exclusion of sterols was found to have increased sensitivity to LiCl and NaCl. The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. Secretion of apoE was achieved only by the use of a mutant (upc2) strain of yeast with the phenotype of enhanced uptake and intracellular esterification of exogenous cholesterol. Gas chromatographic analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus yeast sterol.. In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the zinc cluster transcription factor Upc2p has been shown to regulate the expression of ERG11 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis upon exposure to azole antifungals. By comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole-resistant isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p.

5a76179d83b0d9ea66000021	Which algorithm has been proposed for efficient storage of WGS variant calls?	SeqArray-a storage-efficient high-performance data format for WGS variant calls. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are being generated at an unprecedented rate. Analysis of WGS data requires a flexible data format to store the different types of DNA variation. Variant call format (VCF) is a general text-based format developed to store variant genotypes and their annotations. However, VCF files are large and data retrieval is relatively slow.

Transport proteins, including members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP)/ABCC subfamily, have been recognized to contribute to the latter function. MRP5 (ABCC5) was identified as transmembrane transport protein for cyclic nucleotides, especially 3',5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP), indicating an additional role in signal transduction and a potential role in placenta development. According to the new nomenclature of human ABC transporter genes, the 'ABCC' gene sub-family comprises three classes involving multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), sulfonylurea receptors (SURs), and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). With the addition of these two genes, the complete human ABCC subfamily has 12 identified members (ABCC1-12), nine from the multidrug resistance-like subgroup, two from the sulfonylurea receptor subgroup, and the CFTR gene. Identification and bioinformatic characterization of a multidrug resistance associated protein (ABCC) gene in Plasmodium berghei. One major group of transporters is known as multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP; ABCC gene family). On the other hand, several human multidrug resistance proteins [human ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily C (ABCC)] cause resistance against nucleoside analogs and mediate transport of phosphorylated nucleoside derivatives out of the cells in an ATP-dependent manner. According to the new nomenclature of human ABC transporter genes, the 'ABCC' gene sub-family comprises three classes involving multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), sulfonylurea receptors (SURs), and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several MRP/ABCC members (MRPs 1-3) are associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. In vitro, the MRP/ABCC transporters can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, arsenical and antimonial oxyanions, peptide-based agents, and in concert with alterations in phase II conjugating or biosynthetic enzymes, classical alkylating agents, alkylating agents. The human MRP/ABCC transporters except MRP9/ABCC12 are all able to transport organic anions, such as drugs conjugated to glutathione, sulphate or glucuronate. The ABCC multidrug resistance associated proteins (ABCC-MRP), a subclass of ABC transporters are involved in multiple physiological processes that include cellular homeostasis, metal detoxification, and transport of glutathione-conjugates. he ABCC subfamily of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which were formerly known as multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRPs), consists of closely related members found in all eukaryotic organisms. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a superfamily of membrane proteins that are best known for their ability to transport a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous substances across membranes against a concentration gradient via ATP hydrolysis. There are seven subfamilies of human ABC transporters, one of the largest being the 'C' subfamily (gene symbol ABCC). Nine ABCC subfamily members, the so-called multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) 1-9, have been implicated in mediating multidrug resistance in tumor cells to varying degrees as the efflux extrude chemotherapeutic compounds (or their metabolites) from malignant cells	['ATP dependent small molecule transporter']

5a8718c861bb38fb24000008	What are check point inhibitors?	 Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways.  These next generation agents with novel mechanisms of action as well as targeted therapies are being used both in the preclinical and clinical settings for patients with myeloma. These agents include monoclonal antibodies, deacetylase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, agents affecting various signaling pathways, immune check point inhibitors, and other targeted therapies Immune check point inhibitors may be of critical importance for the design of future immunotherapy approaches in GBM management. Immune check-point inhibitors should be considered a promising treatment option in GBM. Immune check-point inhibitors are now employed as single-agents in current practice for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while combinations of different inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials. Check point antibody inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, are a novel class of inhibitors that function as a tumor suppressing factor via modulation of immune cell-tumor cell interaction. The recent successes of immune check point targeting therapies in treating cancer patients has driven a resurgence of interest in targeting these pathways in chronically infected patients. These checkpoint blockers are rapidly becoming a highly promising cancer therapeutic approach that yields remarkable antitumor responses with limited side effects. The survival of tumors in several cases is assisted by checkpoint immunomodulation to maintain the imbalance between immune surveillance and cancer cell proliferation. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. The treatment of melanoma is evolving rapidly over the past few years. Patients with BRAFv600 mutations can be treated with a combination of a BRAF-inhibitor and an MEK-inhibitor. Patients with BRAF wild-type tumors and BRAFv600 mutated tumors can be treated with immunotherapy i.e. check point inhibitors. Till now, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer looked dreadful; thus the search for newer better approaches for this lethal disease has been a strategic target for cancer researchers. In recent years, important immunobiological aspects of the tumor have been revealed with the subsequent proposal of immune check point inhibitors to target these pathways. Inhibitory receptors on immune system cells respond to membrane-bound and soluble ligands to abort or mitigate the intensity of immune responses by raising thresholds of activation, halting proliferation, favoring apoptosis or inhibiting/deviating effector function differentiation. Such evolutionarily selected inhibitory mechanisms are termed check-points and therefore check-point inhibitors empower any ongoing anti-cancer immune response that might have been too weak or exhausted.

60320ef51cb411341a000130	What is a decoy exosome?	exosomes display a large repertoire of tumor antigens that induce autoantibodies and exert a decoy function against complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Acting as a decoy, the NKG2D ligand-bearing exosomes downregulate the in vitro NKG2D receptor-mediated cytotoxicity and thus impair NK-cell function. I Acting as a decoy, the HSP-bearing exosomes efficiently stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity and granzyme B production, up-regulated the expression of inhibitory receptor CD94, and down-regulated the expression of activating receptors CD69, NKG2D, and NKp44.

5e30b870fbd6abf43b000038	Which graph database is used by the Reactome graph database?	Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.

54f5bc7d5f206a0c06000001	What is the function of caspases?	Caspases are the ultimate executors of the apoptotic programmed cell death pathway. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases coordinate the morphological and biochemical events that typify apoptosis.  Caspase function is known to be essential for cell death by apoptosis, Caspases, initially identified as a family of proteases regulating cell death, have been found to have nonapoptotic functions as well. . As in other organisms, apoptosis is executed by caspases. Caspases are intracellular proteases that propagate programmed cell death, proliferation, and inflammation.  Apoptosis is dependent upon caspase activation leading to substrate cleavage and, ultimately, cell death. Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine proteases that constitute the effector arm of the apoptotic machinery. Caspases are critical mediators of apoptosis, the principle mechanism by which extra and harmful cells are eliminated to ensure proper development and maintain cellular homeostasis in all multicellular organisms.  Caspases (cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases) are at the core of the cell's suicide machinery. These enzymes, once activated, dismantle the cell by selectively cleaving key proteins after aspartate residues.  Programmed cell death plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis during animal development, and has been conserved in animals as different as nematodes and humans.

5fdb1023a43ad31278000009	Which gene is responsible for the Liebenberg syndrome?	Liebenberg syndrome is caused by a deletion upstream to the PITX1 gene resulting in transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics The deleted region is upstream to the PITX1 gene.  We therefore re-define the phenotype of Liebenberg syndrome as a transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics and speculate that the area of deletion contains a regulatory sequence that suppresses the expression of PITX1 in the upper limb buds. The structural variations seem to result in an ectopic expression of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) in the forelimb causing a partial arm-to-leg transformation in these patients. We discuss the genetic abnormality that causes Liebenberg syndrome, the genomic rearrangement at the PITX1 locus on chromosome 5 ng CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the mouse and showed that the promoter of the housekeeping gene H2afy insulates the Pen enhancer from Pitx1 in forelimbs; its loss leads to misexpression of Pitx1 by the pan-limb activity of the Pen enhancer causing Liebenberg syndrome.CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that housekeeping promoters may titrate promiscuous enhancer activity to ensure normal morphogenesis.

Here, we show that, in cancer cells, the epigenetic remodeling of chromatin into hypoacetylated domains covered with histone H3K27 trimethylation is paralleled by changes in higher-order chromatin structures.  There are data showing coordinate regulation between DNAme and H3K27me3, which are both involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27, which establishes H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic marks that promote tissue-specific differentiation by silencing ectopic gene programs. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation.

Biallelic mutations of the human RNU4ATAC gene, which codes for the minor spliceosomal U4atac snRNA, cause the developmental disorder, MOPD I/TALS To date, nine separate mutations in RNU4ATAC have been identified in MOPD I patients. In this report, we establish a mechanistic basis for MOPD I disease and show that the inefficient splicing of genes containing U12-dependent introns in patient cells is due to defects in minor tri-snRNP formation, and the MOPD I-associated RNU4ATAC mutations can affect multiple facets of minor snRNA function. A homozygous mutation in RNU4ATAC as a cause of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I) with associated pigmentary disorder.

58e9e7aa3e8b6dc87c00000d	Which is the major RNA editing enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster?	Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. dADAR also re-codes its own transcript, but the consequences of this auto-regulation in vivo are unclear Novel putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, Dalpha5, Dalpha6 and Dalpha7, in Drosophila melanogaster identify a new and highly conserved target of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-mediated A-to-I pre-mRNA editing The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing Aside from their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is not well understood.Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg. The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing.

In this research we demonstrate a model for Lesch-Nyhan disease by mutating the HPRT1 gene in human ES cells using homologous recombination.

Molecular basis of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency in a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Production of a model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mice. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism associated with a virtually complete deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT). Normally spliced HPRT mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in this patient, in control subjects, and in two Lesch Nyhan patient with splice mutations excluding exon 4 (patient B) and exon 8 (patient C) who had clinically a Lesch Nyhan disease phenotype. A minor amount of normally spliced HPRT mRNA was found in all the patients.  Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by lack of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. Mutations in HPRT1 gene show variability in type and location within the gene, and in certain patients the HPRT coding sequence is normal and the molecular defect cannot be found. HPRT gene point mutations in three gouty arthritis and one Lesch-Nyhan patient have been identified by peptide sequencing. Six gross gene rearrangements have been identified in Lesch-Nyhan HPRT genes. In two other mutants causing Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a portion of the HPRT gene was deleted, and RNA splicing was missing in both mutants. Five independent mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene were identified in a partially HPRT deficient patient with gout and in four Lesch-Nyhan patients. Normally spliced HPRT mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in this patient, in control subjects, and in two Lesch Nyhan patient with splice mutations excluding exon 4 (patient B) and exon 8 (patient C) who had clinically a Lesch Nyhan disease phenotype.

The interaction between the (epi)genetic makeup of an individual and his/her environmental exposure record (exposome) is accepted as a determinant factor for a significant proportion of human malignancies. The high-throughput and holistic approaches to biomarker discovery used extensively in large-scale molecular epidemiological exposome are also discussed in the context of human exposure to environmental stressors Experimental data strongly suggests a complex interaction between the exposome (or environmental influences) and genome (genetic material) to produce epigenetic changes (epigenome) Exposome factors including nutrition, medication, occupational factors, pollutants, climatic factors, and psychosocial and lifestyle factors may impact on the course and severity of acne and on treatment efficacy  The exposome is a novel conceptual framework that allows for concurrent examination of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including environmental exposures, as well as changes in exposures over time, to elucidate the complex environmental factors that affect health outcomes.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus houses the central circadian clock and is characterized by the timely regulated expression of clock genes. Clock genes control circadian rhythms both centrally, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain and peripherally, within every organ of the body. The mammalian circadian system consists of a central oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which coordinates peripheral clocks in organs throughout the body. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied,   In mammals, a master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, adjusts timing of other self-sustained oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs. Circadian clocks are endogenous and biological oscillations that occur with a period of<24 h. In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is linked to peripheral tissues through neural and hormonal signals.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls circadian rhythms in mammals The environmental light-dark (LD) cycle entrains the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mammals. Although circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior are dependent upon a biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the molecular mechanism of this clock is in fact cell autonomous and conserved in nearly all cells of the body. The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a central pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsidiary oscillators in nearly all body cells. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain is the circadian center, relaying rhythmic environmental and behavioral information to peripheral tissues to control circadian physiology.  The nerve center responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm is located in a cluster of cells known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus	['suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in the brain']

During the past year, two SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Currently dapagliflozin, one of the three most advanced SGLT2 inhibitors in the development (along with canagliflozin and empagliflozin), is already in the market in few European countries and canagliflozin has been approved from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in US. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition with canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This report reviews the potentially beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically focusing on canagliflozin, the only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in the United States. The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin lowered blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight, with increased risk of urogenital infections in Phase 2 studies.  Canagliflozin (Invokana™), an oral selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is under global development with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Canagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved in the USA and is under regulatory review in the EU.  Canagliflozin , an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Canagliflozin is an orally administered sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we summarize recent animal and human studies on ipragliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors including dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, tofogliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor, is also a low-potency SGLT1 inhibitor.  Canagliflozin reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin by increasing UGE (via renal SGLT2 inhibition) and delaying RaO, likely due to intestinal SGLT1 inhibition.

5c581e1507647bbc4b00001c	Which algorithm has been developed for trio-based benchmarking of variant calls?	geck: trio-based comparative benchmarking of variant calls. Classical methods of comparing the accuracies of variant calling pipelines are based on truth sets of variants whose genotypes are previously determined with high confidence. An alternative way of performing benchmarking is based on Mendelian constraints between related individuals. Statistical analysis of Mendelian violations can provide truth set-independent benchmarking information, and enable benchmarking less-studied variants and diverse populations.Results: We introduce a statistical mixture model for comparing two variant calling pipelines from genotype data they produce after running on individual members of a trio. We determine the accuracy of our model by comparing the precision and recall of GATK Unified Genotyper and Haplotype Caller on the high-confidence SNPs of the NIST Ashkenazim trio and the two independent Platinum Genome trios. We show that our method is able to estimate differential precision and recall between the two pipelines with 10-3 uncertainty.	['geck']
5ac09a7b19833b0d7b000001	Where is the EpCam protein mainly located?	The following cell-surface markers were immunohistochemically analyzed: E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), human epidermal growth receptor type 2 (Her2/neu), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), αvβ6 integrin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Tumor cells display increased EpCAM expression that often correlates with the loss of strict basolateral localization. Papillary thyroid carcinoma shows loss of EpCAM membranous expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear accumulation. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (CD326) is a surface glycoprotein expressed by invasive carcinomas and some epithelia. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is frequently and highly expressed on carcinomas, tumor-initiating cells, selected tissue progenitors, and embryonic and adult stem cells Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in human epithelioma but with relatively low expression in normal epithelial tissues.

58bc5e2202b8c60953000002	Which human disease is associated with mutated UBQLN2	Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice. UBQLN2 mutations are detected in ALS cases. C9ORF72 and UBQLN2 mutations are causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in New Zealand Missense mutations in ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2) cause ALS with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD).  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent motor neuron disease in adults. Classical ALS is characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons leading to progressive paralysis. Approximately 10 % of ALS patients have familial form of the disease. Numerous different gene mutations have been found in familial cases of ALS, such as mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS), C9ORF72, ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), optineurin (OPTN) and others. A mutation in the ubiquilin 2 gene (UBQLN2) was recently identified as a cause of X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD)  Interest in the proteins has been heightened by the discovery that gene mutations in UBQLN2 cause dominant inheritance of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

5e355e20fbd6abf43b000065	Which gene is frequently involved in autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD)?	An LMNB1 Duplication Caused Adult-Onset Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy in Chinese Family: Clinical Manifestations, Neuroradiology and Genetic Diagnosis. Duplication or over expression of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene causes ADLD. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive clinical evaluation and genetic detection for a Chinese family with ADLD. The proband is a 52-year old man manifested with autonomic abnormalities, pyramidal tract dysfunction. MRI brain scan identified bilateral symmetric white matter (WM) hyper-intensities in periventricular and semi-oval WM, cerebral peduncles and middle cerebellar peduncles. The proband has a positive autosomal dominant family history with similar clinical manifestations with a trend of genetic anticipation. In order to understand the genetic cause of the disease in this family, target exome capture based next generation sequencing has been done, but no causative variants or possibly pathogenic variants has been identified. However, Multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) showed whole duplication of LMNB1 gene which is co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family. This is the first genetically confirmed LMNB1 associated ADLD pedigree from China. Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. However, as only a few cases have been analyzed in detail, the mechanisms underlying LMNB1 duplications are unclear. We report the detailed molecular analysis of the largest collection of ADLD families studied, to date. We have identified the minimal duplicated region necessary for the disease, defined all the duplication junctions at the nucleotide level and identified the first inverted LMNB1 duplication. Duplication of the LMNB1 gene is the genetic cause of ADLD, yet the pathogenetic mechanism is not defined. In this study, we analysed cells and muscle tissue from three patients affected by ADLD, carrying an extra copy of the LMNB1 gene. Adult-onset autosomal-dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder characterized by early autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, pyramidal tract and cerebellar dysfunction, and white matter loss in the central nervous system. ADLD is caused by duplication of the LMNB1 gene, which results in increased lamin B1 transcripts and protein expression. How duplication of LMNB1 leads to myelin defects is unknown.  Lamin B1 duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy. ADLD is associated with duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene but the mechanism by which the rearrangement conveys the phenotype is not fully defined. We analyzed four unrelated families segregating ADLD with autonomic symptoms for duplications of the LMNB1 gene. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed novel duplications spanning the entire LMNB1 gene in probands from each of the four families. We then analyzed the expression of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes by Western blot analysis in five patients from two available families. The protein levels of lamin B1 were found significantly increased. These results indicate that the ADLD phenotype associated with LMNB1 duplications is mediated by increased levels of the lamin B1 protein. Furthermore, we show that a molecular diagnosis for ADLD with autonomic symptoms can be obtained by a direct analysis of lamin B1 in peripheral leukocytes. Genomic duplications mediate overexpression of lamin B1 in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) with autonomic symptoms.

To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ). Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) gene.  Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder , is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein , lamin B1 , and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene.  As a proof-of-concept , we studied autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy ( ADLD ) due to lamin B1 ( LMNB1 ) duplication , a hereditary , progressive and fatal disorder affecting myelin in the CNS.  We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy ( ADLD) , a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease.

Chromosomal rearrangements with duplication of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene underlie autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), a rare neurological disorder in which overexpression of LMNB1 causes progressive central nervous system demyelination. However, we previously reported an ADLD family (ADLD-1-TO) without evidence of duplication or other mutation in LMNB1 despite linkage to the LMNB1 locus and lamin B1 overexpression. Through parallel studies, we investigated both loss of genetic material and chromosomal rearrangement as possible causes of LMNB1 overexpression, and found that ADLD-1-TO plausibly results from an enhancer adoption mechanism. Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disorder, is the only human disease that has been linked to mutations of the nuclear lamina protein, lamin B1, and is primarily caused by duplications of the LMNB1 gene. Objective To characterize the genetic and clinical features of patients with autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD) carrying duplication and deletion upstream of lamin B1 (LMNB1). ABSTRACT Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is an adult onset demyelinating disorder that is caused by duplications of the lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Duplications of lamin B1 (LMNB1) at 5q23 are implicated in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) having been described in six families with diverse ethnic background but with a homogeneous phenotype. INTRODUCTION: adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare inherited disorder due to a duplication of lamin-B1 (LMNB1) gene. While at least a dozen disorders are associated with LMNA, the focus of this review is Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD), the only disease associated with the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1).

58a5a51060087bc10a000021	Which NADPH oxidase family member requires interaction with NOXO1 for function?	A unique member of this family, Nox1 oxidase, functions as either a canonical or hybrid system using Nox organizing subunit 1 (NoxO1) or p47(phox), respectively, the latter of which is functional in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).  Phosphorylation of Noxo1 at threonine 341 regulates its interaction with Noxa1 and the superoxide-producing activity of Nox1. Superoxide production by Nox1, a member of the Nox family NAPDH oxidases, requires expression of its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and Noxa1 (Nox activator 1) and is markedly enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of Thr341 allows Noxo1 to sufficiently interact with Noxa1, an interaction that participates in Nox1 activation. Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 appears to play a crucial role in PMA-elicited activation of Nox1, providing a molecular link between PKC-mediated signal transduction and Nox1-catalyzed superoxide production. Furthermore, Ser154 in Noxo1 is phosphorylated in both resting and PMA-stimulated cells, and the phosphorylation probably participates in a PMA-independent constitutive activity of Nox1. Ser154 may also be involved in protein kinase A (PKA) mediated regulation of Nox1;  Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 and at Ser154 appears to regulate Nox1 activity in different manners. The activity of other Nox enzymes such as gp91(phox)/Nox2 and Nox1 is known to absolutely require both an organizer protein (p47(phox) or Noxo1) andanactivatorprotein (p67(phox) or Noxa1); for the p47(phox)-dependent activation of these oxidases, treatment of cells with stimulants such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is also indispensable.  Studies of cytosolic co-factors showed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NOX1 was absolutely required for activation with NOXO1 and NOXA1 and that this activity required interaction of the putative NADPH-binding region of this domain with NOXA1. Additionally, NADPH oxidase Organizer 1 (NoxO1) is shown to interact with the NADPH-binding region of Nox1. Activation of the non-phagocytic superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1, complexed with p22(phox) at the membrane, requires its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 and Noxa1. NOXO1 phosphorylation on serine 154 is critical for optimal NADPH oxidase 1 assembly and activation. Activation of the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1 requires both the organizer protein Noxo1 and the activator protein Noxa1. NOX1, an NADPH oxidase homologue that is most abundantly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the regulatory subunits NOXO1 (NOX organizing protein 1) and NOXA1 (NOX activating protein 1), as well as the flavocytochrome component p22(phox) for maximal activity. Activation of Nox1, an oxidase that is likely involved in host defence at the colon, requires novel proteins homologous to p47phox and p67phox, designated Noxo1 and Noxa1, respectively. Molecular interaction of NADPH oxidase 1 with betaPix and Nox Organizer 1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), which is mainly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the membrane-bound component p22(PHOX) and the cytosolic partners NOX organizer 1 (NOXO1), NOX activator 1 (NOXA1), and Rac1 NOX1, an NADPH oxidase homologue that is most abundantly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the regulatory subunits NOXO1 (NOX organizing protein 1) and NOXA1 (NOX activating protein 1), as well as the flavocytochrome component p22(phox) for maximal activity Activation of the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1 requires both the organizer protein Noxo1 and the activator protein Noxa1 Activation of the non-phagocytic superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1, complexed with p22(phox) at the membrane, requires its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 and Noxa1 NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of p22(phox), Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1), Nox1 activator 1, and Rac1 UNLABELLED: Superoxide production by Nox1, a member of the Nox family NAPDH oxidases, requires expression of its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and Noxa1 (Nox activator 1) and is markedly enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC).  The p47phox- and NADPH oxidase organiser 1 (NOXO1)-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) mediates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction in a streptozotocin-induced murine model of diabetes. Studies of cytosolic co-factors showed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NOX1 was absolutely required for activation with NOXO1 and NOXA1 and that this activity required interaction of the putative NADPH-binding region of this domain with NOXA1. Nox activator 1 (NoxA1) is a homologue of p67(phox) that acts in conjunction with Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase Nox1. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and requires two cytosolic regulators, the organizer subunit NoxO1 and the activator subunit NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and it requires two cytosolic regulators, NoxO1 and NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity.

51585b28d24251bc0500008d	Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?	his defect does not appear in mouse models with mutations in Dnmt3a and Mthfr genes and, therefore, it is specific for the Dnmt1 gene and is suggestive of a role of DNMT1 in imprint resetting or maintenance in the male germ line. Specificity of Dnmt1 for methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites resides in its catalytic domain. We obtained evidence that some 5-methylcytosine residues in these single-stranded DNAs can stimulate de novo methylation of adjacent sites by murine DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase as effectively as 5-methylcytosine residues in double-stranded DNA stimulate maintenance methylation. We present in vitro evidence that the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not the maintenance enzyme DNMT1, are also redox-dependent DNA dehydroxymethylases. Direct comparison to met1 plants, deficient in maintenance methyltransferase MET1, showed higher sensitivity of ddm1 plants to NaCl. DNMT1, the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase in animals, helps to regulate gene expression, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Correct establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns at imprinted genes has been associated with placental function and regulation of embryonic/fetal development. Contributions of CTCF and DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B to Epstein-Barr virus restricted latency. Thus, differential expression of CTCF and DNMT1 and -3B is not critical for maintenance of restricted latency. Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DNMT1 to DNA replication foci, presumably through its unique hemi-methylated DNA-binding activity and interaction with DNMT1. It is generally accepted that DNA methyltransferases carry out specific and non-overlapping functions, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b being responsible for the establishment of methylation around the time of implantation and Dnmt1 ensuring that methylation is faithfully copied to daughter cells via what has come to be known as "maintenance methylation." A new model is emerging that takes into account a contribution of the de novo enzymes Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the maintenance of the DNA methylation. We propose here observations in support of the hypothesis that the maintenance of methylation and subsequent silencing of a handful of germ line genes requires Dnmt3b but not Dnmt1. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the methylation marks through cell division. However, the de novo methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, can also contribute to the maintenance of the methylation pattern. These new data support the notion that de novo DNMTs also have an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation and suggest that, in addition to acting as oncogenes, they also behave as tumor suppressors. Structural insight into maintenance methylation by mouse DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for the propagation of methylation patterns to the next generation via its preferential methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites in the genome; however, how Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns is not fully understood. Usp7 and Uhrf1 control ubiquitination and stability of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. In mammals Dnmt1 is the DNA methyltransferase chiefly responsible for maintaining genomic methylation patterns through DNA replication cycles, but how its maintenance activity is controlled is still not well understood. DMAP1 is a potent activator of DNMT1 methylation in vitro, suggesting that DMAP1 is a co-repressor that supports the maintenance and de novo action of DNMT1. A group of enzymes, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) tightly regulate both the initiation and maintenance of these methyl marks. Maintenance of DNA methylation depends on DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels, and is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). While DNMT3a is mostly involved in de novo methylation, DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase. We propose a new model that suggests that the maintenance of DNA methylation relies not only on the recognition of hemimethylated DNA by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) but also on the localization of the DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes to specific chromatin regions that contain methylated DNA. The maintenance methylase, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), is a prominent enzyme in the process that is linked to DNA replication and drives the heritable nature of epigenetic modifications. We have shown previously that these drugs selectively and rapidly induce degradation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 by a proteasomal pathway. Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). We and others have shown that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage, yet DNMT1's exact role in this process remains unclear. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. In the absence of a human pituitary tumor cell line, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the maintenance methyltransferase DNA methyltransferase (cytosine 5)-1 (Dnmt1) was used in the murine pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20. We found that DNA methylation was maintained only when exogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) were added to the reaction. We examined the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, representative of a maintenance and de novo methyltransferase respectively, in response to in-vitro depolarization of cortical neurons, using standard techniques such as high potassium (KCl) or the sodium channel agonist veratridine. DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) has a higher specific activity on hemimethylated DNA than on unmethylated DNA, but this preference is too small to explain the faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. New genetic studies in plants and mammals have identified a novel factor that increases the fidelity of maintenance methylation. Dnmt1 is the main maintenance methyltransferase in the mouse and its expression is regulated by a splicing mechanism that dictates the expression of stage-specific isoforms. Phosphorylation of serine-515 activates the Mammalian maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1. DNA methyltransferase 1 methylates hemi-methylated CG sites generated during DNA replication. DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including the maintenance enzyme DNMT 1 and de novo methyltransferases DNMT 3a and DNMT 3b. Our data suggest that DNMT1 might be essential for maintenance of DNA methylation, proliferation, and survival of cancer cells. Maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Met1) and silencing of CpG-methylated foreign DNA in Volvox carteri. DNA methylation plays an important role in the gene-silencing network of higher eukaryotes. We have analyzed the 21.5-kb maintenance methyltransferase (M-MTase) gene, met1, of the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri. DNA damage-induced down-regulation of human Cdc25C and Cdc2 is mediated by cooperation between p53 and maintenance DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1. Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance enzyme DNMT1. DNA methylation, the major form of epigenetic modifications, is catalyzed by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and/or the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites by the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is the molecular basis of the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns. The allosteric site(s) on Dnmt1 can regulate processes of de novo and maintenance DNA methylation in cells. Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome. Maintenance of genomic methylation patterns is mediated primarily by DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). In this study, we showed that DNMT1, which encodes a methylation maintenance enzyme, is a transcriptional target of BRCA1. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are essential for maintenance of aberrant methylation in cancer cells and play important roles in the development of cancers. DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1) is involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns and is crucial for normal mammalian development. DNMT1, which is important for maintenance of methylation, increased across development and stayed high in adult cortex. Our results indicate that DNMT1 plays the main role in maintenance of methylation of CXCR4 promoter, while DNMT3B may function as an accessory DNA methyltransferase to modulate CXCR4 expression in AsPC1 cells. DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained by three DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. According to their structure and functions, DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) are divided into two major families in mammalian cells: maintenance methyltransferase (Dnmt1) and de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L). The 5-LOX DNA methylation increased with the age of the cells.	['DNMT1', 'MET1']
55200c606b348bb82c000013	Which clotting factor is inhibited by betrixaban?	Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.  Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150).  They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others).  Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.   These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO-14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG1,2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. The majority of the drugs in development belong to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors (the -xabans). These include betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, and LY517717. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban.  EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa.  Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, the direct thrombin antagonist dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are more predictable and convenient anticoagulants in comparison with warfarin, mainly because of the non-requirement of regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban.  Direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxiban, which has shown promising results for VTE prophylaxis and is being studied for VTE treatment, as well as apixaban and betrixaban, which are at earlier stages of clinical validation. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation.  Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.

Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Most are small synthetic molecules that target factor IIa (e.g., dabigatran etexilate, AZD-0837) or factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, DU176b, idrabiotaparinux).

5e2e1792fbd6abf43b000024	Mutations in which gene form the genetic basis of the DOORS syndrome?	We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. More information is needed to understand the cellular roles of TBC1D24 and identify the genes responsible for DOORS phenotypes in individuals who do not have a mutation in TBC1D24.

516e5f10298dcd4e5100007c	Is cancer related to global DNA hypo or hypermethylation?	Regions of focal DNA hypermethylation and long-range hypomethylation in colorectal cancer Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation Comparison of CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation in premalignant stages of gastric cancer CpG island hypermethylation and genomic DNA hypomethylation are found not only in gastric cancers but also in associated premalignant lesions Methylation of repetitive DNA elements in gastric lesions generally decreased with progression of the gastric lesion along the multistep carcinogenesi our findings suggest that CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation are enhanced with progression of the gastric lesion DNA hypomethylation arises later in prostate cancer progression than CpG island hypermethylation Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA was one of the first somatic epigenetic alterations discovered in human cancers. DNA hypomethylation is postulated to occur very early in almost all human cancers, perhaps facilitating genetic instability and cancer initiation and progression. Contrary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all human cancers, we show that reductions in (5me)C content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a significant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease These findings provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation changes occur later in prostate carcinogenesis than the CpG island hypermethylation changes and occur heterogeneously during prostate cancer progression and metastatic dissemination. revealed a high incidence of hypermethylation only in poorly differentiated (early and late) tumors. In contrast to gene hypermethylation, genomic DNA hypomethylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive elements and loss of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, occurred in both early and late stages of prostate cancer. Tumors have reduced levels of genomic DNA methylation and contain hypermethylated CpG islands The results are consistent with a specific defect in methylation of repetitive DNA sequences in human cancer. Both hypomethylation and hypermethylation in a 0.2-kb region of a DNA repeat in cancer Differential DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation signatures in colorectal cancer Cancer cells are characterized by a generalized disruption of the DNA methylation pattern involving an overall decrease in the level of 5-methylcytosine together with regional hypermethylation of particular CpG islands We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression	['Global hypomethylation is coupled with focal hypermethylation at CpG islands']

6030fcb51cb411341a000127	Which database exists that contains regulatory sites for splicing in human basal ganglia?	Regulatory sites for splicing in human basal ganglia are enriched for disease-relevant information. Genome-wide association studies have generated an increasing number of common genetic variants associated with neurological and psychiatric disease risk. An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants. However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) signals. We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease.

Although the affected protein ataxin-3 is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding ataxin-3 Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiqutinating enzyme with important functions in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway and regulation of transcription. The C-terminus of the ataxin-3 protein contains a polyglutamine (PolyQ) region that, when mutationally expanded to over 52 glutamines, causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 Ataxin-3, the disease protein in the neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 or Machado Joseph disease, is a cysteine protease implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to the C-terminus exceeds a critical length Here, in studies of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. This pathogenic repeat in MJD/SCA3 encodes an expanded tract of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein, which is known as ataxin-3. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is caused by mutant ataxin-3 with a polyglutamine expansion.  Mutant ataxin-3 is aberrantly folded and proteolytically cleaved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The C-terminal region of the protein includes a polyglutamine stretch that is expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

58f89eb270f9fc6f0f00001a	What is the genetic basis of Ohdo syndrome?	Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c.3443G>A [p.Arg1148His] or c.3493T>C [p.Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified. Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c.5185C>A [p.His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected. The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome. FG syndrome, Lujan syndrome, and Ohdo syndrome, the Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, have been described as distinct syndromes with overlapping non-specific features and different missense mutations of the MED12 gene have been reported in all of them. Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.  To date, these conditions include Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) syndrome, Lujan syndrome, Ohdo syndrome (Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, or OSMKB), and one large family with profound X-linked intellectual disability due to a novel c.5898insC frameshift mutation that unlike the other three syndromes, resulted in affected female carriers and truncation of the MED12 protein.  This case lends credence to the evolving theory that the subtypes of Ohdo, and perhaps other MED12 disorders, reflect a spectrum of characteristics, rather than distinct syndromes. MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels. Finally, direct sequencing of MED12, the gene mutated in Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome and X-linked Ohdo syndrome identified in the two sibs the missense mutation c.3443G>A (p.Arg1148His) inherited from the mother. Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome. Beyond Ohdo syndrome: A familial missense mutation broadens the MED12 spectrum.	['mutations in MED12']

58dfe6b56fddd3e83e000004	What is the enzymatic activity of PARL?	Here we demonstrate that the mitochondrial protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like (PARL) can affect the proteolytic processing of PINK1 and that normal PINK1 localization and stability requires PARL's catalytic activity.  The mitochondrial rhomboid protease Parl governs apoptosis, morphology, metabolism and might be implicated in Parkinson's disease, but the structural basis of its activity and complex regulation remain unknown. . In this study, we evaluated the mRNA levels of presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL) and mitochondrial content and enzyme activity from skeletal muscle isolated from insulin-resistant rats. Rhomboids are a recently discovered family of widely distributed intramembrane serine proteases. 	['PARL are serine proteases']

58e75d483e8b6dc87c000005	Which gene controls the expression of GATA-1 isoforms?	Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.  This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation. Novel combinatorial interactions of GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms regulate transcription of the gene encoding eosinophil granule major basic protein. Furthermore, we observe that in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver cells, low levels of the IE GATA-1 isoform is expressed, but the variant IB isoform is absent. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27)..

Diaskintest® test and Mantoux test with 2TE PPD-L were concurrently carried out in 300 children and adolescents with tuberculosis and followed up in risk groups at a tuberculosis dispensary to determine the sensitivity of the new skin test in active tuberculosis infection. Latent tuberculosis treatment was recommended in all Mantoux-positive contacts. The prevalence of tuberculosis infection among hospitalized patients in a pneumological department of an inner-city hospital was evaluated, using the intradermal tuberculin skin test (Mantoux technique).  he 100-year-old tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) has been the only available diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection, despite its many well-known limitations. In order to determine the prevalence of latent infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in drug users and to provide centres for drug users with a practical tool for tuberculosis screening, 237 drug users were subjected to the Monotest and, for reference purposes, to the Mantoux test.

58a5b1fe60087bc10a000024	What is the role of the UBC9 enzyme in the protein sumoylation pathway?	Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation.  We also found a marked rise in levels of Ubc9, the only SUMO conjugation enzyme identified so far.  Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways. We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation.  The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) is an important conjunction enzyme in the SUMO pathway.  Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), Ubc9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF-1α, augmented sumoylation of HIF-1α, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death.  Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation. UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway. Here we have identified host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC9, a SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity. The SUMO pathway parallels the classical ubiquitinylation pathway with three discrete steps: activation involving the enzyme E1, conjugation involving the E2 enzyme UBC9, and substrate modification through the cooperative association of UBC9 and E3 ligases. RAP80 interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 and is a novel target for sumoylation. Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation. Although there are multiple E2 enzymes required for ubiquitination, there is only one E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, which is Ubc9. Consistent with a role of sumoylation in inhibiting Tec1 activity, specifically increasing sumoylation of Tec1 by fusing it to the sumoylating enzyme Ubc9 leads to a dramatic decrease of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Ubc9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and has been implicated in regulating several critical cellular pathways. We also exposed placental explants to hypoxia to study the effect on the SUMOylation pathway.We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation It has been reported that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the unique enzyme2 in the sumoylation pathway, is up-regulated in many cancers Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity Here, we investigated inhibition of sumoylation as a novel antifibrotic approach.Sumoylation was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMO) E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which is essential for sumoylation Here we have identified host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC9, a SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein A new pathway that contributes to mutant CFTR degradation is mediated by the small heat shock protein, Hsp27, which cooperates with Ubc9, the E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, to selectively conjugate mutant CFTR with SUMO-2/3 Using transfection of Ets-1 wildtype (WT) or its sumoylation deficient version (Ets-1 K15R/K227R), as well as WT or mutant proteins of the SUMO pathway, we further demonstrated that the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and a E3 SUMO ligase, PIASy, can enhance Ets-1 sumoylation, while a SUMO protease, SENP1, can desumoylate Ets-1 The results show that basal SUMO modification is required for stimuli-induced p100 phosphorylation and that blocking SUMOylation of p100, either by site-directed mutation or by short interfering RNA-targeted diminution of E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, inhibits various physiological stimuli-induced p100 processing and ultimate activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway Sumoylation proceeds via an enzymatic pathway that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination, but requires a different E1-activating enzyme and Ubc9, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 UBC9 mediates viral immediate-early protein SUMOylation in crayfish to facilitate reproduction of white spot syndrome virus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), a small ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme, in cardiomyocyte protein quality control.  Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme             9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function             and plays a key role in tumorigenesis.  UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway. Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity. Sumoylation proceeds via an enzymatic pathway that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination, but requires a different E1-activating enzyme and Ubc9, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme. Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), Ubc9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF-1α, augmented sumoylation of HIF-1α, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. In this study, we revisited the role of Tax SUMOylation using a strategy based on the targeting of Ubc9, the unique E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for regulated sumoylation as a mechanism to modulate the activity of Tec1 and validate Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation as a useful approach for studying protein sumoylation. We report that the high risk HPVE6 proteins reduce the intracellular quantity of the sole SUMO conjugation enzyme, Ubc9, concomitant with decreased host sumoylation. We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation. As the sole E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, Ubc9 is predominantly nuclear. Expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) molecules, SUMO E1 activating enzymes SAE1 and SAE2, SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9, and de-sumoylation enzyme sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENP)1 was immunolocalized in rat intervertebral disc (IVD) cells.

Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid.  topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral linezolid in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions and impetigo due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  To evaluate the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral linezolid in the treatment of patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions (SITLs; excluding abscesses) or impetigo due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivative being developed as a topical antibiotic for treating bacterial infections of the skin. OBJECTIVES: Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. Retapamulin appears to be a much needed antimicrobial option for treating the AD population due to their common carriage of bacterial pathogens and frequency of infectious complications. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. Retapamulin: what is the role of this topical antimicrobial in the treatment of bacterial infections in atopic dermatitis? In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years.

Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Discovery of AG-120 (Ivosidenib): A First-in-Class Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of IDH1 Mutant Cancers. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo.   Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. A phase I study suggests that ivosidenib can induce remission in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia characterized by IDH1 mutations. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). The FDA approved ivosidenib for patients with IDH1-mutant relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.  Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®) is a small molecule, orally available inhibitor of mutated cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that is being developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer in patients with IDH1 mutations.

58ea7248eda5a57672000002	What is the phenotype of people carrying mutations in the gene PRDM12?	The evolutionarily conserved transcription factor PRDM12 controls sensory neuron development and pain perception. Here we show that PRDM12 is a key regulator of sensory neuronal specification in Xenopus. Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception.  New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis.   However, the study of genetic disorders rendering individuals completely unable to feel pain offers hope. All causes of congenital painlessness affect nociceptors, evolutionarily conserved specialist neurons able to sense all type of tissue damage. The discovery of new genes essential for sensing pain (SCN11A, PRDM12, and CLTCL1) has provided unexpected insights into the biological mechanisms that drive distinct stages of nociception.

5c55d9b707647bbc4b000009	Which molecule is targeted by Caplacizumab?	Caplacizumab, a nanobody that blocks the interaction between VWF and platelets, has shown promising results in decreasing the time to recover from the acute events that will hopefully translate into long-term clinical benefit for patients. Ablynx, a Sanofi Company, has developed the anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® caplacizumab (Cablivi™) for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). Promising agents under evaluation include N-acetylcysteine, bortezomib, recombinant ADAMTS13 and caplacizumab, an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-von Willebrand factor axis. The most promising candidates for future treatment of TTP are: rituximab for termination of the autoimmune process, caplacizumab for prevention of platelet-VWF-interaction, and recombinant ADAMTS13 for replacement of the inhibited or missing enzyme. Promising agents under evaluation include caplacizumab (an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-Von-Willebrand factor axis), N-acetylcysteine, recombinant ADAMTS13, and anti-plasmocyte compounds.  In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody® was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. It is now anticipated that the first VHH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter.

5d35ee08b3a6380763000012	Which epigenetic marks are deposited by PRC1?	 In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA.  When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). PRC2 induces histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is subsequently read by PRC1 that further catalyzes H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), creating a transcriptional silent chromatin conformation.  Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. For a long time, the PcG mechanism has been proposed to follow a hierarchical recruitment of PcG repressive complexes (PRCs) to target genes in which the binding of PRC2 and the incorporation of H3 lysine 27 trimethyl marks led to recruitment of PRC1, which in turn mediated H2A monoubiquitination. Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. Ho Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer.

53357193d6d3ac6a34000047	Which JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis?	Tofacitinib: The First Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Preclinical to clinical translation of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in rheumatoid arthritis. The preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis (mCIA) model was compared with clinical PK/PD data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). With tofacitinib, the first Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor has been approved in the USA, as well as in Switzerland and other countries.  Tofacitinib, which is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has shown clinical effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis.   In patients treated with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, RR for hypercholesterolaemia was 1.70 (1.10 to 2.63) that was dose related.  After two decades of research and development activity focussed on orally active kinase inhibitors, the first such drug (the JAK inhibitor Xeljanz, tofacitinib) was approved by the FDA in November 2012 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  JAK inhibitor tofacitinib for treating rheumatoid arthritis: from basic to clinical. An orally available JAK3 inhibitor, tofacitinib, has been applied for RA, with satisfactory effects and acceptable safety in multiple clinical examinations.  Subsequently, multiple phase 3 studies were carried out, and tofacitinib with or without methotrexate (MTX) is efficacious and has a manageable safety profile in active RA patients who are MTX naïve or show inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-IR, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor-IR. Taken together, an orally available kinase inhibitor tofacitinib targeting JAK-mediated signals would be expected to be a new option for RA treatment. A non-selective JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, has recently been approved to treat myelofibrosis whereas tofacitinib is poised for approval to treat rheumatoid arthritis.  The recent disclosure of the clinical efficacy of a selective JAK1 inhibitor (GLPG-0634) in rheumatoid arthritis and detailed disclosure of the some potent and highly selective JAK1 inhibitors provide a clear stimulus for further activity in this area.  These results suggest that the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib suppresses osteoclast-mediated structural damage to arthritic joints, and this effect is secondary to decreased RANKL production. More recently, the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib has been evaluated as a potential new treatment option in RA and is awaiting approval. A total of 140 patients were randomised to tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10 mg or placebo twice daily and the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12, a primary end point, was significant for all tofacitinib treatment groups. Thus, an orally available tofacitinib in combination with MTX was efficacious and had a manageable safety profile. Tofacitinib at 5 and 10 mg twice a day appears suitable for further evaluation to optimise the treatment of RA. Moreover, induction of IL-10 production by DCs can be one mechanism of action of the JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) which have shown high efficiency on active rheumatoid arthritis in clinical trials. Recently, CP-690,550 (tofacitinib), originally developed as a JAK3 inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in phase III clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models, but the precise mechanism of the effect, especially with respect to Th17 cells, is poorly understood.   Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a novel JAK inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 6 dosages of oral tofacitinib (CP-690,550) with placebo for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients receiving a stable background regimen of methotrexate (MTX) who have an inadequate response to MTX monotherapy.  In patients with active RA in whom the response to MTX has been inadequate, the addition of tofacitinib at a dosage ≥3 mg twice daily showed sustained efficacy and a manageable safety profile over 24 weeks. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 5 doses of oral tofacitinib (CP-690,550) or adalimumab monotherapy with placebo for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Tofacitinib monotherapy at ≥3 mg twice a day was efficacious in the treatment of patients with active RA over 24 weeks and demonstrated a manageable safety profile. The new JAK3 inhibitor, CP690,550, has shown efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. CP-690,550 is a potent and selective JAK inhibitor currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune disease indications. Co-administration of the JAK inhibitor CP-690,550 and methotrexate is well tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis without need for dose adjustment. To investigate the effects of methotrexate (MTX) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CP-690,550, a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in development as a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to determine the effects of multiple doses of CP-690,550 on the PK of MTX, and to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of co-administration of CP-690,550 and MTX.  Improved pain, physical functioning and health status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with CP-690,550, an orally active Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor: results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. CP-690,550 was efficacious in improving the pain, function and health status of patients with RA, from week 1 to week 6. Our findings indicate that CP-690,550 is efficacious in the treatment of RA, resulting in rapid, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful reductions in the signs and symptoms of RA. INCB18424 targeting Jak1/2 and CP690,550 targeting Jak3 has been developed and is now on phase II clinical study for RA.	['tofacitinib']

Caring for a patient with rabies: implications of the Milwaukee protocol for infection control and public health measures. The Milwaukee protocol, which to date has five reported human rabies survivors associated with its use, has been suggested as a potential management pathway for human rabies.  Critical Appraisal of the Milwaukee Protocol for Rabies: This Failed Approach Should Be Abandoned. Therapies suggested in the Milwaukee protocol include therapeutic coma, ketamine infusion, amantadine, and the screening/prophylaxis/management of cerebral vasospasm. None of these therapies can be substantiated in rabies or other forms of acute viral encephalitis. The Milwaukee protocol has been attributed to survival in rabies encephalitis despite a lack of scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic measures.  Rabies is virtually always fatal after clinical disease develops, and there have only been rare survivors. The Milwaukee protocol, which includes therapeutic coma, has been shown to be ineffective and should no longer be used. The Milwaukee Protocol has proved to be ineffective for rabies and should no longer be used.

5325fdf0600967d132000001	What is the gold standard treatment for Iatrogenic male incontinence?	The initial treatment for SUI that persists after 12 months consists of conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and behavioral therapy. Properly selected and informed patients can also be treated efficiently with minimally invasive procedures such as the implantation of a male suburethral sling, although the experience with such devices is not extensive. However, the implantation of artificial urinary sphincter is the gold standard therapy. treatments such as periurethral injection of bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation, and sub-urethral sling positioning. The artificial urethral sphincter has represented, until today, the gold standard but, in the recent years, sling systems have been investigated as minimally invasive alternative options. Today, three different sling procedures are commonly performed: bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems. The bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling is a simple and attractive procedure that can produce immediate good results with low morbidity, especially when strictly selected patients are treated.  BAUS implantation is a safe, effective, minimally invasive option for iatrogenic male incontinence due to ISD. It compares favourably with AUS.	['Artificial urethral sphincter', 'AUS']

As novel molecules, microRNAs (miRs) take part in regulating protein-coding gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) regulation in tumorigenesis  MiRs are small (~23 nt) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by specifically interacting with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target gene mRNA to repress translation or enhance mRNA cleavage.  The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) has opened an entire new avenue for drug development. These short (15-22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs, which function in RNA silencing and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, have been shown to critically affect numerous pathways in both development and disease progression.

Filgotinib (GLPG0634) is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) currently in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.  Clinical Confirmation that the Selective JAK1 Inhibitor Filgotinib (GLPG0634) has a Low Liability for Drug-drug Interactions. The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing.   In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug transporters. In the clinic, a lack of relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions by filgotinib and its active metabolite with substrates of CYP3A4, as well as with organic anion transporters involved in methotrexate elimination were found. Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies. Here we review the pharmacology and clinical trial data for efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an investigational selective JAK1 inhibitor.

56d1da3b67f0cb3d66000006	How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates?	Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.

56c04412ef6e39474100001b	Which molecule is targeted by Daratumumab?	Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma.  Daratumumab is a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human monoclonal antibody against unique CD38 epitope with broad-spectrum killing activity. This review focuses on the CD38 antigen and its targeting with daratumumab and provides an update on the results of recent clinical studies involving daratumumab. BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells.  CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs.  Here, we describe that treatment of multiple myeloma patients with daratumumab, a novel anti-CD38 MoAb, resulted in false-positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs) for all patients for 2 to 6 months after infusion.  Interference of daratumumab and three other anti-CD38 MoAbs was studied using fresh-frozen plasma spiked with different MoAb concentrations. Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human monoclonal antibody against unique CD38 epitope with broad-spectrum killing activity.

In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in CD38-expressing lymphoma- and MM-derived cell lines as well as in patient MM cells, both with autologous and allogeneic effector cells.  Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient MM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were not affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenvironment. In vivo, daratumumab was highly active and interrupted xenograft tumor growth at low dosing.

56c1f010ef6e394741000041	Simpson grading is used to describe resection of which brain tumor?	The impact of age (≤ 70 vs.>70 years), sex, tumor diameter (<6 vs. ≥ 6 cm), pre- and postoperative KPS (<80 vs. ≥ 80), Simpson grade (I-II vs. III-IV), and World Health Organization (WHO) histologic grade (I vs. II-III) on survival was assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and differences in survival between groups of patients were compared. A multivariate analysis adjusted for age, pre- and postoperative KPS, Simpson grade, tumor diameter, and WHO histologic grade also was performed.RESULTS: The fronto-orbito-basal approach (n = 22) allowed a significantly greater percentage of Simpson I-II removals than the bifrontal (n = 70) and pterional approach (n = 21) (P = 0.0354 and P = 0.0485, respectively).  Simpson Grade I-III Resection of Spinal Atypical (World Health Organization Grade II) Meningiomas is Associated With Symptom Resolution and Low Recurrence. Simpson grade I, II, III, and IV resection were achieved in 3 (15%), 13 (65%), 2 (10%), and 2 (10%) tumors, respectively. One patient that underwent Simpson grade III resection received adjuvant radiation therapy. After Simpson grade I-III or gross total resection, no tumors recurred (0%; confidence interval, 0%-17.6%). After Simpson grade IV resection, 1 tumor recurred (50%; confidence interval, 1.3%-98.7%).   The Simpson grading system was used to assess the extent of surgical resection. Simpson grade: an opportunity to reassess the need for complete resection of meningiomas. BACKGROUND: The relevance of the Simpson grading system as a predictor of meningioma progression or recurrence in modern neurosurgical practice has recently been called into question. The aim of our study was to compare the risk of progression/recurrence of tumours that had been treated with different Simpson grade resections in a contemporary population of benign (WHO grade I) meningioma patients. RESULTS: The three-year progression/recurrence-free survival rates for patients receiving Simpson grade 1, 2 or 4 resections were 95 %, 87 % and 67 %, respectively. Simpson grade 4 resections progressed/recurred at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.26, P = 0.04), whereas Simpson grade 2 resections did not progress/recur at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (HR = 1.78, P = 0.29). Effect of dural detachment on long-term tumor control for meningiomas treated using Simpson grade IV resection. The Simpson grading system classifies incomplete resections into a single category, namely Simpson Grade IV, with wide variations in the volume and location of residual tumors, making it complicated to evaluate the achievement of surgical goals and predict the prognosis of these tumors. Authors of the present study investigated the factors related to necessity of retreatment and tried to identify any surgical nuances achievable with the aid of modern neurosurgical techniques for meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection.METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients with WHO Grade I meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection as the initial therapy at the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 1995 and April 2010.  Stereotactic radiosurgery provides equivalent tumor control to Simpson Grade 1 resection for patients with small- to medium-size meningiomas. Multivariate analysis revealed that no dural detachment (hazard ratio [HR]6.42, 95% CI 1.41-45.0; p = 0.02) and skull base location (HR 11.6, 95% CI 2.18-218; p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for the necessity of early retreatment, whereas postresection tumor volume of 4 cm(3) or more was not a statistically significant risk factor.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Simpson Grade I, II, and III resections, Simpson Grade IV resection includes highly heterogeneous tumors in terms of resection rate and location of the residual mass. Despite the difficulty in analyzing such diverse data, these results draw attention to the favorable effect of dural detachment (instead of maximizing the resection rate) on long-term tumor control. Surgical strategy with an emphasis on detaching the tumor from the affected dura might be another important option in resection of high-risk meningiomas not amenable to gross-total resection. The relevance of Simpson Grade I and II resection in modern neurosurgical treatment of World Health Organization Grade I meningiomas. Surgery for convexity meningioma: Simpson Grade I resection as the goal: clinical article. However, for skull base meningiomas, in which mostly Simpson Grade II resection is achieved, the use of this classification should be further validated. 	['meningioma']

5a68f005b750ff4455000016	Which personality disorder is treated using dialectical behavior therapy?	Neural correlates of distraction in borderline personality disorder before and after dialectical behavior therapy. It is unknown whether neural correlates of emotion regulation change after a psychotherapy which has the goal to improve emotion dysregulation in BPD, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).  In conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after DBT in patients with BPD. ObjectiveInvestigate influence and change of self-directedness (SD) in Dialectical-Behavior Therapy (DBT) for 26 female outpatients with borderline personality disorder (BPS). ConclusionDBT strengthens the SD of patients with BPD. OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment with efficacy in reducing self-harm behaviors in borderline personality disorder (BPD).  CONCLUSION: This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training. Exploring the effectiveness of combined mentalization-based group therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy for inpatients with borderline personality disorder - A pilot study. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation, whereby problems concerning social cognition, which are also characteristic of BPD, may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT). Pain-mediated affect regulation is reduced after dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a longitudinal fMRI study. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an emotion-regulating effect. We investigated whether pain-mediated affect regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation techniques.  Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency. Of evaluated psychological treatments in borderline personality disorder, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the strongest research support, followed by mentalization based therapy (MBT). The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed by Marsha Linehan (1991) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but because of the core deficits in emotion regulation in disruptive behavior disorders, DBT is also increasingly being recommended for the treatment of CD and APD. Treatment of suicidal and deliberate self-harming patients with borderline personality disorder using dialectical behavioral therapy: the patients' and the therapists' perceptions. Dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy also caused a soaring remission rate of diagnostic borderline personality disorder criteria of 57% and 94%, respectively. OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for outpatients with borderline personality disorder. OBJECTIVE The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that dialectical behavior therapy is a promising psychosocial intervention for improving interpersonal functioning among severely dysfunctional patients with borderline personality disorder. A central component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the teaching of specific behavioral skills with the aim of helping individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) replace maladaptive behaviors with skillful behavior. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally designed as a treatment of emotionally dysregulated, impulsive, and dramatic disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder) and populations (e.g., parasuicidal women). Dialectical behavior therapy, an outpatient psychosocial treatment for chronically suicidal women with borderline personality disorder, has been adapted for use in a partial hospital program for women. OBJECTIVE At present, the most frequently investigated psychosocial intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients. Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency. These results suggest that individuals with borderline personality disorder benefited equally from dialectical behavior therapy and a well-specified treatment delivered by psychiatrists with expertise in the treatment of borderline personality disorder..

5abc9ecffcf4565872000021	Where do mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints tend to occur?	n this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the "Pattern Finder" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. Direct repeat sequences are not required at the breakpoints of age-associated mitochondrial DNA deletions in rhesus monkeys. Most of the analyzed deletion breakpoints showed nucleotide repeats flanking the deletions.  Currently, the multiple types of GQ sequences and their association with human mtDNA stability are unknown.<br><b>RESULTS</b>: Here, we show an association between human mtDNA deletion breakpoint locations (sites where DNA ends rejoin after deletion of a section) and sequences with G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP), and establish the ability of selected sequences to form GQ in vitro. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. DNA sequences proximal to human mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplexes, a class of DNA structures inefficiently unwound by the mitochondrial replicative Twinkle helicase.

58ee0dd5eda5a57672000013	From which cell type is leptin secreted?	 Although leptin is produced mainly by white adipose tissue, several laboratories have shown low levels of leptin production by a growing number of tissues including the anterior pituitary gland. Lipolysis (stimulated by beta-adrenergic agents) and leptin secretion by adipocytes are down-regulated by neurons in coculture, effects apparently mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) Leptin is mainly produced and secreted by adipocytes, but other tissues and gastric glands have also recently been shown to produce it in a dual (endocrine and exocrine) mode. Leptin was also detected in some microglobules in whole saliva obtained from four healthy volunteers. Co-localization for leptin, leptin receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the same cell type suggested a functional relationship between glucocorticoid hormone and leptin secretion also at the level of the salivary glands. Leptin, a circulating hormone secreted mainly from adipose tissues, possesses protective effects on many cell types. Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone that regulates weight, is known to link lipid metabolism with inflammation in various cell types Leptin, a 16-kDa protein that is mainly secreted by adipocytes, plays a protective role in many cell types Do the adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin affect the granulosa cell expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and its receptor (AMHR-II)?Leptin suppresses AMH mRNA levels in human luteinized granulosa cells through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, while adiponectin has no such effect.AMH is one of the most reliable markers of ovarian reserve Leptin, the adipocyte-secreted hormone, exerts its main function as regulator of food intake and energy expenditure through central effects at the hypothalamic level. Adipokines are a group of fat-secreted hormones and cytokines, including leptin and adiponectin, with important functions in humans. Leptin, an adipose-secreted hormone, links metabolism and immunity. Since the discovery of leptin secreted from adipocytes, specialized tissues and cells have been found that secrete the several peptides (or cytokines) that are characterized to negatively and positively regulate the metabolic process. Adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) secreted from adipose tissue have come to be recognized for their contribution to the mechanisms by which obesity and related metabolic disorders influence breast cancer risk. These results show that there is a distinct female-type and male-type leptin pulsatility pattern and each is amenable to augmentation by gonadal steroids either involving mechanisms that impart leptin pulsatility patterns directly at the level of adipocytes and/or at hypothalamic target sites.. Leptin is a circulating hormone secreted by adipose and a few other tissues. Cyclin D1 is expressed exclusively in luminal keratin 8 immunoreactive tumor cells and is dependent on the adipose secreted hormone leptin. In gastric cells leptin follows a rapid regulated secretion pathway whereas adipocytes secrete leptin in a constitutive slow fashion.	['adipocytes']
5519110f622b19434500000c	Which disease is included as an additional feature in the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome?	Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS, MIM #609460) is an autosomal recessive disorder of intellectual disability, specific facial gestalt and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) is a rare clinical disorder characterized by central and enteric nervous system defects. Thus, our data indicate that KBP is involved in neuronal differentiation and that the central and enteric nervous system defects seen in GOSHS are likely caused by microtubule-related defects. Mutations in Kif1-binding protein/KIAA1279 (KBP) cause the devastating neurological disorder Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GSS) in humans. We describe a brother and sister with Hirschsprung disease, hypotonia, and ptosis. Their condition resembles that in 2 sibs reported by Goldberg and Shprintzen. A 5-year-old girl with Hirschsprung disease, unusual facial appearance, psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and congenital heart disease is reported Cranial computed tomography demonstrated abnormal findings that may suggest defective neuronal migration and/or dysgenesis of the brain In 1981, Goldberg and Shprintzen described siblings with short-segment Hirschsprung disease, cleft palate, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, short stature and distinctive facial appearance. A consanguineous family with Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and mental retardation (Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome) Hirschsprung disease, mental retardation, microcephaly, and specific craniofacial dysmorphism were observed in three children from a large, consanguineous, Moroccan family The patient showed dysmorphic facies and weakness of connective tissue, and was scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm. We report on maternal half-sibs born to unaffected, non-consanguineous parents with classical Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) who had in addition intestinal malrotation and an aberrant subclavian artery keletal abnormalities common to 3 of them include bowing of long bones (with a variable degree of progression over time), flare of the metaphyses, a large anterior fontanel with persistent patency into the second to fourth years of life, 13 pairs of ribs, distinct vertebral abnormalities which were absent neonatally but evolved by the second year of life, and progressive osteopenia. Marfanoid phenotype with craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome) is a rare disorder previously described in only 5 patients. Mutation in fibrillin-1 and the Marfanoid-craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg) syndrome Additional common findings include other craniofacial anomalies, hypotonia, obstructive apnea, foot deformity, and congenital weakness of the abdominal wall  The radiological features were characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches Aortic root replacement for annuloaortic ectasia in Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome: a case report Annuloaortic ectasia due to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is reported Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is an extremely rare syndrome with a characteristic face. This is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid features. The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising craniosynostosis, a marfanoid habitus and skeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, and connective-tissue anomalies. Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period, developmental delay, and inguinal or umbilical hernia.  Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by marfanoid habitus and additional dysmorphic stigmata. Overall intelligibility, language, articulation, voice and resonance characteristics in a child with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a rare disorder characterized by a Marfan-like habitus, mental retardation and craniosynostosis.  Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by: craniosynostosis of the coronal, sagittal, or lambdoid sutures; dolichocephaly; distinctive craniofacial features; skeletal changes (dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, pes planus, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis, joint hypermobility or contractures and C1/C2 spine malformation); neurologic abnormalities; intellectual disability; and brain anomalies (hydrocephalus, dilatation of the lateral ventricles, and Chiari 1 malformation). Cardiovascular anomalies may include mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation/incompetence, aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation. Minimal subcutaneous fat, abdominal wall defects, myopia, and cryptorchidism in males, are also characteristic findings. Surgical treatment for scoliosis in patients with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus. We identified, by homozygosity mapping, a novel locus on 10q21.3-q22.1 for Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) in a consanguineous Moroccan family. Phenotypic features of GOSHS in this inbred family included microcephaly and mental retardation, which are both central nervous system defects, as well as Hirschsprung disease, an enteric nervous system defect We demonstrate that homozygous nonsense mutations in KIAA1279 at 10q22.1, encoding a protein with two tetratrico peptide repeats, underlie this syndromic form of Hirschsprung disease and generalized polymicrogyria, establishing the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system development We report on four children in whom was diagnosed a neurocristopathy, associating Hirschsprung's disease with a wide spectrum of neurologic abnormalities. The patients included two children presenting the phenotypic features of the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome: distinct dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and mental retardation, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cortical malformations associated with intractable seizures in one child. The third newborn presented with the Haddad syndrome: short-segment Hirschsprung's disease associated with the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome requiring permanent artificial ventilation Therefore, awareness of a possible neurocristopathy associated with neurologic abnormalities should be taken into account in any patient newly diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease to detect the abnormalities early and promptly manage them	['Craniosynostosis']

511a3573df1ebcce7d000018	How many tissue kallikrein genes are present in the human genome?	Tissue kallikreins are a group of closely related serine proteinases that are represented by multigene families in mice and rats. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. The human tissue Kallikrein family consists of 15 genes with the majority shown to be differentially expressed in cancers and/or indicators of cancer prognosis. The 15 members of the kallikrein-related serine peptidase (KLK) family have diverse tissue-specific expression profiles and putative proteolytic functions. The 15 human and 24 mouse kallikreins have been implicated in pathophysiology of brain, kidney, and respiratory and reproductive systems and often are used as cancer biomarkers. Kallikrein gene families have been identified previously in genomes of the human, the mouse, and the rat, and individual kallikrein-like genes have been found in many more species. The human tissue kallikrein family of serine proteases (hK1-hK15 encoded by the genes KLK1-KLK15) is involved in several cancer-related processes. The tissue kallikrein gene family consists of 15 genes tandemly arranged on human chromosome 19q13.4. Human kallikreins are a cluster of 15 serine protease genes located in the chromosomal band 19q13.4, a non-randomly rearranged region in many solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer. Tissue kallikrein genes (KLKs) are found on chromosome 19q13.3-4 as a gene cluster encoding 15 different serine proteases. Project to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human KLK genes in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues and cell lines. Novel kallikrein genes were cloned recently, and it was shown that the human kallikrein family contains 15 genes tandemly aligned on chromosomal locus 19q13.3-q13.4. The human kallikrein gene family consists of 15 serine proteases. We have recently characterized the human kallikrein gene locus on chromosome 19q13.4, which includes 15 kallikrein genes.

56d1f790f22319765a000001	Which gene harbors the mutation T790M?	Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20.  Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse.  Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M. However, resistance to the EGFR TKIs develops mostly secondary to T790M mutation in exon 20.  The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the threonine(790)-methionine(790) (T790M) point mutation of EGFR kinase is one of the leading causes of acquired resistance to the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib Both AKT and MEK inhibition contributed to cell death independent of erlotinib in the T790M-containing H1975 and the EGFR-WT cell lines tested.  The EGFR T790M mutation is generally considered to be the molecular genetic basis of acquired TKI resistance Prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI: poorer prognosis associated with T790M-negative status and leptomeningeal metastases.

5e36a718b5b409ea53000004	Which T-UCR has been implicated in prostate cancer?	Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. Docetaxel is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, nearly all patients ultimately become refractory due to the development of docetaxel resistance. The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC.

516e5f41298dcd4e5100007f	What is the genetic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome?	The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a well-defined syndrome with facial abnormalities, broad thumbs, broad big toes and mental retardation as the main clinical features Many patients with RTS have been shown to have breakpoints in, and microdeletions of, chromosome 16p13.3 these breakpoints are restricted to a region that contains the gene for the human CREB binding protein (CBP), a nuclear protein participating as a co-activator in cyclic-AMP-regulated gene expression RTS was shown to be associated with disruption of the CREB-binding protein gene CBP (CREBBP), either by gross chromosomal rearrangements or by point mutations Genetic heterogeneity in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome: mutations in both the CBP and EP300 genes cause disease A certain level of CREB-binding protein is essential for normal development, since inactivation of one allele causes Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) In 92 patients, we were able to identify a total of 36 mutations in CBP We extended the search for mutations to the EP300 gene and showed that mutations in EP300 also cause this disorder. Mutations in the CREBBP (CREB-binding protein gene) cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). Heterozygous CREBBP mutations were identified in 12 of the 21 patients: five frameshift mutations, three nonsense mutations, two splice-site mutations, and two missense mutations.

We identified MDM two binding protein (MTBP) as a factor that interacts with Treslin/TICRR throughout the cell cycle. We show that MTBP depletion by means of small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication by preventing assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) holohelicase during origin firing. Although MTBP has been implicated in the function of the p53 tumor suppressor, we found MTBP is required for DNA replication irrespective of a cell's p53 status. We propose that MTBP acts with Treslin/TICRR to integrate signals from cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways to control the initiation of DNA replication in human cells. We identified MDM two binding protein (MTBP) as a factor that interacts with Treslin/TICRR throughout the cell cycle Treslin/TICRR (TopBP1-interacting, replication stimulating protein/TopBP1-interacting, checkpoint, and replication regulator), the human ortholog of the yeast Sld3 protein, is an essential DNA replication factor that is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases and the DNA damage checkpoint.

With Idarucizumab and Andexanet Alfa, specific antidotes have been developed against both, direct thrombin inhibitors as well as direct Factor Xa inhibitors.  Three novel molecules (idarucizumab, andexanet, and PER977) may provide the most effective and safest way of reversal.  Idarucizumab Improves Outcome in Murine Brain Hemorrhage Related to Dabigatran. We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab.  Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality. BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial. INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing.  Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal.

54e0c3e71388e8454a000013	Which enzyme is inhibited by Orteronel?	PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. The drug orteronel selectively blocked the lyase reaction of P450 17A1 but only in the case of Prog.  Preclinical assessment of Orteronel(®), a CYP17A1 enzyme inhibitor in rats. Orteronel (TAK-700) is a novel and selective inhibitor of CYP17A1, which is expressed in testicular, adrenal and prostate tumor tissues. Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase that was recently in phase 3 clinical development as a treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whereas orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50  > 100 µm). PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, nonsteroidal, oral, inhibitor of androgen synthesis with greater specificity for 17,20-lyase than for 17α-hydroxylase. Based on these observations, potent agents targeting the AR axis were developed: 1) inhibitors of CYP17 (a key enzyme in the production of androgens), such as abiraterone and orteronel; 2) AR antagonists that bind to AR and impair AR activation, such as enzalutamide and ARN-509.  Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells.  Inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase by abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), providing a rationale for development of CYP17 inhibitors with increased specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and VT-464) that can potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids. Phase I/II trial of orteronel (TAK-700)--an investigational 17,20-lyase inhibitor--in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones.  Hence, some molecules target the androgen biosynthesis, as abiraterone acetate and orteronel, which are selective inhibitors of the enzyme CYP17. To achieve enhanced clinical benefits, new strategies are being explored that include selective inhibition of the C17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 and multi-targeting strategies that affect androgen synthesis and signalling at different points. Some of these strategies-including the drugs orteronel, VT-464 and galeterone--are supported by preclinical data and are being explored in the clinic. Besides further CYP17 inhibitors (Orteronel, Galeterone, VT-464 and CFG920), androgen receptor antagonists (ARN-509, ODM-201, AZD-3514 and EZN-4176) and vaccine Prostvac, more drug candidates with various mechanisms or new indications of launched drugs are currently under evaluation in different stages of clinical trials, including various kinase inhibitors and platinum complexes.  Effect of an investigational CYP17A1 inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on estrogen- and corticoid-synthesis pathways in hypophysectomized female rats and on the serum estradiol levels in female cynomolgus monkeys. Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, non-steroidal inhibitor of CYP17A1 with preferential inhibition of 17,20-lyase in NCI-H295 cells.  In summary, orteronel can suppress serum estradiol concentrations in hypophysectomized female rats and monkeys through selective inhibition of CYP17A1 activity, suggesting that orteronel might be effective for hormone-dependent breast cancers and estrogen-dependent diseases. Development and validation of an RP-HPLC method for the quantitation of Orteronel (TAK-700), a CYP17A1 enzyme inhibitor, in rat plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study. Targeting the adrenal gland in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case for orteronel, a selective CYP-17 17,20-lyase inhibitor. A new CYP17 inhibitor, with more selective inhibition of 17,20-lyase over 17α-hydroxylase, orteronel (TAK-700), is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in pre- and postchemotherapy CRPC.  Effect of a novel 17,20-lyase inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on androgen synthesis in male rats. Orteronel (TAK-700), 6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2-naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A--a key enzyme in the production of steroidal hormones--and is being developed as a therapy for PC.  Orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity in rats with an IC(50) of 1200 nM but did not inhibit 17α-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) activity in rats at concentrations up to 10 μM. Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor: effects on steroid synthesis in human and monkey adrenal cells and serum steroid levels in cynomolgus monkeys. Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is under development as a drug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quantified the inhibitory activity and specificity of orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by evaluating its effects on CYP17A1 enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkey adrenal cells and human adrenal tumor cells, and serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, and testosterone after oral dosing in castrated and intact male cynomolgus monkeys.  In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys.  Discovery of orteronel (TAK-700), a naphthylmethylimidazole derivative, as a highly selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor with potential utility in the treatment of prostate cancer. Orteronel (TAK-700), 6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2-naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A--a key enzyme in the production of steroidal hormones--and is being developed as a therapy for PC. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory activity of orteronel, in particular its specificity for androgen synthesis enzymes, in male rats--an androgen-synthesis model that largely reflects this pathway in humans. In terms of human CYP17A1 and human adrenal tumor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times more potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor cells, suggesting greater specificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities in humans vs monkeys. In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys.

5339ecf4d6d3ac6a3400005f	Which is the prognostic meaning of delayed enhancement documented in patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?	 It is possible to conclude that there is a high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with high-risk or recovered from cardiac sudden death, like those with clinical indication to implantable cardioverter -defibrillator.  AF in HCM is related with myocardial fibrosis detected by DE-CMR and dilatation of the LA.  Over the follow-up period, the annualized adverse cardiovascular event rate in patients with DE exceeded that in patients without DE but did not achieve statistical significance (5.5% versus 3.3%; P=0.5).  Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients. There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, heart failure death, and all-cause mortality in HCM. Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance.  The hyperenhanced apical myocardium had a lower percentage of systolic myocardial thickening, and was associated with serious symptoms (e.g. syncope) and ventricular arrhythmias.  A semi-quantitative index of DCE is a significant multivariable predictor of both clinical VT/VF and of risk for SCD and may contribute to risk assessment in borderline or controversial cases. Myocardial scar imaged by CE-CMR is common in patients with HCM, and is predictive of VT.

Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 are rare. Clinically, these deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-CGH revealed a small interstitial 6q deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of DNA and containing only one coding gene, ARID1B.

Epizootic congenital abnormalities, encephalomyelitis and febrile illnesses in cattle caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are prevalent in Japan  Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by mosquitoes.  Nine different arboviruses are known to be transmitted by, or associated with, mosquitoes in Europe, and several (West Nile, Sindbis and Tahyna viruses) are reported to cause outbreaks of human disease Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks Arboviruses are transmitted among vertebrates by biting insects, chiefly mosquitoes and ticks Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida) Mosquito-transmitted arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and West Nile virus constitute a major public health burden and are increasing in severity and frequency worldwide. Malaria and Japanese encephalitis are the two most serious human diseases transmitted by riceland mosquitoes, but they have been incriminated as vectors of dozens of arboviruses and other parasites and pathogens including the causal agents of West Nile and Rift Valley Fevers and lymphatic filariasis. Arboviruses are transmitted by distantly related arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes (class Insecta) and ticks (class Arachnida). Many of them are transmitted by insects (arboviruses, e.g. yellow fever virus) or by rodents (e.g. Hanta viruses), others by contact with patients and nosocomial infections (e.g. Ebola virus). Arboviruses - viruses transmitted by haematophagous arthropods - are responsible for febrile syndromes, which sometimes include haemorrhagic or neurological symptoms. Arboviruses are transmitted to vertebral hosts during blood feedings by mosquitoes, ticks, biting flies, mites, and nits. Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes are a major cause of human disease worldwide. Diseases caused by arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, continue to rise in annual incidence and geographic expansion. Arboviruses transmitted by ticks must adapt to the peculiar physiological and behavioral characteristics of ticks, particularly with regard to blood feeding, bloodmeal digestion, and molting. The last decade has seen significant changes in the epidemiology of arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, particularly in relation to the intercontinental spread of Aedes albopictus. This technique enables the detection of 70 of the 80 arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes in Africa and very easily detects arbovirus associations by using either monospecific or monoclonal immune ascitic fluids (dengue-1-2-3-4 and yellow fever viruses) used in the indirect immunofluorescence technique..

Exome sequencing was performed to identify novel genes in a cohort of 99 pediatric and 134 adult-onset group I PAH patients. Novel rare variants in the gene identified were independently identified in a cohort of 680 adult-onset patients. Variants were expressed in COS cells and function assessed by patch-clamp and rubidium flux analysis.RESULTS: We identified a de novo novel heterozygous predicted deleterious missense variant c.G2873A (p.R958H) in ABCC8 in a child with idiopathic PAH. We then evaluated all individuals in the original and a second cohort for rare or novel variants in ABCC8 and identified 11 additional heterozygous predicted damaging ABCC8 variants. ABCC8 encodes SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1)-a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We observed loss of ATP-sensitive potassium channel function for all ABCC8 variants evaluated and pharmacological rescue of all channel currents in vitro by the SUR1 activator, diazoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare missense variants in ABCC8 are associated with PAH. Identified ABCC8 mutations decreased ATP-sensitive potassium channel function, which was pharmacologically recovered.	['c.G2873A', 'p.R958H']
601c17c21cb411341a00000e	The Shingrix vaccine is used to prevent what disease?	Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a challenging condition for pain management specialists. The prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and subsequent PHN in individuals aged 50 years and older, via the development of new vaccines, is an ongoing research project. The live zoster vaccine (LZV, Zostavax®) was the first proof of concept that vaccination could prevent HZ, but LZV cannot be used in various immunecompromised patients. This led to the development of a new non-live recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix®).   Previously, secondary prevention of herpes zoster required live-attenuated vaccination, which is contraindicated in immunocompromised populations. More recently, a recombinant subunit vaccine (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. SHINGRIX, a non-live recombinant herpes zoster vaccine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017. Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix) to Prevent Herpes Zoster. Two different vaccines have been developed to prevent HZ; one is based on a live attenuated VZV strain (Zostavax), and the other is based on adjuvanted gE recombinant protein (Shingrix). Shingrix is a new attenuated subunit vaccine for Varicella Zoster Virus with an AS01B adjuvant that can result in a potent immune response. In October 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant zoster vaccine under the brand name Shingrix to prevent herpes zoster. BACKGROUND: The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. ctober 2017, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GSK) as the preferred vaccine for preventing herpes zoster (HZ) and related complications in immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years.

5e319789fbd6abf43b00004a	Which molecule is inhibited by encorafenib?	Encorafenib (LGX818) is a promising BRAFV600E inhibitor that has efficacy against metastatic melanoma.  Using patient- and in vivo-derived melanoma cell lines with acquired BRAFi resistance, we show that combined treatment with the BRAFi encorafenib and HDACi panobinostat in 2D and 3D culture systems synergistically induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the pharmacological properties, preclinical and clinical data of the novel V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B (BRAF)-inhibitor encorafenib (LGX818) and to compare these with established BRAF-inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. In this study, we identify the antifolate methotrexate (MTX) as a sensitizer of acquired- and intrinsically-resistant MM cells to BRAFi's dabrafenib and encorafenib.  We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib, trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. The FDA approved the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination encorafenib/binimetinib for patients with metastatic or inoperable melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Encorafenib (Braftovi™), a BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (Mektovi®), a MEK inhibitor, are two orally bioavailable drugs developed by Array BioPharma.  Encorafenib in combination with binimetinib for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF mutations. Encorafenib plus binimetinib seems likely to emerge as a valuable therapeutic alternative to established BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations. This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class. Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.

This review will focus on the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and clinical utility of encorafenib and binimetinib in BRAF V600-mutated melanoma. Encorafenib (LGX818), a potent BRAF inhibitor, induces senescence accompanied by autophagy in BRAFV600E melanoma cells. Encorafenib (LGX818) is a new-generation BRAF inhibitor that is under evaluation in clinical trials. This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class.

Areas covered: Encorafenib in combination with bimetinib offers a new approach that may offer benefits over existing BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations. We report three male patients with metastatic BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma who developed pyogenic granulomas 16, 10, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation with the selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818). Treatment started in November 2015, with Encorafenib and Binimetinib, new BRAF and MEK inhibitors, respectively. Second-line efficacy of the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with either BRAF (encorafenib)/MEK (binimetinib) inhibitor combination or the ERK inhibitor VX-11e was confirmed in vivo Amplification of MET was observed in 3 PDX models, a higher frequency than expected and a possible novel mechanism of resistance. Areas covered: A brief review of current BRAF, NRAS, and C-KIT inhibitors provides background for a thorough review of newly developed agents namely binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, encorafenib a BRAF inhibitor, and masitinib which inhibits C-KIT. Results: Preclinical data demonstrated that encorafenib inhibited BRAF V600E kinase activity with a prolonged off-rate and suppressed proliferation and tumor growth of BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma models. This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class.

602598101cb411341a0000ae	What does tsDMARD stand for?	Whether this potential risk is specific to abatacept or extends to all biologics and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) is unclear.  To provide real-world evidence about the reasons why Australian rheumatologists cease biologic (b) and targeted synthetic (ts) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to assess (1) the primary failure rate for first-line treatment, and (2) the persistence on second-line treatments in patients who stopped first-line tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been transformed with the introduction of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) and more recently, targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) therapies in the form of janus-kinase inhibitors. Despite recommendations suggesting that biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) should be used in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), up to one-third of patients with RA are treated with monotherapy. Th Many biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) are currently available as treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but a subset of RA patients shows inadequate responses to any of these DMARDs. This A Jak inhibitor tofacitinib, the first drug of targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD), a novel category of DMARD, shows similar efficacy profile, but different safety concerns, compared to bDMARDs. Clinical trials of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) have included fatigue as a secondary endpoint. Furthermore, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) inhibiting Janus kinase (JAK) and biosimilars also are approved for RA. Treatment wise, great progress has been achieved over the last decades with the discovery and introduction in therapeutics of new molecules, such as the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. The progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases provided a rational basis for the development of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) which have completely revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory conditions. These new drugs consist of biologicals (biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, bDMARDs) as well as targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARD).

5ace1a590340b9f05800000b	What percentage of Homo sapiens DNA is of Neanderthal origin?	We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Here, we present evidence of Neanderthal introgression within the chromosome 3p21.31 region, occurring with a high frequency in East Asians (ranging from 49.4% to 66.5%) and at a low frequency in Europeans. This introgression was under positive natural selection, reached a frequency of>50%, and introduced a homocysteine level- and pigmentation-associated allele (rs460879-T) into East Asians.  Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans.  This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. 	['2-4%']

5fe08b50a43ad31278000031	How many DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS) mark the murine beta globin locus region?	Mammalian beta-globin loci are composed of multiple orthologous genes whose expression is erythroid specific and developmentally regulated. The expression of these genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR). The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals. The LCR encompasses 6 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) that bind transcription factors.  Globin gene expression is regulated, in part, by the locus control region, which physically consists of five DNaseI-hypersensitive sites located 6-22 Kb upstream of the epsilon -globin gene. he LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. These HSs are conserved among mammals, bind transcription factors that also bind to other parts of the locus, and compose the functional components of the LCR.  n addition, we have identified DNaseI-hypersensitive sites within the newly sequenced regions in both mouse and human, and these structural features also are conserved. The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) consists of four erythroid-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) at the 5' end of the beta-globin cluster.  The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is contained on a 20 kb DNA fragment and is characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitive sites in erythroid cells, termed 5'HS1-5.  In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The results show that at least three of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number dependent expression.  Targeted deletion of 5'HS1 and 5'HS4 of the beta-globin locus control region reveals additive activity of the DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors. The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is contained on a 20 kb DNA fragment and is characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitive sites in erythroid cells, termed 5'HS1-5.

The typical presentation is characterized by hemiclonic or generalized clonic seizures triggered by fever during the first year of life, followed by myoclonic, absence, focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Dravet syndrome, a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome, is typically resistant to anti-epileptic drugs (AED). Dravet syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome of infantile onset, frequently caused by SCN1A mutations or deletions. Dravet syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple types of seizures. Haploinsufficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 causes Dravet syndrome, an intractable childhood-onset epilepsy with hyperactivity, cognitive deficit, autistic-like behaviours, and premature death Thus, the multi-faceted phenotypes of Dravet syndrome can be genetically dissected, revealing synergy in causing epilepsy, premature death and deficits in long-term spatial memory, but interneuron-specific effects on hyperactivity and autistic-like behaviours Dravet syndrome, or as it was called in the past severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is a drug-resistant epilepsy first described by Charlotte Dravet in 1978 Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, refractory form of epilepsy, for whose treatment stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed for add-on use.To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments (including ketogenic diet) as therapy for patients with SMEI.We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (15 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4 of 12, The Cochrane Library, April 2013), MEDLINE (1 Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha-1 subunit gene SCN1A. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy largely refractory to current antiepileptic medications.  Dravet syndrome is a rare epileptic encephalopathy characterized by treatment-resistant polymorphic seizures.  Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset epileptic seizures followed by ataxia and cognitive decline. Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy.  Dravet syndrome or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) is a baleful epileptic encephalopathy that begins in the first year of life.  Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types, developmental slowing and poor outcome Dravet syndrome is an intractable epileptic syndrome beginning in the first year of life. Dravet syndrome is an epileptic syndrome of infancy and early childhood. Dravet syndrome is an epileptic syndrome of infancy. patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet's syndrome) Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy caused in approximately 80% of cases by mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel subunit gene SCN1A	['A severe epilepsy of chidhood']

52bf19c503868f1b06000001	What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?	autosomal dominant FSHD1 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement, and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by weakness of the face, upper arm, shoulder, and lower limb musculature, with an onset between the first and third decades.  Clinical diagnosis is made from the distinctive pattern of weakness, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and confirmed by genetic testing.  In one family together with prenatal diagnosis founder mutation in FSHD A1 gene was detected, according to the autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a primary muscle disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance remarkable for its early involvement of facial musculature. Consensual diagnostic criteria for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) include onset of the disease in facial or shoulder girdle muscles, facial weakness in more than 50% of affected family members, autosomal dominant inheritance in familial cases, and evidence of myopathic disease in at least one affected member without biopsy features specific to alternative diagnoses Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant muscular disorder associated with a short (<35 kb) EcoRI/BlnI fragment resulting from deletion of an integral number of units of a 3.3-kb repeat located at 4q35. In 139 families, dominant inheritance was observed in 97, a pattern compatible with germline mosaicism in 6, while sporadic cases were found in 36 families.

58a32efe60087bc10a000013	What is MRSA?	(MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) Community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a severe health concern because of its treatment difficulties. We investigated the distribution of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) on and around six patients with MRSA infection in our neurosurgical ward. The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at respiratory sites shed viable MRSA into the air of hospital rooms. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in prevalence among asymptomatic carriers and in cases of paediatric soft-tissue infections alike. Most of MRSA strains and a part of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains harbored unique combinations of non-ß-lactamase genes aac(6)/aph(2″), aph(3)-III, ant (4,4″), ermA, ermC, mrsA, tetM, and tetK Healthcare- and Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Fatal Pneumonia with Pediatric Deaths in Krasnoyarsk, Siberian Russia: Unique MRSAs Multiple Virulence Factors, Genome, and Stepwise Evolution It was found in the present study that combined use of fusidic acid (FA) and berberine chloride (BBR) offered an in vitro synergistic action against 7 of the 30 clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, with a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index ranging from 0.5 to 0.19 Vancomycin MIC creep in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from 2006 to 2010 in a hospital in China To assess whether vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creeps among clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a regional hospital in China Detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in specimens from various body sites: performance characteristics of the BD GeneOhm MRSA assay, the Xpert MRSA assay, and broth-enriched culture in an area with a low prevalence of MRSA infections.

Long-term control of endemic hospital-wide methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the impact of targeted active surveillance for MRSA in patients and healthcare workers. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections pose a major challenge in health care, yet the limited heterogeneity within this group hinders molecular investigations of related outbreaks. In a previous study, we reported that two kaempferol glycosides isolated from Laurus nobilis L., kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2'',4''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C2) and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl-4''-Z-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C3), showed strong antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This article explains what methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is, how it is spread and what the real challenges are in healthcare settings in the UK. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging threat to public health, especially in correctional settings. There are few more compelling questions in clinical microbiology today than the issue of whether or not to screen for the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with the results being used to institute infection control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of MRSA in health care environments.

56cf236f3975bb303a000002	Which calcium channels does ethosuximide target?	In the present study, we examined whether ethosuximide (ETX), a T-channel antagonist, could decrease the severity of ethanol withdrawal seizures by evaluating electrographical and behavioral correlates of seizure activity. In rats, intraplantar (i.pl.) administration of db-cAMP or PGE(2)  caused mechanical hyperalgesia, an effect suppressed by AKAPI, two distinct T-channel blockers, NNC 55-0396 and ethosuximide, or ZnCl(2) , known to inhibit Ca(v) 3.2 among T channels. Theta rhythms remained disrupted during a subsequent week of withdrawal but were restored with the T-type channel blocker ethosuximide. Given evidence that chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is blocked by ethosuximide, known to block T-type calcium channels, we examined if more selective T-type calcium channel blockers and also inhibitors of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), a major H₂S-forming enzyme in the peripheral tissue, are capable of reversing the neuropathic pain evoked by paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug. The results demonstrate that both ethosuximide and the active metabolite of methsuximide, alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccinimide (MPS), block human T-type channels in a state-dependent manner, with higher affinity for inactivated channels. T-type channels display current at the end of long pulses (persistent current), and this current was especially sensitive to block (ethosuximide IC(50) = 0.6 mM). We tested the effects of several T-type calcium channel blockers, including zonisamide (ZNS), ethosuximide, lomerizine, amiloride, mibefradil, and NCC 55-0396, a mibefradil derivative, on tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements (TJMs), an animal model of parkinsonian tremor. The antihyperalgesic effects of the T-type calcium channel blockers ethosuximide, trimethadione, and mibefradil. Gallopamil and another T-type-channel blocker, ethosuximide, were included for comparison. The Ca(v)3.2 channel is sensitive to ethosuximide, amlodipine and amiloride. The purpose of the present study was to explore the analgesic effects of the low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channel blockers ethosuximide, trimethadione, and mibefradil in persistent and acute nociceptive tests. We tested the effects of several T-type calcium channel blockers, including zonisamide (ZNS), ethosuximide, lomerizine, amiloride, mibefradil, and NCC 55-0396, a mibefradil derivative, on tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements (TJMs), an animal model of parkinsonian tremor.  We focused on two T-type calcium blockers, trimethadione and ethosuximide, which are anti-epileptics approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Gallopamil and another T-type-channel blocker, ethosuximide, were included for comparison. 	['T-type calcium channels']
5156be04d24251bc05000085	What gene test is recommended for clopidogrel?	polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene affect clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. This study sought to evaluate the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the pharmacodynamic effect of high- or standard-dose clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). CYP2C19, but not PON1 or ABCB1, is a significant determinant of the pharmacodynamic effects of clopidogrel, both early and late after PCI. In patients with high OTR identified by platelet function testing, the CYP2C19 genotype provides limited incremental information regarding the risk of persistently high reactivity with clopidogrel 150-mg maintenance dosing. (Genotype Information and Functional Testing Study [GIFT]; NCT00992420). Variants in the CYP2C19 gene influence the pharmacologic and clinical response to the standard 75-mg daily maintenance dose of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel. OBJECTIVE: To test whether higher doses (up to 300 mg daily) improve the response to clopidogrel in the setting of loss-of-function CYP2C19 genotypes. polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene affect clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. These polymorphisms may be useful to identify clopidogrel nonresponders who may benefit from taking an alternative antiplatelet agent such as prasugrel and ticagrelor. Although both drugs have pharmacogenomic tests available for clinical use, The CYP2C19*2 allele is a common genetic variant associated with increased rates of major adverse events in individuals given clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We used a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele and aimed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treatment after PCI The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel has been linked to cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) carrier status. The presence of loss of function and gain of function variants were found to have a gene-dose effect on clopidogrel metabolism. However, genotyping is only one aspect of predicting response to clopidogrel and several platelet function tests are available to measure platelet response. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 loss-of-function allele has been associated with impaired clopidogrel response and worse prognosis in clopidogrel-treated patients. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefit of tailored therapy with a higher maintenance dose according to CYP2C19 genotypes in patients identified as nonresponders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 isoenzyme plays an important role in clopidogrel metabolization. A recently explored CYP2C19*17 allelic variant has been linked to increased transcriptional activity, resulting in extensive metabolization of CYP2C19 substrates, which may lead to an enhanced platelet response to clopidogrel treatment. To identify gene variants that influence clopidogrel response. A genome-wide association study was performed followed by genotyping the loss-of-function cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 variant (rs4244285). Findings in the PAPI Study were extended by examining the relation of CYP2C19*2 genotype to platelet function and cardiovascular outcomes in an independent sample of 227 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Coexisting polymorphisms of the genes affecting clopiogrel resistance may influence platelet activation. Genotyping revealed 7 carriers of both the C allele of P2Y12 and A allele of CYP2C19 (group 1), 14 carriers of the T allele of P2Y12 and A allele of CYP2C19 (group 2), 17 carriers of the C allele of P2Y12 and G allele of CYP2C19 (group 3) and 67 carriers of the T allele of P2Y12 and G allele of CYP2C19 (controls). to evaluate the effect of polymorphisms affecting the clopidogrel metabolism (CYP3A4 IVS10+12G/A and CYP2C19*2) and the P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12 T744C) on modulating platelet function in acute coronary syndrome patients on dual antiplatelet treatment. to test the influence of the CYP 2C19*2 allele on clopidogrel responsiveness. Genetic polymorphisms significantly influence responses to warfarin and clopidogrel. A recent clinical trial has demonstrated that patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the reduced function allele CYP2C19*2 (*2 allele), who are treated with thienopyridines, have an increased risk of adverse cardiac events with clopidogrel, but not with prasugrel.

The outcomes assessed were motor symptoms with Unified PD Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII), functional mobility with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), endurance with 6 min walking test (6MWT), freezing of gait with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG_Q), walking velocity with GAITRite and QL with PD Questionnaire (PDQ39).   They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ).  The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was "mobility."  In the 43% of cases in whom oral therapy was changed, total UPDRS improved significantly (effect size = 8) as did the PDQ39 in cases reaching target. NMS Quest and MOCA scores also improved significantly. This study shows that many people in a representative cohort of PD would benefit from objective assessment and treatment of their PD features against a target. Here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach, diffusion MRI connectometry, to investigate the correlation of quality of life, evaluated by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) with the white matter structural connectivity in 27 non-demented PD patients (disease duration of 5.3 ± 2.9 years, H and Y stage = 1.5 ± 0.6, UPDRS-III = 13.7 ± 6.5, indicating unilateral and mild motor involvement).  The present study aimed to assess the beneficial and side effects of STN DBS in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients. Material and Methods: Thirty five patients underwent bilateral STN DBS from 2008 to 2016 in the Rabat University Hospital. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL). The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (K-NMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)]. METHODS: Static posturography (Centre of Pressure -CoP- parameters), gait (the Ten-Meter Walk Test [TMWT]), freezing of gait (the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire [FOG-Q]), the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and patient-perceived quality of life (the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire [PDQ39]), were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and re-test. The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is growing worldwide. Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied. Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep. One hundred thirty patients with PD completed a booklet of questionnaires, which included the PDQ39 as a disease-specific measure of QoL, a symptom checklist, a mobility checklist, as well as patient ratings of disease stage and disability. At 70% sensitivity, the specificity for PDQ39 score and PD Symptoms Questionnaire score for the prediction of parkinsonism was 73.1% and 80.1%, respectively. Workers completed a health status questionnaire (PDQ39) and a Parkinson disease (PD) Symptoms Questionnaire. As for specific questionnaires: the Parkinson`s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) have been described. HRQOL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D and the specific questionnaire Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items.

We propose a new and easy-to-use web tool MIENTURNET (MicroRNA ENrichment TURned NETwork) that receives in input a list of miRNAs or mRNAs and tackles the problem of prioritizing miRNA-target interactions by performing a statistical analysis followed by a fully featured network-based visualization and analysis. The statistics is used to assess the significance of an over-representation of miRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters based on the statistical significance associated with each miRNA-target interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to infer possible evidences of miRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of the miRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise analysis of the individual components.CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the miRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to independently investigate miRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web interface.

56c58ceeb04e159d0e000004	What is the function of circular RNA?	Here we determine the structure of these novel transcripts, showing that they correspond to circular RNA molecules containing only exons in genomic order. Thousands of loci in the human and mouse genomes give rise to circular RNA transcripts; at many of these loci, the predominant RNA isoform is a circle. Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each gene were cell-type specific. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression program. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs.  For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. An unexpectedly large fraction of genes in metazoans (human, mouse, zebrafish, worm, fruit fly) express high levels of circularized RNAs containing canonical exons. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or 'piggyback' on signals used in alternative RNA processing. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases.  Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges.

54db62a3034aea571d000001	Which is the main calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum?	sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump (SERCA) the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) SERCA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting cytosolic calcium into the ER lumen. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) is the pump crucial for calcium homeostasis and its impairment results in pathologies such as myopathy, heart failure or diabetes. Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, was found to be a key factor in the alteration of calcium cycling. The calcium pump SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a), which plays a central role in cardiac contraction, shows decreased expression in heart failure (HF). Calcium is actively accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium transport ATPases (SERCA enzymes). sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca�z ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane-bound pump that utilizes ATP to drive calcium ions from the myocyte cytosol against the higher calcium concentration in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

At present, many endoscopic indices of ulcerative colitis have been introduced, including the Truelove and Witts Endoscopy Index, Baron Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Sutherland Index, Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Sub-Score, Rachmilewitz Index, Modified Baron Index, Endoscopic Activity Index, Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Ulcerative Colitis Colonoscopic Index of Severity, and Modified Mayo Endoscopic Score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a corticosteroid-refractory flare of UC who did not respond to calcineurin inhibitors and received continuing salvage therapy with adalimumab were included in this retrospective, observational, single-centre study. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission and response were evaluated based on the Rachmilewitz index.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index.  A prospective open-label, single-center study was performed in 10 patients with active UC (Rachmilewitz Clinical Activity Index [CAI] ≥ 8 points; Rachmilewitz Endoscopic Index ≥ 7 points).  METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate IBD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <220 or Rachmilewitz Index (RI) <11) were randomized 1:1 to either supervised moderate-intensity running thrice a week for 10 weeks or a control group who were not prescribed any exercise.  BACKGROUND: To investigate whether anxiety and depression levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).METHODS: The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Endoscopic disease activities were scored independently according to the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD in patients with CD and to the Rachmilewitz Index in patients with UC. The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index.  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this study was to assess the concordance between the Rachmilewitz endoscopic activity index (EAI) and the Harpaz histopathological activity scoring system (HSS), which are used for evaluating the disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index. Disease activity was described according to Rachmilewitz scale in UC and in CD according to Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). RESULTS  Following 12 months, allogeneic bone marrow (BM) MSC transplantation performed thrice during a month caused the greatest reduction in the Rachmilewitz clinical activity index, Mayo endoscopic activity index, and Gebs pathohistological index in patients with UC as compared to those who had underwent one transplantation or received 5-ASA preparations and GCS (p < 0.05). Ulcerative colitis: correlation of the Rachmilewitz endoscopic activity index with fecal calprotectin, clinical activity, C-reactive protein, and blood leukocytes. METHODS  UC patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled and scored independently according the endoscopic and clinical part of the Rachmilewitz Index. BACKGROUND  The accuracy of noninvasive markers for the detection of endoscopically active ulcerative colitis (UC) according the Rachmilewitz Score is so far unknown. Clinical activity in Chron's disease was measured by Crohn disease activity index and in ulcerative colitis patients by Rachmilewitz endoscopic index.

51588bb2d24251bc05000091	Which antiepileptic drug is most strongly associated with spina bifida? 	The teratogenicity of antiepilepsy drug valproic acid (VPA) mostly is found in genetic and somatic levels, causing teratogenesis involving neurotubular defects (NTDs), anencephaly, lumbosacral meningomyelocele, and leg dysfunction due to spina bifida aperta. The summary odds ratio estimate for the association between valproic acid and spina bifida was 11.9 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.0-21.2); for valproic acid and cleft palate 5.8 (95% UI: 3.3-9.5); for carbamazepine and spina bifida 3.6 (95% UI: 1.3-7.8); and for carbamazepine and cleft palate 2.4 (95% UI: 1.1-4.5) in the United States. Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy.  Valproic acid, a drug commonly used to treat seizures and other psychiatric disorders, causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in exposed fetuses at a rate 20 times higher than in the general population. Failure of the neural tube to close during development results in exencephaly or anencephaly, as well as spina bifida. Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid.  Fetal exposure to valproic acid or carbamazepine increases the risk of neural tube defect (NTD) Women with epilepsy giving birth during 1973 to 1991 were identified by record linkage of Swedish health registries. Among 3,625 identified infants, 9 had spina bifida. A nested case-control study was performed, comparing drugs used in early pregnancy in the 9 cases and in 18 controls, matched for year of delivery, maternal age, and parity. Six of the spina bifida mothers had used carbamazepine and two had used valproic acid. Among the controls, 5 women used carbamazepine and one valproic acid. There is an apparent excess risk for spina bifida after use of either of these two drugs, but it is not statistically significant when the analysis is restricted to drug-using women. T A significant association was seen between maternal use of valproic acid and spina bifida, and a weaker, non-significant one between carbamazepine and spina bifida. A statistically significant association between Spina Bifida and Valproic Acid (odds ratio 22.7; Fisher p value = 0.0364) was observed: no other anticonvulsant tested showed any association with any type of malformation.

The inhibition of dopamine synthesis in fetuses changes the pattern of T-lymphocyte maturation in the thymus of adult rats.

Role of the MHC restriction during maturation of antigen-specific human T cells in the thymus. This first ex vivo analysis of human antigen-specific thymocytes at different stages of human T-cell development should open new perspectives in the understanding of the human thymic selection process. CD44 promotes progenitor homing into the thymus and T cell maturation. Delayed functional maturation of natural regulatory T cells in the medulla of postnatal thymus: role of TSLP. Effects of nicotine exposure on T cell development in fetal thymus organ culture: arrest of T cell maturation. Furthermore, d-tubocurarine alone blocked the development of both immature and mature murine thymocytes, suggesting the presence of an endogenous ligand that may engage nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on developing thymocytes and influence the course of normal thymic ontogeny. However, both DP T cell subsets have an intrathymic origin since they appear in the recent thymic emigrant population after injection of FITC intrathymically.

5a871a6861bb38fb24000009	What disease is the ALK tyrosine kinase associated with?	ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a T-cell lymphoma usually occurring in children and young adults. I  A 62-year-old Caucasian non-smoking woman was diagnosed with cT4N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma. Initial biopsy showed EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement Significant prognostic factors included the original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in patients with adenocarcinoma investigational ALK inhibitor brigatinib is active in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, initially identified through the analysis of a specific translocation associated with a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently it was demonstrated that ALK is frequently mutated in sporadic cases with advanced neuroblastoma. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is an important molecular target in neuroblastoma. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogating ALK activity are currently in clinical use for the treatment of ALK-positive (ALK(+)) disease, monotherapy with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors may not be an adequate solution for ALK(+) neuroblastoma patients. Insights into ALK-driven cancers revealed through development of novel ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. The ALK gene is silent in adult tissues except for restricted sites within the nervous system (consequently, patients with ALK-positive lymphoma produce antibodies to the ALK protein) but is expressed in some neuroblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. BACKGROUND The translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene on chromosome 2p have been identified in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) as oncogenic driver mutations. SUMMARY The ALK protein functions as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase; rearrangements of the ALK gene are associated with the development of NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement lung cancer responds to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor, has been initially identified through its involvement in chromosomal translocations associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements can derive significant clinical benefit from ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Two ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), crizotinib and ceritinib, are currently approved in Europe for use in ALK-positive NSCLC and several others are in development. This review summarises the latest research on the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK, and how this information can guide the management of patients with cancer that is ALK-positive. Genetic rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene occur in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomoas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and other cancers. <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: NSCLC with de novo anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements and EGFR or KRAS mutations co-occur very rarely. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to treatment with an ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (-TKI). The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase was initially discovered as a component of the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene originally discovered nearly 20 years ago in the context of anaplastic large cell lymphoma were identified as oncogenic drivers in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in 2007. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement identifies a population of NSCLCs in whom dysregulation of ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, ALK has been identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas.  Rearrangements in ALK gene and EML4 gene were first described in 2007. This genomic aberration is found in about 2%-8% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is a T cell lymphoma defined by the presence of chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene.  Renal Medullary Carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive malignancy that affects young black individuals with sickle cell trait. No effective treatment is available, resulting in an ominous clinical course, with overall survival averaging less than four months. We report rearrangement of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in a pediatric case of RMC harboring a t(2;10)(p23;q22) translocation  Aberrant ALK activity has been implicated in the oncogenesis of human cancers as a fusion protein in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, systemic histiocytosis and NSCLC or through mutations in the full length protein in hereditary familial neuroblastoma.  Chromosomal rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) occur in a variety of human malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. NPM/ALK is an oncogenic fusion protein expressed in approximately 50% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases. It derives from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with the dimerization domain of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) protein. Rearrangements involving the ALK gene were identified in a variety of cancers, genetic alterations are mutations in the kinase domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which have been found in both somatic and familial neuroblastom  The aim of this study is to investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein expression and underlying genetic aberrations in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), with special attention to clinical and prognostic implications Anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) fusion is a distinct molecular subclassification of NSCLC that is targeted by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors.  The discovery of translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers has become a paradigm for precision medicine The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in the pathogenesis of different types of human cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB)	['cancer']
5e4ada686d0a277941000014	Which method is behind HipMCL?	HipMCL: a high-performance parallel implementation of the Markov clustering algorithm for large-scale networks. Biological networks capture structural or functional properties of relevant entities such as molecules, proteins or genes. Characteristic examples are gene expression networks or protein-protein interaction networks, which hold information about functional affinities or structural similarities. Such networks have been expanding in size due to increasing scale and abundance of biological data. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of ∼70 million nodes with ∼68 billion edges in ∼2.4 h. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks. HipMCL is based on MPI and OpenMP and is freely available under a modified BSD license. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks.

5ace17c30340b9f058000009	Which olfactory gene senses androsterone?	any mammals can decipher these scent codes to discern the gender, age, endocrine status, social status, and genotype of conspecifics using dedicated sensory receptors in their olfactory system. A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor OR7D4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene (P = 1.1 × 10(-4)).  These findings suggest that 1) the perceived intensity of some but not all odorants is a heritable trait, 2) use of a current genome-wide marker panel did not detect a known olfactory genotype-phenotype association, and 3) person-to-person differences in androstenone perception are influenced by OR7D4 genotype and perhaps by variants of other genes. The flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene (OR7D4) and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1D). A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor OR7D4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene (P = 1.1 × 10(-4)).	['OR7D4']
56c83f365795f9a73e000011	Which domain allowing self-association do exist in TDP-43 and FUS proteins?	Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules. Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. Approximately 1% of human proteins harbor a prion-like domain (PrLD) of similar low complexity sequence and amino acid composition to domains that drive prionogenesis of yeast proteins like Sup35. PrLDs are over-represented in human RNA-binding proteins and mediate phase transitions underpinning RNP granule assembly. This modality renders PrLDs prone to misfold into conformers that accrue in pathological inclusions that characterize various fatal neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which rank 1st and 10th among RRM-bearing prion candidates, form cytoplasmic inclusions in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS cause familial ALS.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, that harbor prion-like domains, cause some forms of ALS. two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins. Mutations in related RNA-binding proteins TDP-43, FUS/TLS and TAF15 have been connected to ALS. These three proteins share several features, including the presence of a bioinformatics-predicted prion domain, aggregation-prone nature in vitro and in vivo and toxic effects when expressed in multiple model systems. Moreover, two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins TDP-43 and FUS and several related RNA-binding proteins harbor aggregation-promoting prion-like domains that allow them to rapidly self-associate. Molecular cloning of subunit 4 of the complex revealed that it is a proteasome-COP9 complex-eIF3 domain protein encoded by a gene that maps to chromosome 5, near the chromosomal location of the cop8 and fus4 mutations.  Deletions in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 that preclude interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 abolish TDP-43-dependent rescue of CGG repeat toxicity. The rescue appears specific to TDP-43, as co-expression of another ALS-associated RNA-binding protein, FUS, exacerbates the toxic effects of CGG repeats Recently, through Next-Generation Exome sequencing approaches a mutation resulting in a substitution (p.Q290X) in the nuclear export domain of the FUS protein was nominated as a cause of autosomal dominant essential tremor (ET) in a large kindred TDP-43 is another RNA-binding protein implicated in ALS We also provide multiple independent lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence that EWSR1 has similar properties as TDP-43, FUS and TAF15, including aggregation-prone behavior in vitro and ability to confer neurodegeneration in Drosophila. For TDP-43, both the RRM1 and the C-terminal glycine-rich domain are required for SG localization. Furthermore, TDP-43 and FUS display distinct domain requirements in aggregate formation and cytotoxicity. Binding was mediated by an unstructured TDP-43 C-terminal domain and occurred within the context of a 300-400-kDa complex that also contained C-terminal cleavage products of TDP-43 linked to neuropathology. It was recently found that dominant mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding domain protein) and FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma) cause a subset of ALS.

56f564f909dd18d46b000009	Which syndrome is associated with mutations in the LYST gene?	Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. A small number of reports of rare, attenuated forms of CHS exist, with affected individuals exhibiting progressive neurodegenerative disease beginning in early adulthood with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, features of spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as subtle pigmentary abnormalities and subclinical or absent immune dysfunction. Mutations in the CHS1 (LYST) gene result in CHS. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by variable degrees of oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections, and a mild bleeding tendency, with late neurologic dysfunction. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the LYST/CHS1 gene, which encodes for a 429 kDa protein, CHS1/LYST, that regulates vesicle trafficking and determines the size of lysosomes and other organelles.

52bf208003868f1b06000019	What is the inheritance pattern of Li–Fraumeni syndrome?	It therefore appears that the LFS phenotype has been conferred by an aberrant gene, showing a dominant pattern of inheritance, which may be acting to compromise normal p53 function rather than by a mutation in p53 itself. In addition, there seem to be predispositions to a wider range of different, but well-defined neoplasms: e.g., adenocarcinomatosis of the colon and the endometrium, or the Li-Fraumeni/SBLA syndrome. The latter shows a spectrum of sarcoma, brain tumours, breast cancer, leukaemias, lung and adenocortical cancer. The genes leading to these types of dominantly inherited predispositions appear to be the tentatively so-called tumour suppressor genes, for which the Rb gene serves as a model he Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disease whose hallmark is a predisposition to a wide range of cancers among members of a family.

51487dead24251bc05000030	Which pharmacogenetic test is available for abacavir?	Pharmacogenomic tests offer a promising strategy to improve the safety and efficacy of drug treatment. Compelling examples, such as HLA-B*5701 testing to identify patients at risk for abacavir-associated hypersensitivity, are already changing clinical care International HIV treatment guidelines recommend HLA-B*57:01 typing before abacavir administration, in order to reduce the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions, the major cause of early therapy discontinuation. A fast, sensitive and specific test for HLA-B*57:01 detection has been developed in the present study. The rollout of HLA-B∗5701 into routine clinical practice as a genetic screening test to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity provides a translational roadmap for other drugs. he aim of the session, using real-world examples (KRAS/panitumumab and HLA-B*5701/abacavir), was to identify good scientific principles that would guide the design of studies to identify subgroups of responders during development programs (including marketed drugs), which could subsequently be used to guide treatment decisions. HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is an example of a test now in widespread routine clinical use in the developed world. Successful results that have been achieved within the field of pharmacogenomics so far are, to name a few, HLA-B*5701 screening to avoid hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral abacavir, Prospective pharmacogenetic screening for the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701 allele can significantly reduce the number of cases of abacavir-related hypersensitivity among HIV-infected patients treated with this drug. development of HLA-B*5701 genetic screening as a means of preventing drug hypersensitivity reactions caused by a commonly prescribed antiretroviral drug, abacavir. Abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a potentially life-threatening illness occurring in 4-8% of those initiating the drug. Early studies identified a strong association between the MHC class I allele HLA-B*5701 and AHS. These studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 holds promise as a screening test to prevent AHS, but concern arose from HLA-B*5701-negative cases with a clinical diagnosis of AHS, and particularly from early reports of apparently low sensitivities of HLA-B*5701 for AHS in patients of non-White race. However, open screening studies suggested that HLA-B*5701 screening can largely eliminate AHS Current HIV treatment guidelines have been revised to reflect the recommendation that HLA-B*5701 screening be incorporated into routine care for patients who may require abacavir. The research approach applied to AHS has led to a genetic screening test being successfully implemented globally in primary HIV clinical practice. The clinical utility of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening was demonstrated in a blinded randomized clinical trial and in open-label cohorts. Screening has been incorporated into clinical practice and the ABC HSR pharmacogenetics program has been highlighted as a success by pharmacogenetics researchers. Abacavir hypersensitivity (ABC HSR) is a treatment-limiting adverse event associated with the use of the antiretroviral medicine, abacavir. The major histocompatibility complex allele, HLA-B*5701, was identified retrospectively and confirmed with independent sample sets. he most significant advance for clinical practice is the correlation between the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele and hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In particular, one clinical trial with a large number of patients from distinct ethnic groups found that the probability of not developing hypersensitivity reaction (immunologically confirmed) was 100% if the patient was HLA-B*5701-negative. These data suggest the need to implement this test in daily clinical practice. The aim of the PREDICT-1 study was to determine the clinical utility of the pharmacogenetic test identifying HLA-B*5701 to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, diagnosed clinically and with immunological confirmation, as well as to reduce unwarranted withdrawal of this drug the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing, immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events Pharmacogenetic testing for HLA-B*5701 is cost-effective only if abacavir-based treatment is as effective and costs less than tenofovir-based treatment. HLA-B*5701 testing remained the preferred strategy only if abacavir-based treatment had equal efficacy and cost less per month than tenofovir-based treatment. Results were also sensitive to the cost of HLA-B*5701 testing and the prevalence of HLA-B*5701. The strong association of the abacavir hypersensitivity reaction with HLA-B*5701 permits testing patients for the allele, and if present avoiding the drug and therefore preventing the reaction. Although the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701 is highly associated with a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) to abacavir (ABC), variable sensitivities have been reported when clinical data alone have been used to define an ABC HSR Although IC ABC HSRs are uncommon in black persons, the 100% sensitivity of HLA-B*5701 as a marker for IC ABC HSRs in both US white and black patients suggests similar implications of the association between HLA-B*5701 positivity and risk of ABC HSRs in both races. A strong statistical association between the major histocompatibility complex allele, HLA-B*5701, and clinically diagnosed ABC HSR was identified but varied between racial populations. In a randomized, prospective study evaluating the clinical utility of HLA-B*5701 screening, avoidance of ABC in HLA-B*5701-positive patients significantly reduced clinically diagnosed ABC HSR and eliminated patch test-positive ABC HSR. Finally, a retrospective PGx study supports the generalizability of the association across races. Prospective HLA-B*5701 screening should greatly reduce the incidence of ABC HSR by identifying patients at high risk for ABC HSR before they are treated. Hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. In predominantly white populations, similar to the one in this study, 94% of patients do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele and are at low risk for hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Our results show that a pharmacogenetic test can be used to prevent a specific toxic effect of a drug. For abacavir in particular, the use of HLA-B*5701 as a screening test appears to be generalizable across racially diverse populations and has been supported by both observational, and blinded randomized controlled trials. HLA-B*5701 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity is currently the most relevant to clinical practice and highlights that the promise of cost-effective testing can be facilitated by robust laboratory methodology and quality assurance programs that can be applied to diverse treatment settings. the major histocompatibility complex HLA-B*5701 allele has been associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir (ABC) by several independent researchers. The strong association between HLA-B5701 and abacavir hypersensitivity reaction shows promise for a genetic screening test to be feasibly incorporated into clinical practice. Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction (ABC HSR) is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction that affects approximately 8% of patients that initiate this antiretroviral drug. Independent groups have shown a strong predictive association between ABC HSR and HLA-B*5701, indicating that exclusion of HLA-B*5701 positive individuals from abacavir treatment would largely prevent ABC HSR. Abacavir, a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, causes severe hypersensitivity in 4-8% of patients. HLA B*5701 is a known genetic risk factor for abacavir hypersensitivity in Caucasians. Abacavir hypersensitivity is associated with HLA B*5701, and pre-prescription pharmacogenetic testing for this appears to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.	['HLA B*5701 genotyping']
5c74305d7c78d694710000a4	Which mRNAs are sequestered in stress granules?	short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs)  By using a series of chimaeric transcripts, we have demonstrated that transcript localization at the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the signals dictating stress granule sequestration. Stress granules are higher order assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs and proteins that form when translation initiation is inhibited. Partially due to the belief that translationally suppressed mRNAs are recruited to SGs in bulk, stress-induced dynamic redistribution of mRNA has not been thoroughly characterized This subset, characterized by extended length and adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich motifs, is highly enriched with genes critical for cell survival and proliferation mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability These results suggest that stress granules may not represent a specific biological program of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, but instead form by condensation of nontranslating mRNPs in proportion to their length and lack of association with ribosomes.

5abbe429fcf456587200001c	What is the drug target for Eliquis (Apixaban)?	The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) include dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®), a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Apixaban (Eliquis) and Edoxaban (Lixiana®), which are direct anti-Xa inhibitors The new direct oral anticoagulants directly targeting thrombin (factor IIa) or factor-Xa, are currently used for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (rivaroxaban, Xarelto) or for the prevention of systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (rivaroxaban; dabigatran, Pradaxa; Apixaban, Eliquis). Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical practice. The direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban (Eliquis(®)) has predictable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and does not require routine anticoagulation monitoring. The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) include dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®), a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), Apixaban (Eliquis) and Edoxaban (Lixiana®), which are direct anti-Xa inhibitors. BACKGROUND: apixaban (BMS-562247) (Eliquis(®)) is a novel, orally active, selective, direct, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa). They include the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim) and the oral direct FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Bayer HealthCare), apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb), and edoxaban (Lixiana/Savaysa, Daiichi-Sankyo). Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. FDA and are in current clinical practice. Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Apixaban (Eliquis™), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer as a therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of thrombotic disorders. These specific substances directly block either thrombin (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) or Factor Xa (e.g., apixaban). Due to the high protein binding the direkt FXa-inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®) can not be hemodialysed. Apixaban (Eliquis®) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE).	['factor Xa']

56d1e23c67f0cb3d66000009	Which are the coactivators of the Yes-associated protein (yap)?	ndependent research, often in the context of muscle biology, described Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors, which bind CATTCC DNA motifs to regulate gene expression. These two research areas were joined by the finding that the Hippo pathway regulates the activity of Tead transcription factors mainly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivators Yap and Taz, which bind to and activate Teads. TEADs on their own are unable to activate transcription and they require the help of coactivators. Several TEAD-interacting coactivators are known and they can be classified into three groups: (1) YAP and its paralog TAZ; YAP and TAZ are transcription coactivators and effectors of the Hippo pathway, which play a key role in organ size control. Through interaction with transcription factors such as TEADs, they activate gene transcription and thus promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate cell differentiation.  The YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex also upregulates several other proliferation-promoting genes and also promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation. hree-dimensional structure of the YAP-TEAD complex	['Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors.']
5a8056a2faa1ab7d2e00001f	Which web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes has been developed?	iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10 years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.

5ace238e0340b9f05800000d	Which human chromosome is the product of fusion?	The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin.  It is known that human chromosome 2 originated from the fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes.  Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion. We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2. Human chromosome 2 is a product of a telomere fusion of two ancestral chromosomes and loss/degeneration of one of the two original centromeres. We investigate the most recent product of a chromosome fusion event fixed in the human lineage, human chromosome 2, whose stability was acquired by the suppression of one centromere, resulting in a unique difference in chromosome number between humans (46 chromosomes) and our most closely related ape relatives (48 chromosomes). Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. By doing so, one is able to provide evidence for the presence of both active and degenerate centromeric satellite profiles on chromosome 2 in these archaic genomes, supporting the hypothesis that the chromosomal fusion event took place prior to our last common ancestor with Denisovan and Neandertal hominins and presenting a genomic reference for predicting karyotype in ancient genomic datasets.<br> Centromere Destiny in Dicentric Chromosomes: New Insights from the Evolution of Human Chromosome 2 Ancestral Centromeric Region. Human chromosome 2 arose as a result of a telomeric fusion between acrocentric chromosomes, whereas chromosomes 4 and 19 in Gorilla gorilla are the products of a reciprocal translocation between ancestral chromosomes, syntenic to human chromosomes 5 and 17, respectively. Our results suggest two possible centromere inactivation models to explain the evolutionarily stabilization of human chromosome 2 over the last 5-6 million years.	['chromosome 2', '2']

The origin of Alu-derived minisatellites appears to have been mediated by short flanking repeats, as first proposed by Haber and Louis Finally, we propose that the origin of Alu subfamilies in human populations may be related to evolution of chromosome Y. Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element Alu elements are each a dimer of similar, but not identical, fragments of total size about 300 bp, and originate from the 7SL RNA gene.

5e31cceafbd6abf43b000052	What is the chromosomal location of the LDL receptor gene associated with autosomal dominant Familial Hypercholesterolemia?	Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited metabolic disorder resulting in advanced vascular atherosclerosis and premature death, primarily from coronary artery disease. The primary defect is a mutation in the gene encoding for the plasma LDL receptor located on the short arm of chromosome 19. Mutations in the LDLr gene (LDLR), which is located on chromosome 19, cause familial hypercholesterolemia Chromosome 19 is short but has higher relative density of genes than other chromosomes. Increasing number of the genes coding for proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases have been mapped on chromosome 19. Mutations of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) result in one of the most frequent mendelian inherited disorder-familial hypercholesterolemia.

Treatment with Volanesorsen, a 2'-O-Methoxyethyl-Modified Antisense Oligonucleotide Targeting APOC3 Evaluation of efficacy and safety of antisense inhibition of apolipoprotein C-III with volanesorsen in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Volanesorsen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibiting apoC-III transcription/translation that has been recently approved in Europe for Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) treatment. Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of apoC3, which reduces TG levels by 70-80% which has been shown also to reduce rates of pancreatitis and improve well-being in FCS and reduce TGs and improve insulin resistance in FPLD.  Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%.  CENT FINDINGS: Evidence is now emerging that volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting ApoCIII messenger RNA resulting in decreases in TG in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic dyslipidemia with type 2 diabetes giving support to the hypothesis that ApoCIII is a powerful inhibitor of LPL, and when reduced, endogenous clearance of TRLs can result in substantial reductions in TG levels. D OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of volanesorsen (ISIS 304801), a second-generation 2'-O-methoxyethyl chimeric antisense inhibitor of apolipoprotein (apo)C-III, on triglyceride (TG) levels and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. ariants. As such, apoC-III has been recognised as a potential therapeutic target for patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia with one of the most promising apoC-III-targeting drugs, volanesorsen, having recently progressed through Phase III  Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. Volanesorsen is an experimental antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits translation of Apo-CIII mRNA, thereby substantially lowering plasma levels of Apo-CIII and triglycerides. BACKGROUND: Volanesorsen, an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis, significantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including recurrent abdominal pain and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP).OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on patients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey open to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for ≥3 months in an open  In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic APOC3 mRNA with volanesorsen led to decreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels. Volanesorsen (Waylivra®), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL).

It is concluded that the sweating response during upright recovery is significantly modified by exercise intensity and may likely be influenced by the nonthermal baroreceptor reflex adjustments postexercise.  The purpose of this paper is to delineate the effects of training status, heat acclimation, environmental conditions and host factors on the sweating response to exercise. These results would suggest that at a given exercise intensity in subjects with a higher aerobic capacity body temperature is maintained with a lower sweating rate than that in subjects with a lower aerobic capacity.

Carriage prevalence of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in gallbladders of adult autopsy cases from Mozambique. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of S. Typhi in gallbladders among adult autopsy cases from Mozambique. Salmonella Extracellular Matrix Components Influence Biofilm Formation and Gallbladder Colonization. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever in humans, forms biofilms encapsulated by an extracellular matrix (ECM). Biofilms facilitate colonization and persistent infection in gallbladders of humans and mouse models of chronic carriage. In vitro modeling of gallbladder-associated Salmonella spp. colonization. The host-pathogen interactions occurring in the gallbladder during Salmonella Typhi colonization contribute to typhoid fever pathogenesis during the acute and chronic stages of disease. The gallbladder is the primary reservoir during chronic typhoid carriage. Salmonella chronic carriage: epidemiology, diagnosis, and gallbladder persistence. Gallbladder carriage has been demonstrated to be mediated by biofilm formation on gallstones and by intracellular persistence in the gallbladder epithelium of mice.  Gallbladder epithelium as a niche for chronic Salmonella carriage. This chronic state is highly associated with the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder of infected carriers upon which Salmonella can form robust biofilms.

58cbb98c02b8c60953000034	Which mutated enzyme is responsible for oculocutaneous 1 (OCA1)-type albinism?	An overview of oculocutaneous albinism: TYR gene mutations in five Colombian individuals To date, 230 mutations in the TYR gene have been reported as responsible for oculocutaneus albinism type 1 worldwide. TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase involved in the metabolic pathway of melanin synthesis. Mutations were identified in the TYR gene as responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in five Colombian individuals, and a new ophthalmic system was tested that corrected visual defects and symptoms in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism. Mutations in the gene for tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1, and more than 100 mutations of this gene have been identified. The Q402 allele has been associated with autosomal recessive ocular albinism when it is in trans with a tyrosinase gene mutation associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1. The disruption of tyrosinase trafficking occurs at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in OCA1 and OCA3, but at the post-Golgi level in OCA2.  Mutations at a single N-glycosylation sequon of tyrosinase have been reported to be responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type IA in humans, characterized by inactive tyrosinase and the total absence of pigmentation.  Mutations of the human tyrosinase gene associated with tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1).  Mutations in the human tyrosinase gene produce tyrosinase-related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1, MIM #203100). Tyrosinase is a copper containing enzyme and is responsible for catalyzing the rate limiting step in melanin biosynthesis, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopaquinone. We report 13 new mutations in the tyrosinase gene associated with OCA1A (without pigment) and OCA1B (with pigment) including 9 missense mutations (H19Q, R521, R77C, G97R, C289R, L312V, P313R, F340L and H404P), two nonsense mutations (W80X and R116X) and two frameshift mutations (53delG and 223 delG).  Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100). Mutations of the tyrosinase gene associated with a partial or complete loss of enzymatic activity are responsible for tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase gene, is genetically and biochemically the best understood type of albinism. Mutations in six genes have been reported to be responsible for different types of oculocutaneous and ocular albinism, including the tyrosinase gene (TYR) and OCA1 (MIM# 203100), the OCA2 gene and OCA2 (MIM# 203200), the tyrosinase-related protein-1 gene (TYRP1) and OCA3 (MIM# 203290), the HPS gene and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (MIM# 203300), the CHS gene (CHS1), and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (MIM# 214500), and the X-linked ocular albinism gene and OA1 (MIM#300500). Defects in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) cause a common type of OCA, known as oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in man may be caused by mutations within the tyrosinase gene (TYR) resulting in OCA1. Two novel tyrosinase (TYR) gene mutations with pathogenic impact on oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1).

Mutation analysis and prenatal gene diagnosis for the mutated tyrosinase (TYR) gene in two families with oculocutaneous albinism type I (OCA1).To define the fetus genotypes and gene mutation sites, the PCR and sequencing techniques were applied to amplify and analyze the regions of exon, exon-intron and promoter of TYR gene in probands and their parents of 2 families.The patient or proband of family 1 showed as a compound heterozygote with mutants R278X and 929insC Mutations in the gene for tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis, are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1, and more than 100 mutations of this gene have been identified TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase involved in the metabolic pathway of melanin synthesis.Mutations were identified in the TYR gene as responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in five Colombian individuals, and a new ophthalmic system was tested that corrected visual defects and symptoms in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism.Samples were taken from 5 individuals, four of whom belong to a single family, along with a fifth individual not related to the family Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme Disrupting mutations in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene are known to cause recessive albinisms in humans (oculocutaneous albinism Type 1; OCA1) and other species To explore the patients genotypes and the mutation spectrum of Tyrosinase (TYR) gene and the effects on protein structure and function in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1).The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques were applied to amplify and analyze the regions of exon, exonintron and promoter of TYR gene of 15 OCA1 probands and some of their parents Genetic analysis of oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) in Indian families: two novel frameshift mutations in the TYR Gene Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100).  Mutations of the tyrosinase gene associated with a partial or complete loss of enzymatic activity are responsible for tyrosinase related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1).  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene and presents with either complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes due to a defect in an enzyme involved in the production of melanin.  Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme.  OCA1 (MIM 203100) is associated with mutations of the TYR gene encoding tyrosinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin pigment) and accounts for approximately 40% of OCA worldwide.  Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes several reactions in the biosynthesis of melanin pigments and is deficient in patients with type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1). Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) results from mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which lead to partial or complete loss of activity of the corresponding enzyme. Mutations of the TYR gene lead to Oculocutaneous Albinism type 1 (OCA1), the most common type of albinism in humans (OMIM accession number 203100). In humans mutations in the TYR gene are associated with type 1 oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1) that leads to reduced or absent pigmentation of skin, hair and eye. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations of the tyrosinase gene (TYR). Tyrosinase (TYR) catalyzes the rate-limiting, first step in melanin production and its gene (TYR) is mutated in many cases of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1), an autosomal recessive cause of childhood blindness.

Therapeutic research for OCA1 has been hampered, in part, by the absence of purified, active, recombinant wild-type and mutant human enzymes.The intra-melanosomal domain of human tyrosinase (residues 19-469) and two OCA1B related temperature-sensitive mutants, R422Q and R422W were expressed in insect cells and produced in T. ni larvae. The tyrosinase gene family of proteins (tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2) regulate the type of eumelanin synthesized and mutations affecting them result in OCA1, OCA3, and slaty (in the murine system), respectively.

5fdb4264a43ad31278000023	What is a likely origin of intronless genes?	These highly conserved intronless genes were found to be involved in essential housekeeping functions. Genes without introns are a characteristic feature of prokaryotes, but there are still a number of intronless genes in eukaryotes. Part of intronless genes is derived from other intronless genes or multiexon genes in each species. Hexamer composition comparison allowed the definition of over- and under-represented motifs in intronless genes; surprisingly, experimental testing revealed that intron-lacking coding sequences are enriched rather than depleted in elements with splicing enhancement ability. ntronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function These results indicate that new SEGs are continuously and independently generated after species divergence over evolutionary time as evidenced by the phylogenetic results of single exon claudins genes. strong support for the idea that retrotransposition followed by tandem duplications is the most probable event that can explain the expansion of SEGs in eukaryotic organisms. More than half of SEGs identified in most of the species have at least one ortholog multiple exon gene in the same genome, which provides insight to their possible origin by retrotransposition  IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. Evolutionary analysis revealed that 2601 intronless genes conserved among the three domains of life and 2323 intronless genes that had no homology with genes of other species. Intronless genes can arise by germline retrotransposition of a cDNA originating as mRNA from an intron-containing source gene. We suggest that the intronless rho may have arisen through an ancient retrotransposition of a mature mRNA originating from errlo.	['retrotransposition']

602598201cb411341a0000af	What does bDMARD stand for?	Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment have several mechanisms of action.  In the present study we evaluated how systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy, safety and retention rate of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatment in rheumatic musculoskeletal disorders (RMDs). The introduction of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatments for various types of autoimmune arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy and ankylosing spondylitis, represents a new era of treatment for patients with a refractory response to conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). To establish in a global setting the relationships between countries' socioeconomic status (SES), measured biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)-usage and disease outcomes. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are engineered proteins with high affinity for various proinflammatory immune mediators to reduce inflammation and its sequelae in various rheumatic diseases. Biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are used in pregnant patients with rheumatic diseases. Biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) can be highly efficient in the treatment of various non-infectious uveitis entities. Biologic Disease-modifying Antirheumatic Drug (bDMARD)-induced Neutropenia: A Registry from a Retrospective Cohort of Patients with Rheumatic Diseases Treated with 3 Classes of Intravenous bDMARD. Indeed, worldwide clinical trials of TNF inhibiting biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept as well as the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, have demonstrated outstanding clinical efficacy and tolerable safety profiles, resulting in worldwide approval for using these bDMARDs to treat moderate to severe active RA in patients with an inadequate response to synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and tofacitinib, a targeted sDMARD, can be used to treat RA. Outcomes with Biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) in Older Patients Treated for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Objective Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) represent an important advance in alleviating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their effect on rheumatic airway disease (AD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) is still unclear.

58da1aa08acda34529000012	Which protein is associated with hyperemesis gravidarum during pregrancy?	Maternal smoking, BMI, parity, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight and hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms were associated with total hCG.  First trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free β-HCG levels in hyperemesis gravidarum. HG is associated with elevated levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG, and such changes are independent of serum indicators of thyroid and liver function. hCG promotes progesterone production by corpus luteal cells; promotes angiogenesis in uterine vasculature; promoted the fusion of cytotrophoblast cell and differentiation to make syncytiotrophoblast cells; causes the blockage of any immune or macrophage action by mother on foreign invading placental cells; causes uterine growth parallel to fetal growth; suppresses any myometrial contractions during the course of pregnancy; causes growth and differentiation of the umbilical cord; signals the endometrium about forthcoming implantation; acts on receptor in mother's brain causing hyperemesis gravidarum, and seemingly promotes growth of fetal organs during pregnancy.

514a51c2d24251bc0500005c	Which pituitary adenoma is common cause of infertility is women?	Prolactinoma is the most common secreting pituitary adenoma. It is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age and is common cause of infertility. Examination of the tissue excised by transsphenoidal excision of the mass showed a pituitary adenoma that stained strongly for FSH. RESULTS: Regular menses resumed soon after excision of the gonadotroph adenoma, followed by a spontaneous pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, multiple preovulatory follicles, and a persistently elevated serum estradiol concentration. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, occurring mostly in women and presenting most commonly with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Causes of hyperprolactinemia include physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic factors; pituitary adenoma is a common pathologic cause. Women may present with decreased libido, infertility, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and galactorrhea. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). Pregnancy in a woman with active acromegaly is very rare, because amenorrhea, due to hyperprolactinemia and disturbed pituitary gonadotropin secretion may cause infertility. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Results in 136 hyperprolactinaemic women who presented with infertility, amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and/or galactorrhoea are reported. There was radiographic evidence of pituitary microadenoma in 21 (15.4%) patients and 5 (3.7%) had macroadenoma. Patients with pituitary adenoma had a significantly higher (p less than 0.001) baseline serum prolactin level (182 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) than those with no adenoma (59.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml). All patients in the study were treated with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the patients with or without pituitary adenoma.

5a774fdcfaa1ab7d2e000008	Which protein is regulated by Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR)?	The p53-binding protein 1-Tudor-interacting repair regulator complex participates in the DNA damage response. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1. TIRR regulates 53BP1 by masking its histone methyl-lysine binding function. P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.

5aafc37afcf4565872000010	What is the function of HDAC  proteins?	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription.  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms Accumulating evidence has implicated histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation in diverse embryonic and adult tissues. The function of eukaryotic histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been extensively studied for its critical role in transcriptional regulation and carcinogenesis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression that require assembly into larger protein complexes for activity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDAC is a family of enzymes involved in deacetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. Gene expression is in part controlled by chromatin remodeling factors and the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. The latter process is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to remove acetyl groups from histone tails. This liberates positive charges on the histone tail and allows for tighter winding of DNA, preventing transcription factor binding and gene activation Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases catalyze the reversible acetylation of histones and nonhistone substrates to control the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of normal and tumor cells Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify core histones and participate in large regulatory complexes that both suppress and enhance transcription Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins. The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones.

56b397a98525abca1e000003	What is the lipid droplet used for in the cell?	Eukaryotic cells store excess fatty acids as neutral lipids, predominantly triacylglycerols and sterol esters, in organelles termed lipid droplets (LDs) that bulge out from the endoplasmic reticulum.  Lipid droplets (LD) are spherical cellular inclusion devoted to lipids storage. Cells store fatty acids (FAs) as triacylglycerol and package them into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs).  Lipid droplets are found in all cell types Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous and physiologically active organelles regulating storage and mobilization of lipids in response to metabolic demands.  Lipids accumulate in spherical cellular inclusions called lipid droplets (LDs) whose sizes range from fraction to one hundred of micrometers in adipocytes.	['lipid storage and lipid mobilization']
58b6978822d300530900000a	Which disease the London mutation involved in?	In the present study, we used a new training paradigm in the intelliCage automatic behavioral assessment system to investigate cognitive functions of the transgenic mice harboring London mutation of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP.V717I).  The novel approach to study the transgenic mice cognitive abilities presented in this paper offers new insight into cognitive dysfunctions of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model. One major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the massive loss of synapses that occurs at an early clinical stage of the disease. In this study, we characterize alterations in spine density and the expression of synapse-associated immediate early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) in the hippocampal CA1 regions of two different amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines before plaque development and their connection to performance in hippocampus-dependent memory tests. The density of mushroom-type spines was reduced by 34% in the basal dendrites proximal to the soma of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5.5-month-old Tg2576 mice, carrying the Swedish mutation, compared with wild-type littermates. A similar reduction of 42% was confirmed in the same region of 8-month-old APP/Lo mice, carrying the London mutation. The London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. We describe 2 Italian families showing the missense mutation in exon 17 of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (Val717Ile), known as London mutation. In 1 family, this mutation was responsible for AD in 3 out of 7 siblings and it is also present in a fourth sibling who has only shown signs of executive dysfunction so far. Two subjects of the other family with AD diagnosis were carriers of the same mutation. A pathological hallmark in the brain of an AD patient is extracellular amyloid plaques formed by accumulated beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), a metabolic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Studies have revealed a strong genetic linkage in the early-onset familial form (<60 years old) of AD. For example, some mutant APPs are transmitted dominantly and are segregated with inheritance of early onset AD. These mutants facilitate Abeta production. The "Swedish" mutations (APP(SW)) and the "London" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants.  The sequences that are effective to silence APP(SW) and APP(LON) as identified in this study may be useful in both in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate the pathophysiological role of APP(SW) and APP(LON) in AD development. Here, we show ASP-RNAi against the Swedish- and London-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) variants related to familial Alzheimer's disease using two reporter alleles encoding the Photinus and Renilla luciferase genes and carrying mutant and wild-type allelic sequences in their 3'-untranslated regions.  Transgenic mice over-expressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP, 695 isoform) bearing a mutation associated with Alzheimer's disease (V642I, so-called London mutation, hereafter APPLd2) and wild-type controls were studied at age periods (3 and 10 months) prior to the overt development of neuritic amyloid plaques. The "Swedish" mutations (APP(SW)) and the "London" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants. Allele-specific silencing of Alzheimer's disease genes: the amyloid precursor protein genes with Swedish or London mutations. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene were the first to be recognized as a cause of Alzheimers disease (AD).We describe 2 Italian families showing the missense mutation in exon 17 of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (Val717Ile), known as London mutation.In 1 family, this mutation was responsible for AD in 3 out of 7 siblings and it is also present in a fourth sibling who has only shown signs of executive dysfunction so far The London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimers disease We analyzed the cytotoxic mechanisms of the London-type AbetaPP mutant, V642I-AbetaPP, in primary cortical neurons utilizing an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer system. We demonstrate that the APP-London and PS1 mutations have additive effects on the increased secretion of betaA4(1-42) relative to betaA4(1-40), indicating that both mutations operate independently. Pathogenic mutations in APP at codon 717 (APP "London") lead to an increased proportion of Abeta 1-42 being produced and secreted. The "Swedish" mutations (APP(SW)) and the "London" mutation (APP(LON)) are examples of these mutants. Allele-specific silencing of Alzheimer's disease genes: the amyloid precursor protein genes with Swedish or London mutations.

The London APP mutation (Val717Ile) associated with early shifting abilities and behavioral changes in two Italian families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Such cleavage is promoted by the Swedish and London mutations (APPSwe/Lon) inside the APP gene. We also show that the Swedish and London mutations reduce the amount of APP in the lysosome. This rapid transit to the lysosome is blocked by the presence of either the London or Swedish mutations.	["Alzheimer's Disease", 'AD']
52c7311903868f1b0600001d	How many different mutations have been associated with Muenke syndrome?	Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.  The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis.  The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.   Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred.  Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).

5a9ac4e81d1251d03b000011	Which brain tumors does neuroligin-3 promote?	An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.

5c701f4f7c78d69471000060	Which disease is Dasatinib used to treat?	Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia Our results suggest that the characteristics of complete molecular response on dasatinib treatment may be similar to that achieved with imatinib, at least in patients with adverse disease features. Dasatinib as salvage therapy for steroid refractory and imatinib resistant or intolerant sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. Furthermore, two recent studies showed dasatinib to be effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of cells from leukemia patients with c-Cbl RING finger and linker domain mutations Thus we conclude that dasatinib may not be an appropriate therapy for leukemia patients with c-Cbl mutations  With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. Minimal residual disease-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line dasatinib combined with chemotherapy for adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  We assessed the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line incorporation of dasatinib (100 mg once daily) into chemotherapy alternatively for adults with Ph-positive ALL. This dasatinib-based protocol was effective for achieving a good quality molecular response and durable DFS in adults with Ph-positive ALL NKG2D gene polymorphisms are associated with disease control of chronic myeloid leukemia by dasatinib.

5a7428090384be9551000001	What can be predicted with the Wells criteria?	Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was performed at a tertiary care, academic medical center ED with approximately 60 000 annual visits and included all patients who were suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) and who underwent CT pulmonary angiography between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Each CT order for pulmonary angiography was exposed to CDS on the basis of the Wells criteria.  Incremental diagnostic quality gain of CTA over V/Q scan in the assessment of pulmonary embolism by means of a Wells score Bayesian model: results from the ACDC collaboration. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan in the assessment of pulmonary embolism (PE) by means of a Bayesian statistical model.METHODS: Wells criteria defined pretest probability.   As her immediate risk of VTE was low (Wells criteria), she was advised mechanical measures to prevent VTE along with continuation of rivaroxaban therapy which had already been prescribed for her avalvular atrial fibrillation.   For ED patients aged 18+years with suspected PE, CTPE use and yield were compared 19months pre- and 32months post-implementation of CDS intervention based on the Wells criteria, provided at the time of CTPE order, deployed in April 2012.  Correlation between the Wells score and the Quanadli index in patients with pulmonary embolism. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Determining clinical probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) with Wells scoring system is the first step towards diagnosis of PE. Clinical probability of PE was determined according to the Wells and modified Wells scoring system. CONCLUSION: Modified Wells criteria have high sensitivity but low specificity in PE diagnostics.  METHODS: This was a prospective investigation of the sensitivity of multidetector CTPA among patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE according to the Wells criteria. When Wells Criteria were dichotomized into pulmonary embolism-unlikely (n=88, 66%) or pulmonary embolism-likely (n=46, 34%), the prevalence was 3% and 28%, respectively. When Wells Criteria were trichotomized into low pretest probability (n=59, 44%), moderate pretest probability (n=61, 46%), or high pretest probability (n=14, 10%), the pulmonary embolism prevalence was 2%, 15%, and 43%, respectively. The immunoturbidimetric and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay d -dimer assays had similar sensitivities (94%) and specificities (45% versus 46%).<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Wells Criteria have a moderate to substantial interrater agreement and reliably risk stratify pretest probability in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.<br> Prospective validation of Wells Criteria in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

5503133ae9bde6963400001d	Which gene is most commonly associated with severe congenital and cyclic neutropenia?	Neutrophil elastase gene (ELANE) mutations are responsible for the majority of cases of severe congenital neutropenia (CN) and cyclic neutropenia (CyN) We screened CN (n = 395) or CyN (n = 92) patients for ELANE mutations and investigated the impact of mutations on mRNA expression, protein expression, and activity. We found 116 different mutations in 162 (41%) CN patients and 26 in 51 (55%) CyN patients, 69 of them were novel Cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia in patients with a shared ELANE mutation and paternal haplotype Cyclic neutropenia (CN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) are disorders of neutrophil production that differ markedly in disease severity. Mutations of the ELANE gene (the symbol recently replacing ELA2) are considered largely responsible for most cases of CN and SCN, but specific mutations are typically associated with one or the other One patient with CN had the same S97L ELANE mutation as seven patients with the SCN phenotype Three familial cases of each of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CN) in addition to 3 sporadic cases of SCN were analyzed for neutrophil elastase (Ela2) gene mutation Three cases of familial SCN (P13L, R52P, and S97L), 2 of familial CN (W212stop and P110L), and 1 of sporadic SCN (V72M) were shown to have heterozygous mutations in the Ela2 gene Recent studies have elucidated a role for the unfolded protein response in mediating the pathogenic effects of ELA2 mutations, the most common mutation in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) as well as cyclic neutropenia Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. Mutations of the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE) are responsible for most cases of SCN and cyclic neutropenia (CN), a related but milder disorder of granulopoiesis Heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (ELA2) have been associated with cyclic neutropenia (CN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). The observation that mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene, which cause cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia, are associated with protease maldistribution gives some clue as to the potential importance of inhibitor proteins. All cases of cyclic neutropenia and most cases of severe congenital neutropenia result from heterozygous germline mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase, ela2. Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene were identified in all patients with cyclic neutropenia and most of the patients with severe congenital neutropenia.

5545186cbf90a13052000002	Which gene strand is targeted by transcription-coupled repair (TCR)?	Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is the major pathway involved in the removal of UV-induced photolesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. transcription-coupled repair (TCR) provides faster repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. there are two sub-pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the global genome (gg) NER and the transcription-coupled repair (TCR). TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. transcription-coupled repair (TCR) since targets for DNA damage are situated on the transcribed or coding strand of DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), which removes a variety of helix-distorting lesions from DNA, is initiated by two distinct DNA damage-sensing mechanisms. Transcription Coupled Repair (TCR) removes damage from the active strand of transcribed genes Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that allows for the enhanced repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. Transcription coupled repair (TCR) is a nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway that is dedicated to repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a pathway dedicated to the removal of damage from the template strands of actively transcribed genes. Although the detailed mechanism of TCR is not yet understood, it is believed to be triggered when a translocating RNA polymerase is arrested at a lesion or unusual structure in the DNA. Among these is a process called transcription-coupled repair (TCR) that catalyzes the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes, often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart. These results suggest that UV treatment results in an induced repair of UV-damaged DNA in the transcribed strand of an active gene in XP-C and normal cells through an enhancement of TCR or a mechanism which involves the TCR pathway. TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a universal sub-pathway of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system that is limited to the transcribed strand of active structural genes. NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes. Transcription coupled repair (TCR), a special sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), removes transcription blocking lesions rapidly from the transcribing strand of active genes. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) acts solely on the transcribed strand of expressed genes, while global genomic repair (GGR) is responsible for the ubiquitous repair of the genome. In addition to the recognition and excision of DNA damage throughout the genome (GGR), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR), for recognizing some types of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of genes in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes. TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that acts specifically on lesions in the transcribed strand of expressed genes. The blockage of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) at a DNA damage site on the transcribed strand triggers a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), which rapidly removes DNA damage on the transcribed strand of the expressed gene and allows the resumption of transcription. It has been previously shown that disruption of RAD26 in yeast strain W303-1B results in a strain that is deficient in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the preferential repair of the transcribed strand of an expressed gene over the non-transcribed strand and the rest of the genome. The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes A dedicated excision repair pathway, termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), targets the removal of DNA lesions from transcribed strands of expressed genes NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes Transcription coupled repair (TCR) is a nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway that is dedicated to repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is generally observed as more rapid or more efficient removal of certain types of DNA damage from the transcribed strands of expressed genes compared with the nontranscribed strands In addition to the recognition and excision of DNA damage throughout the genome (GGR), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR), for recognizing some types of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of genes in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells	['the transcribed strand']
6027f8ae1cb411341a0000ed	Which network analysis method can you use for prioritization of metabolic disease genes?	metPropagate: network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes. Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis is imperative. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 11 patients with both CNS and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of UM data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We valida metPropagate: network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization.

(Funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation and others; MR CLEAN Netherlands Trial Registry number, NTR1804, and Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN10888758.). MR CLEAN, a multicenter randomized clinical trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.  In our view, a rational and ethical approach would now be to treat quickly with IV rtPA and when possible, refer and include in new randomized clinical trials that compare intra-arterial treatment with standard care, such as MR CLEAN or BASICS in the Netherlands.

5fdb2e74a43ad3127800000d	Which master regulator drives liver development?	The molecular mechanisms by which hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4α regulates fetal liver development have not been fully elucidated. SNAT4 functions downstream of HNF4α and plays significant roles in liver development through mechanisms of amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. Here we use mouse genetics to address the role of UPF2, a core NMD component, in the development, function and regeneration of the liver.  Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF-4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4α) is a well-established master regulator of liver development and function.  Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4α) is a well established master regulator of liver development and function.  l-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) plays a critical role in regulating a large number of key genes essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics, metabolic wastes, and nutrients. The expres PAX6), a master regulator of pancreas development overexpressed in colon cancer, cooperated with HNF1α to induce P2-HNF4α but antagonized HNF4α in HNF4A-AS1 expression. Thus, PAX6 may  As a well-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 As a well-established master regulator of liver development and function, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) plays a critical role in regulating a large number of key genes essential for the metabolism of xenobiotics, metabolic wastes, and nutrients. Herein I provide comprehensive review on the regulation of expression and transcriptional activity of HNF4α, and how HNF4α crosstalks with diverse extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways to regulate genes essential in liver pathophysiology. HNF4α appears to play a central role in orchestrating the transduction of extracellular hormonal signaling and intracellular stress/nutritional signaling onto transcriptional changes in the liver. There have been a few reviews on the regulation of drug metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and inflammation by HNF4α. However, the knowledge on how the expression and transcriptional activity of HNF4α is modulated remains scattered. The expression and activity of HNF4α is regulated by diverse hormonal and signaling pathways such as growth hormone, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, insulin, transforming growth factor-β, estrogen, and cytokines. Using in vivo mouse liver development as a model, we identified thousands of enhancers that are bound by the master regulators HNF4A and FOXA2 in a differentiation-dependent manner, subject to chromatin remodeling, and associated with differentially expressed target genes. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a master regulator of development and function of digestive tissues. The transcriptional regulation by these HNFs, which form a hierarchical and cooperative network, is both essential for hepatocyte differentiation during mammalian liver development and also crucial for metabolic regulation and liver function. Studies on the transcriptional regulatory elements of genes expressed in hepatocytes have identified several liver-enriched transcriptional factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, HNF-6 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein families, which are key components of the differentiation process for the fully functional liver. Among these liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF-4 is likely to act the furthest upstream as a master gene in transcriptional cascade and interacts with other liver-enriched transcriptional factors to stimulate hepatocyte-specific gene transcription.

5895f18ce370baff39000001	Which method is used for prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions?	 In this work we present a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis. Our work combines both analytical and experimental techniques to show that SSCprofiler is a highly accurate tool which can be used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates in the human genome.

A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. Systemic administration of isradipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of L-type channels, forces dopaminergic neurons in rodents to revert to a juvenile, Ca(2+)-independent mechanism to generate autonomous activity. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. What distinguishes snail and mammalian L-type channels is a difference in dihydropyridine sensitivity: 100 nM isradipine exhibits a significant block of mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 currents without effect on snail LCa(v)1 currents. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. During control stimulation of the presynaptic GABAergic neuron at 40 Hz for 1-2 s, DeltaF/F(0) increased rapidly to a peak value and started to decline shortly after the train ended, returning to baseline within 10-20 s. The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist.

Effects of isradipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker on permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. Omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N type calcium channel antagonist and flunarizine, a nonselective T-type calcium channel antagonist were without effect. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.	['antagonizes', 'blocks']

Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the complete or partial absence of an X chromosome in affected women Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder caused by complete or partial X chromosome monosomy that manifests various clinical features depending on the karyotype and on the genetic background of affected girls CONTEXT: Turner syndrome (TS) is the most common genetic problem affecting women and occurs when an X chromosome is completely deleted, portions of an X chromosome are deleted, or chromosomal mosaicism occurs.  Turner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder that results from the loss of the entire or a part of the X-chromosome and occurs in 1/2,500 female births. Women with Turner's syndrome (TS), who lack a complete X-chromosome, show an impairment in remembering faces and in classifying "fear" in face images. The proposition that finger print variability between individuals might be reduced by the absence of an X-chromosome in Turner's syndrome was rejected.

Do depression and anxiety reduce the likelihood of remission in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis? To investigate the predictive value of baseline depression/anxiety on the likelihood of achieving joint remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as well as the associations between baseline depression/anxiety and the components of the remission criteria at follow-up. Rate of depression was higher in patients with PsA compared to non-PsA patients. The rate of suicidal behaviors was similar between the two cohorts. Over the past decade, multiple studies have shown that not only is there an association between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, depression, and substance abuse, but psoriasis patients also have a higher incidence of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Psoriasis is a chronic disease that affects more than the skin. It has an impact on every facet of an individual's life and is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, depression, anxiety and other immune-related conditions, such as Crohn's disease.  We found an increased risk of depression in US women with psoriasis compared with those without psoriasis.  The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of varianc Furthermore, obesity and psychological diseases such as depression and anxiety disorders are linked with psoriasis and play a central role in its management.  Recommendations were synthesized into 19 final recommendations ranging mainly from grade C to D, and relating to a large spectrum of comorbidities observed in clinical practice: CVD, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, infections, and cancer. Level of agreement ranged from 80.9% to 95.8%.CONCLUSION: These practical evidence-based recommendations can guide management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO and optimize outcome Anxiety and depressive symptoms and illness perceptions in psoriatic arthritis and associations with physical health-related quality of life.  The rate of depression and anxiety is significantly higher in patients with PsA than in those with PsC. Depression and anxiety are associated with disease-related factors.

593fe5c270f9fc6f0f000021	How many PML isoforms exist in the human genome?	The PML isoforms that are most sensitive to virus infection correspond closely to those which have recently been identified as being covalently conjugated to PIC1. Using a panel of different PML isoforms, we demonstrate specific co-localization between the E6 proteins and PML isoforms I-IV, but not with PML isoforms V and VI.  PML isoforms I and II participate in PML-dependent restriction of HSV-1 replication.  We report that individual expression of PML isoforms I and II partially reverses the increase in ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation that occurs in PML-depleted cells. PML, the organizer of nuclear bodies (NBs), is expressed in several isoforms designated PMLI to VII which differ in their C-terminal region due to alternative splicing of a single gene. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay in living cells, we found that As₂O₃ enhanced the SUMOylation and interaction with RNF4 of nuclear PML isoforms (I to VI) PML is the structural component of PML nuclear bodies and has several nuclear splice isoforms that share a common N-terminal region but differ in their C termini. Several PML isoforms are generated from a single PML gene by alternative splicing.  Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region.  However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive	['7, designated I to VII', 'I-VII']

How BACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arth METHODS: Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine a low disease activity threshold--a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) value--for the decision to maintain unchanged disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients, based on expert opinion. Comparison of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with ESR (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) & Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data with 3 measures (RAPID3) for assessing disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at initial presentation. We assessed achievement of remission as defined by Boolean criteria, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) and determined the components that limit patients in SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission from achieving Boolean remission. METHODS: Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scores, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) were calculated using data from tocilizumab trials in patients with RA in whom disease had remained active despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. OBJECTIVE: We used the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) articular domain to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABA) on articular involvement in primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS). METHOD: The clinical data of 189 consecutive RA patients, including RAPID3 questionnaire, Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count (DAS28), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and ultrasonography of hand and wrist joints were collected. Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-remission has not been included among American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism definitions, because of its association with significant residual disease activity, partly due to high weighting of acute-phase reactants (APR). OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of components of the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) [tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient's general health (GH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)] on the total DAS28 score, and overlapping of the 4 individual components in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low, moderate, or high disease activity. This study investigates if, and to what extent, non-adherence to treatment would lead to a higher 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) in the first year after diagnosis. Radiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed. Tender-/swollen-joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score 28-ESR (DAS28-ESR), DAS28-CRP, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and DAS28-monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (DAS28-MCP-1) scores were obtained every 3 months. METHOD: All patients were naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and in low or moderate Disease Activity Score of 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS)28-CRP). We compared RA disease activity using 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and its components, and EULAR response, between patients with and without AITD, using logistic regression. BACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid art BACKGROUND: The 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) combines scores on a 28-tender and swollen joint count (TJC28 and SJC28), a patient-reported measure for general health (GH), and an inflammatory marker (either the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or the C-reactive protein [CRP]) into a composite measure of disease activity in rheumatoid art OBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) is a key measure in clinical practice and clini OBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score including 28 joints (DAS28) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were developed in order to provide a quantifiable measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA OBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been increasingly used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arth OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the application of Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) to assess joint involvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).METHODS: Sixty-nine SLE patients, complaining of joint symptoms, and 44 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pa OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of components of the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) [tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient's general health (GH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)] on the total DAS28 score, and overlapping of the 4 individual components in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low, moderate, or high disease activity.METHODS: The effect of each component was studied in the FIN-RACo trial patients at 6 months and in a "theoretical model," where each component of the DAS28 ranged as follows: TJC and SJC from 0 to 28, GH from 0 to 100, and ESR from 1 to 100, while the other 3 compo OBJECTIVE: To assess the factorial structure of the Disease Activity Score including a 28-joint count (DAS28) if applied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).METHODS: DAS28 values from 85 consecutive PsA outpatients and 2 RA patient cohorts comprising 85 patients Disease activity assessment of rheumatoid arthritis in daily practice: validity, internal consistency, reliability and congruency of the Disease Activity Score including 28 joints (DAS28) compared with the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI).

533c390bc45e13371400000b	What is an acceptable sequence coverage(depth) required for human whole-exome sequencing?	A total of 5.97 Gb clean data were generated for the two samples, achieving a mean depth of coverage of 31.96 and 32.88 for the AAA and normal samples, respectively. The 1.7 Mb targeted regions were sequenced with a coverage ranged from 32× to 45× for the 28 genes. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 87 HCCs and matched normal adjacent tissues to an average coverage of 59× We performed WES (mean coverage approximately 40×) on 10 trios comprised of unaffected parents and a child with sporadic epilepsy characterized by difficult-to-control seizures and some combination of developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, cognitive impairment, or motor deficits. Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard bioinformatics tools. Whole-exome sequencing achieved a high degree of coverage such that approximately 97% of targeted bases were represented by more than 10 base reads; AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5-30×) and sample size (20-10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans).  Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed. mtDNA genome coverage varied depending on the mtDNA:nuclear blend ratio, where a 1:100 ratio provided optimal dual-genome coverage with 10X coverage for over 97.5% of all targeted nuclear regions and 1,000X coverage for 99.8% of the mtDNA genome. mtDNA mutations were reliably detected to at least an 8% heteroplasmy level, as discriminated both from sequencing errors and potential contamination from nuclear mtDNA transcripts (Numts). Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than 120× Long-PCR targeting was more efficient with up to 94% of USH gene regions displaying an overall coverage higher than 25×, whereas whole exome sequencing yielded a similar coverage for only 50% of those regions. WES reads covered 91% of the target capture region (of size 37.2 MB) with an average coverage of 65×. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold. The specificity of exome enrichment was approximately 80% with 95.6% even coverage of the 34 Mb target region at an average sequencing depth of 33-fold We generated over 4.7 GB of mappable sequence to a 125X read coverage per sample. By massively parallel sequencing of a primary hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (36× coverage) and matched lymphocytes (>28× coverage) from the same individual, we identified more than 11,000 somatic substitutions of the tumor genome that showed predominance of T>C/A>G transition and a decrease of the T>C substitution on the transcribed strand, suggesting preferential DNA repair. Whole-exome sequencing at a higher sequence depth (>76× coverage) revealed a TSC1 nonsense substitution in a subpopulation of the tumor cells.  We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56×. We performed medium-depth (8×) whole exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI >27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1) Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50� using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed.

52f509512059c6d71c000020	What is the mode of inheritance of short QT syndrome?	Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested.  From 1993, the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) came to our attention, as a new inherited "electrical disease" associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. Mutations of Ikr, Iks, Ikl channels cause dysfunctional Iks, Ikr, Ikl channels with an increase in the net outward K current leading to shortening of repolarization. This in turn leads to a shorter QT interval on the ECG and shorter atrial and ventricular refractory periods with increased susceptibility to VF and AF. There seems to be an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.	['autosomal dominant mode of inheritance']

Besides, to study its scores' evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in relation to other resilience questionnaires (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 10-item version, Situated Subjective Resilience Questionnaire for Adults and Resiliency Questionnaire for Adults) and to variables such as emotions (Modified Differential Emotions Scale), coping (Person-situation Coping Questionnaire for Adults), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). METHOD: A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors. After correcting for multiple comparisons, no significant effects were observed on any of the outcomes among the NHW sample; however, within the NHB sample, significant gene × environment (G × E) interactions were observed for lifetime PTSD (P = .0029) and PTSD symptom severity (P = .0009). In each case, the APOE ε4 allele had no effect on the outcomes when combat exposure was low; however, when combat exposure was high, an additive effect was observed such that ε4 homozygotes exposed to high levels of combat reported the highest rates of PTSD (92%) and the worst symptom severity scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale (M = 79.5) Early prognostic screening for posttraumatic stress disorder with the Davidson Trauma Scale and the SPAN. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma. The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Davidson trauma scale (DTS-S) and to determine the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a non-clinical random sample of prison inmates.Probabilistic samples of 1,179 inmates from 26 penal institutions in Puerto Rico were selected using a multistage sampling design Remission in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): effects of sertraline as assessed by the Davidson Trauma Scale, Clinical Global Impressions and the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma.  Symptoms were assessed at sequential time points by the Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP), a clinician interview based assessment, and a self-report scale, the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS).  The present study focused on platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentration and symptoms of comorbid depression in war veterans with or without PTSD.PTSD and depression were evaluated using Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Davidson Trauma Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Although rates of trauma and PTSD are higher in those with bipolar disorder than in the general population, little is known about differences across bipolar subtypes.Using the NIMH STEP-BD dataset (N=3158), this study evaluated whether there were baseline differences in the prevalence of PTSD between participants with bipolar disorder I (BDI) and bipolar disorder II (BDII), using the MINI and the Davidson Trauma Scale. We also investigated the interaction between the genetic variants to determine whether these variables and the interactions between the variables influenced the severity of PTSD symptoms.PTSD symptoms were quantitatively assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in 150 participants from an at-risk South African population. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). The Davidson Trauma Scale was completed at 1 (n = 145), 6 (n = 106), 12 (n = 94), and 24 (n = 66) months postdischarge to assess symptoms of PTSD. The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a validated, 17-item, brief global assessment scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) in a sample of 56 patients admitted to an emergency room of a general hospital, and assessment of PTSD symptoms in relatives of the patients.

52f11b922059c6d71c000004	Which signalling pathway is involved in Tuberous Sclerosis?	Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by mutation in either Tsc1 or Tsc2 genes that leads to the hyper activation of the mTOR pathway, a key signalling pathway for synaptic plasticity.  Tuberous sclerosis, caused by germline mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, is associated with aberrant upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, resulting in growth of tumours, including renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant inheritance and is caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC1/2 genes play a fundamental role in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of the GTPase activity of Rheb. TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutation in either of two genes: TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin. Both proteins form a complex inhibiting mTOR signalling pathway and thus regulate cell size and proliferation. Recent findings from this laboratory and others suggests that the tumour suppressor complex made of two proteins TSC1/hamartin and TSC2/tuberin, acts as a negative regulator of mTOR/S6K1 signalling. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are genetically linked to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, which can lead to severe pathological consequences, including mental retardation, epilepsy and autism, as well as cardiac, pulmonary and renal failure. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex normally acts on Rheb to mediate mTOR/S6K1-signalling. Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) represents a unique group of small GTPases and shares moderate sequence identity with the Ras/Rap subfamily. It acts downstream of nutrient signalling as the direct target of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and upstream of mTOR/S6K1/4EBP in the insulin-signalling pathway. Recent studies suggest that the tuberous sclerosis complex Tsc1-Tsc2 may couple insulin signalling to Tor activity Our genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that Rheb functions downstream of the tumour suppressors Tsc1 (tuberous sclerosis 1)-Tsc2 in the TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling pathway to control growth Our results indicate activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin metabolic pathway in tuberous sclerosis lesions, which contributes to their growth. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hamartoma syndrome whose causative genes (TSC1 and TSC2) were identified 5 and 9 years ago respectively. Recent studies in Drosophila have pinpointed a critical function for the DrosophilaTSC1/TSC2 homologues in the regulation of cell size. Epistasis experiments and a variety of biochemical studies that followed have indicated a critical function for these proteins in the highly conserved PI-3-kinase-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway. Here, we show that tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) and Tsc2, tumour suppressors that are responsible for the tuberous sclerosis syndrome, antagonize this amino acid-TOR signalling pathway. We show that Tsc1 and Tsc2 can physically associate with TOR and function upstream of TOR genetically. In Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells, loss of Tsc1 and Tsc2 results in a TOR-dependent increase of S6K activity.

53147b52e3eabad021000015	What is a benefit of being g6PD-deficient?	A central position of the PPP for malaria parasites is supported by the fact that human G6PD deficiency protects to a certain degree from malaria infections.  The beneficial effect of thalassemia minor, sickle-cell trait, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on survival of malaria infection may well be due to the shared feature of enhanced oxidative stress. This may inhibit parasite growth, enhance uptake of infected RBCs by spleen macrophages, and/or cause less cytoadherence of the infected cells to capillary endothelium.  In conclusion, genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with RBC traits in African-Americans.  G6PD deficiency has been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity. G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P. vivax predominates. Severe G6PDd was associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions. and G6PD (Xq28)-were associated (P ≤ 1 × 10(-6)) with RBC traits in the discovery cohort	['There is evidence of increased resistance to malaria.']

Iodothyronine deiodinase in vitro activity studies in the chicken showed the presence of type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinase activity in both liver and kidney. In embryonic chicken liver (ECL) two types of iodothyronine deiodinases are expressed: D1 and D3. In liver homogenates, D1 activity was not correlated with age, whereas D3 activity showed a strong negative correlation with age (r -0.84), with high D3 activities in preterm infants and (except in 1 infant of 35 weeks) absent D3 activity in full-term infants. In microsomes, D1 activities amounted to 4.3-60 pmol/min/mg protein in fetal livers and to 170-313 pmol/min/mg protein in adult livers, whereas microsomal D3 activities were 0.15-1.45 pmol/min/mg protein in fetuses and <0.1 pmol/min/mg protein in all but one adult. high D1 and D3 activities in fetal human liver, and high D1 and mostly absent D3 activities in adult human liver.

These observations indicate that OTX2 and NANOG can form a negative feedback circuitry to regulate the pluripotency of porcine iPS cells. Jδ retained the pluripotency gene-inducing ability of Sδ when used alone and in combination with Sδ; a notable increase in the pluripotency gene expression was observed. Interestingly, Jδ significantly induced the expression of HDAC8-controlled Otx2 and Lhx1. Otx2 is an intrinsic determinant of the embryonic stem cell state and is required for transition to a stable epiblast stem cell condition. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, Otx2 is required for ESC transition into EpiSCs and, subsequently, to stabilize the EpiSC state by suppressing, in pluripotent cells, the mesendoderm-to-neural fate switch in cooperation with BMP4 and Fgf2. We propose that Otx2 is a novel intrinsic determinant controlling the functional integrity of ESCs and EpiSCs. Pig iPSCs, which lacked expression of specific naïve state markers KLF2/4/5 and TBX3, but expressed the primed state markers of Otx2 and Fabp7, share defining features with human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs.  Here we show that OTX2 is highly expressed at the onset of rosette formation, when rosettes comprise no more than 3-5 cells, and that its expression precedes that of established markers of early neuronal differentiation.  Otx2 and Oct4 drive early enhancer activation during embryonic stem cell transition from naive pluripotency. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 directly stimulated the expression of OTX2, RX1 and SIX3 in HDFs and iPSCs.  A key factor in this process is Otx2, which is upregulated during the early stages of this transition and ultimately recruits Oct4 to a different set of enhancers Induction of Otx2 causes the reorganization of acetylated Oct4 and results in the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Regulation of Oct4 by SirT1 may link stem cell development to environmental conditions, and it may provide strategies to manipulate epiblast cell state. In hESCs, ZNF207 partners with master pluripotency TFs to govern self-renewal and pluripotency while simultaneously controlling commitment of cells towards ectoderm through direct regulation of neuronal TFs, including OTX2.   Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts.  We observed that the expression of Lin28 genes is transiently induced soon after the exit of ESCs from the naive ground state and that this induction is due to the Hmga2-dependent engagement of Otx2 with enhancers present at both Lin28 gene loci. Functional Antagonism between OTX2 and NANOG Specifies a Spectrum of Heterogeneous Identities in Embryonic Stem Cells Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Our results illuminate regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency and suggest that the capacity of transcription factors such as Otx2 and Oct4 to pioneer new enhancer sites is highly context dependent. Taken together, our results establish readily efficient and safe protocols to produce iPSCs and iPSC-derived RPE cells, and underline that the reactivation of anterior neural transcription factor OTX2, eye field transcription factor RX1 and SIX3 in iPSCs is a feature of pluripotency acquisition and predetermines the potential of RPE differentiation. In summary, this study demonstrates that there is a regulatory network mediated by miR-1343, in which downregulation of OTX2 by miR-1343 can elevate the expression of pluripotent genes that were then sustain the pluripotency of piPSCs. Molecular network of miR-1343 regulates the pluripotency of porcine pluripotent stem cells via repressing OTX2 expression. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Importantly, the rise of OTX2 expression in these cells coincides with the down-regulation of the pluripotency marker OCT4. cESCs propagated in 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naïve pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). The transcription factor Otx2 acts as a negative switch in the regulation of transition from naive to primed pluripotency in mouse pluripotent stem cells n 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naïve pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). Differential phosphoryla h core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency.

The distinct r present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network.

Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2.	['formative pluripotency']

Positive activity by the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) was identified in cell extracts of Escherichia coli expressing a sequence-optimized hTERT gene The regulatory role of PCDH10 in telomerase activity was confirmed by a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, and the biological functions of it were characterized by in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. TRAP assay is a standard method for detecting telomerase activity in various tissues or cell lines.  Telomerase activity was determined by TRAP assay. The telomerase activity was evaluated by TRAP assay.  The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) represents an easy and rapid method for detection of telomerase activity in cells. A non-telomeric TS primer is extended by telomerase in the first step followed by the PCR amplification of the products. The PCR step renders this protocol very sensitive to detect telomerase activity at the single cell level making it compatible with the analysis of tumor samples. When run on a polyacrylamide gel, the PCR product is a characteristic ladder of bands due to the repetitive nature of telomeric DNA sequence. The densitometric analysis of the ladder allows the TRAP assay to be used for comparative quantification of telomerase activity in different samples. Telomerase enzyme activity can be detected in whole cell lysates by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method referred to as the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP).

Reevaluation of the Critically Ill Patients With Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus by Using Salzburg Consensus Criteria. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Salzburg Consensus Criteria (SCC) for determining the prognosis of critically ill patients with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that SCC is highly compatible with clinical practice in the decision for treatment of patients with NCSE.  Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE. EEGs recorded in the ICU were classified using the Salzburg criteria for NCSE. Diagnostic accuracy of the Salzburg EEG criteria for non-convulsive status epilepticus: a retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Several EEG criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), but none have been clinically validated. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the EEG criteria proposed by a panel of experts at the fourth London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus in Salzburg, 2013 (henceforth called the Salzburg criteria). Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE.

The allelic frequency of this variant was calculated to be 0.7% for this population The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98 The age related prevalence of CF among the South Asian and general populations was: 0-14 years, 1:9200 versus 1:6600; 15-24 years, 1:13,200 versus 1:7600; older than 25 years, 1:56,600 versus 1:12,400. A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. However, our data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants) CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals.

5e48a916d14c9f295d00000f	Which receptor is modulated with Siponimod?	RESULTS: Among a battery of molecules tested, siponimod, a dual agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5, was among the most efficient favoring remyelination. We validated several known promyelinating compounds and demonstrated that the strong remyelinating efficacy of siponimod implicates the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P1 ) modulators provide an emerging therapeutic approach for various autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Fingolimod is the first approved orally active, selective and potent drug of this class. Other drugs belonging to this class include siponimod, ponesimod, ceralifimod, amiselimod, CS-0777 and GSK2018682.  S1P receptor antagonists fingolimod and siponimod do not improve the outcome of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis mice after disease onset. Functional sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) antagonists like fingolimod and siponimod (BAF312) are successfully used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and fingolimod was shown to prevent the development of myasthenic symptoms in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), the standard model of MG. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of the functional S1PR1 antagonist, siponimod, in phase III clinical trials for autoimmune disorders and of the competitive sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1) antagonist, TASP0277308, in pre-clinical development in an in vivo model of TBI in mice.  In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. We assessed the effect of siponimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor1,5 modulator, on disability progression in patients with SPMS. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS.  A high incidence of hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was observed in mice treated for 2 years with siponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) functional antagonist, while no such tumors were observed in rats under the same treatment conditions.  Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. BACKGROUND  Siponimod is an oral selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor types 1 and type 5, with an elimination half-life leading to washout in 7 days. The next-generation sphingosine-1 receptor modulator BAF312 (siponimod) improves cortical network functionality in focal autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. Siponimod, a next-generation selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is currently being investigated for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Siponimod is a newer-generation sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that internalizes S1P1 receptors, thereby inhibiting efflux of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and thymus.

Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. Siponimod (BAF312) is a synthetic molecule belonging to the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulator family, which has putative neuroprotective properties and well-characterized immunomodulating effects mediated by sequestration of B and T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. INTERPRETATION: Siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression with a safety profile similar to that of other S1P modulators and is likely to be a useful treatment for SPMS. Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S1P modulators commercially available for the treatment of relapsing-remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S1P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S1P3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In this study, we directly compared the electropharmacological profiles of fingolimod with those of siponimod, a modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 and 5, using in vivo guinea-pig model and in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay to better understand the onset mechanisms of the clinically observed adverse events. BAF312 (Siponimod) is a dual agonist at the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors, S1PR1 and S1PR5. BAF312 (siponimod) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, with faster organ/tissue distribution and elimination kinetics than its precursor FTY720 (fingolimod). Siponimod, a selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors type 1 and type 5, demonstrated an excellent safety profile in a large study of patients with multiple sclerosis. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients.	['sphingosine-1-phosphate']

Upregulation of uc.189 in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinicopathologic value. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients.

5a86f074faa1ab7d2e00003a	With which cancers has the loss of SMARCB1 been associated?	We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets Genotyping cancer-associated genes in chordoma identifies mutations in oncogenes and areas of chromosomal loss involving CDKN2A, PTEN, and SMARCB1 When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis. SMARCB1/INI1 Involvement in Pediatric Chordoma All 8 cases were positive for brachyury, whereas there was no nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases, including the poorly differentiated chordoma  In this study, we considered immunohistochemistry and SMARCB1/INI1 mutational status to examine SMARCB1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas (7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated) pathogenic involvement of SMARCB1/INI1 in childhood chordoma The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC) Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs) Poorly differentiated chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in pediatric patients Identification of loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in poorly differentiated (PD) chordoma in pediatric patients suggests that PD chordoma is an entity molecularly distinct from conventional chordoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, which is also characterized by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by inactivating mutation of the SMARCB1/INI gene So far, around 20 cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression have been reported Here, we report two cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, which is very rare among the pediatric chordoma types Based on the clival location and histologic findings along with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and positivity for nuclear brachyury staining, the final pathologic diagnosis for both cases was PD chordoma Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs). The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC). loss of smarcb1 ini1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas ccs although mutation loss of 22q has strongly established the loss of smarcb1 ini1 in cancers the cause in ccs remains elusive recent studies suggest role of mirnas in regulation of smarcb1 ini1 expressions we examined 5 reported target predicted mirnas to smarcb1 ini1 in smarcb1 ini1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases and found upregulation of mir 671 5p and mir 193a 5p in smarcb1 ini1 immunonegative cases notably these two mirnas were significantly predicted to target tgf β signaling suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in ccs overall we suggest mir 671 5p and mir 193a 5p mediated epigenetic mode of smarcb1 ini1 loss and downregulated tgf β pathway in ccs. smarcb1 ini1 involvement in pediatric chordoma a mutational and immunohistochemical analysis chordomas arise in the skull base and spine and usually occur in adults and are rare in the pediatric population cases of chordoma in pediatric age are often poorly differentiated showing cytologic atypia increased cellularity and mitosis and their aggressive behavior is associated with a high incidence of metastatic spread and a short patient survival recent studies have described loss of smarcb1 ini1 protein in poorly differentiated chordomas associated not with point mutations but with smarcb1 ini1 gene deletions instead in this study we considered immunohistochemistry and smarcb1 ini1 mutational status to examine smarcb1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas 7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated we performed immunohistochemical tests for ini1 brachyury s100 and cytokeratins and conducted a genetic analysis on the smarcb1 coding sequence nm 003073 using the sanger method and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to detect abnormal copy numbers of the gene locus all 8 cases were positive for brachyury whereas there was no nuclear smarcb1 ini1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases including the poorly differentiated chordoma genetic analysis identified a missense mutation in 2 cases and a nonsense mutation associated with loss of smarcb1 ini1 protein and features of poorly differentiated tumor in 1 these mutations were novel variants occurring in heterozygosity and they were judged to be pathogenic by 3 different bioinformatic tools in 7 of 8 cases we performed multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification and 3 cases showed deletions at the smarcb1 locus our results confirm the pathogenic involvement of smarcb1 ini1 in childhood chordoma we also describe 3 novel pathogenic mutations.

56cdf3e55795f9a73e00003c	Which type of GTPases is required for amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1?	Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb mTORC1 promotes growth in response to the availability of nutrients, such as amino acids, which drive mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. How amino acid levels are communicated to mTORC1 is only recently coming to light by the discovery of a lysosome-based signaling system composed of Rags (Ras-related GTPases) and Ragulator v-ATPase, GATOR (GAP activity towards Rags), and folliculin (FLCN) complexes The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues. A key input is amino acids, which act through the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD) in order to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation The heterodimeric Rag GTPases localize mTORC1 to lysosomes by their amino-acid-dependent interaction with the lysosomal Ragulator complex. These new findings define the lysosome as a site of action for FLCN and indicate a critical role for FLCN in the amino acid-dependent activation of mTOR via its direct interaction with the RagA/B GTPases. We show that LRS directly binds to Rag GTPase, the mediator of amino acid signaling to mTORC1, in an amino acid-dependent manner and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPase to activate mTORC1. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases, which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP, the immediate activator The Rag GTPases interact with mTORC1 and signal amino acid sufficiency by promoting the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation Amino acids stimulate mTORC1 activation at the lysosome in a manner thought to be dependent on the Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), the Ragulator complex, and the vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase) Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome.  Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb.  These new findings define the lysosome as a site of action for FLCN and indicate a critical role for FLCN in the amino acid-dependent activation of mTOR via its direct interaction with the RagA/B GTPases. Interestingly, p62 colocalizes with Rags at the lysosomal compartment and is required for the interaction of mTOR with Rag GTPases in vivo and for translocation of the mTORC1 complex to the lysosome, a crucial step for mTOR activation. Our results indicate that FLCN is specifically required for the amino acid-stimulated recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes by Rag GTPases.  Mutation of LRS amino acid residues important for leucine binding renders the mTORC1 pathway insensitive to intracellular levels of amino acids. We show that LRS directly binds to Rag GTPase, the mediator of amino acid signaling to mTORC1, in an amino acid-dependent manner and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPase to activate mTORC1.

Exogenous coproporphyrin III production by Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Microbacterium oxydans in erythrasma lesions. Erythrasma is a superficial skin disease caused by Gram-positive Corynebacterium species. AIM: To study a series of demographic features of patients suffering from pitted keratolysis, and to present a review of the Corynebacterium-associated infections, including pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis. Corynebacterium minutissimum is the bacteria that leads to cutaneous eruptions of erythrasma and is the most common cause of interdigital foot infections.  Bacterial skin infections caused by corynebacteria include erythrasma, trichomycosis axillaris and pitted keratolysis. Corynebacterium minutissimum is the bacteria that leads to cutaneous eruptions of erythrasma and is the most common cause of interdigital foot infections. Corynebacteria causes erythrasma, trichomycosis or pitted keratolysis. BACKGROUND Erythrasma is a superficial skin infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum . skin infections are common and may be caused by bacteria fungi or viruses breaks in the skin integrity particularly those that inoculate pathogens into the dermis frequently cause or exacerbate skin infections bacterial skin infections caused by corynebacteria include erythrasma trichomycosis axillaris and pitted keratolysis staphylococci may cause impetigo ecthyma and folliculitis streptococcal skin infections include impetigo and erysipelas human papillomavirus skin infections present as several different types of warts depending on the surface infected and its relative moisture and the patterns of pressure the many dermatomycoses skin infections caused by fungi or yeasts include tinea capitis tinea barbae tinea cruris tinea manus tinea pedis and tinea unguium onychomycosis candidal infections occur in moist areas such as the vulva mouth penis skinfolds and diaper area wounds caused by wood splinters or thorns may result in sporotrichosis animal bites may result in complex serious infections requiring tetanus and possibly rabies prophylaxis in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy. erythrasma is a superficial skin disease caused by gram positive corynebacterium species coral red fluorescence under wood s light strongly suggestive of erythrasma can be attributed to the presence of porphyrins fractionated porphyrin analysis in erythrasma lesions is yet to be reported we attempted to investigate erythrasma lesions by isolating the responsible bacteria and determining their exogenous porphyrin production by hplc analysis we observed a 78 year old woman with erythrasma who had a well demarcated slightly scaling patch on her left foot between the fourth and fifth toes two kinds of colonies on 5 sheep blood agar were obtained from this lesion analysis of the 16s rrna sequence revealed the colonies to be corynebacterium aurimucosum and microbacterium oxydans hplc analysis demonstrated that coproporphyrin iii copro iii levels were clearly elevated although the amounts of protoporphyrin were diminished these results indicate that the fluorescent substance was copro iii this study supports the view that excess copro iii synthesis by c aurimucosum and m oxydans leads to accumulation of porphyrin in cutaneous tissue which emits a coral red fluorescence when exposed to wood s light. interdigital foot infections are mostly caused initially by dermatophytes yeasts and less frequently by bacteria erythrasma caused by corynebacterium minutissimum can be confused with superficial mycoses the aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the etiologic agents of superficial mycoses and the frequency of corynebacterium minutissimum in interdigital foot infections all the samples obtained from the 121 patients with interdigital foot infections were examined directly with the use of 20 potassium hydroxide mounts and gram stain under the microscope and cultured on sabouraud s dextrose agar plates in identification of superficial mycoses the rate was found to be 14 with the cultural method and 14 with direct microscopic examination using a combination of direct microscopic examination and culture a 33 8 ratio was achieved in the culture of these samples the most isolated factor was trichophyton rubrum 33 7 in 24 of the patients 19 8 corynebacterium minutissimum was detected by gram staining in 6 of these patients trichophyton rubrum was found trichophyton mentagrophytes was found in 2 and trichosporon spp was found in 1 the examination of interdigital foot lesions in the laboratory the coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and yeast should be considered. exogenous coproporphyrin iii production by corynebacterium aurimucosum and microbacterium oxydans in erythrasma lesions corynebacterium minutissimum is the bacteria that leads to cutaneous eruptions of erythrasma and is the most common cause of interdigital foot infections it is found mostly in occluded intertriginous areas such as the axillae inframammary areas interspaces of the toes intergluteal and crural folds and is more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus than other clinical patients this organism can be isolated from a cutaneous site along with a concurrent dermatophyte or candida albicans infection the differential diagnosis of erythrasma includes psoriasis dermatophytosis candidiasis and intertrigo and methods for differentiating include wood s light examination and bacterial and mycological cultures erythromycin 250mg four times daily for 14 days is the treatment of choice and other antibacterials include tetracycline and chloramphenicol however the use of chloramphenicol is limited by bone marrow suppression potentially leading to neutropenia agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia further studies are needed but clarithromycin may be an additional drug for use in the future where there is therapeutic failure or intertriginous involvement topical solutions such as clindamycin whitfield s ointment sodium fusidate ointment and antibacterial soaps may be required for both treatment and prophylaxis limited studies on the efficacy of these medications exist however systemic erythromycin demonstrates cure rates as high as 100 compared with tetracyclines systemic erythromycin has greater efficacy in patients with involvement of the axillae and groin and similar efficacy for interdigital infections whitfield s ointment has equal efficacy to systemic erythromycin in the axillae and groin but shows greater efficacy in the interdigital areas and is comparable with 2 sodium fusidate ointment for treatment of all areas adverse drug effects and potential drug interactions need to be considered no cost effectiveness data are available but there are limited data on cost related treatment issues a guideline is proposed for the detection evaluation treatment and prophylaxis of this cutaneous eruption. erythrasma is a superficial skin infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum interdigital erythrasma is the most common form and is easily confused with tinea pedis the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis this study was performed between january 1 2011 and january 31 2012 it included 182 patients who presented with concerns about interdigital lesions all of the patients were examined with a wood s lamp and smears were stained with gram s method direct examination with 20 potassium hydroxide was performed of 182 patients with interdigital lesions 73 40 1 were diagnosed as having erythrasma the mean sd age of the patients with erythrasma was 45 52 10 83 years range 22 70 years most of the patients with erythrasma were women 56 2 the most often clinical finding was desquamation using only wood s lamp examination or gram s staining resulted in 31 42 5 or 14 19 2 positive patients respectively using wood s lamp examination and gram s staining concurrently resulted in 28 positive patients 38 4 interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be difficult to differentiate from tinea pedis simple and rapid diagnosis can be made with wood s lamp examination but gram s staining is also a useful method especially in patients with negative wood s lamp examination findings. erythrasma is an uncommon vulvar infection best diagnosed by its fluorescence under the wood lamp this report shows that despite a negative wood lamp examination the diagnosis can be made histologically a 42 year old woman was referred to our clinic with a persistent candidal infection evaluation included a wood lamp examination wet mount and potassium hydroxide test of the affected skin all of which were negative a biopsy of the area demonstrated rods and filamentous organisms in the keratotic layer consistent with a corynebacterium minutissimum infection the patient was diagnosed as having erythrasma and she responded to oral erythromycin persistent vulvar diseases may be caused by erythrasma despite a negative wood lamp examination the diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the lesion. erythrasma is a skin infection which is caused by corynebacterium minutissimum interdigital erythrasma is the most common form the aim of this study was to detect the frequency and risk factors of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis this study was conducted between june and december 2010 and included 122 patients who had interdigital foot lesions all patients were examined using a wood s lamp the smears were stained using gram s method direct examination was performed using 20 potassium hydroxide sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar were used for cultures moreover the demographical characteristics of patients concomitant diseases and clinical findings were also recorded cases that were found to be positive on wood s lamp examination and or gram staining culture were considered as erythrasma the rate of erythrasma was found to be 46 7 the mean age was 43 6 years and the disease was more prevalent in men the most common clinical finding was desquamation mycological examination was found as positive in 40 35 of the patients no growth was observed in bacteriological cultures it was found that using only wood s lamp examination or gram staining resulted in 11 9 and 19 positive patients 15 6 respectively whereas using both wood s lamp examination and gram staining concurrently resulted in 27 positive patients 22 1 interdigital erythrasma is a commonly seen condition and can clinically mimic tinea pedis a wood s lamp is a good diagnostic tool but gram staining particularly in those with a negative wood s lamp result may be a useful method. erythrasma is a superficial infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum and affects the major skin folds and the interdigital regions of the feet it is characterized by erythematous brown scaly patches and maceration and exhibits coral red fluorescence under wood light the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of erythrasma in patients with interdigital lesions an open prospective longitudinal observational study was performed in a hospital in mexico city between march and december 2006 all patients with interdigital lesions were examined with a wood lamp and direct examination was performed with 20 potassium hydroxide cultures were done in sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar and smears were analyzed general characteristics and concomitant diseases were recorded we examined 73 patients of whom 24 32 8 were diagnosed with erythrasma based on coral red fluorescence under wood light and identification of corynebacteria by gram staining the disease was more common in women 83 33 and the mean age of the patients was 43 5 years the main clinical findings were scaling and maceration and the fourth interdigital web was the most commonly affected corynebacterium could not be isolated in any of the cases mycology was positive in 15 cases 62 5 and the following microorganisms were isolated candida 16 6 dermatophytes 12 5 and trichosporon 4 1 interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be easily confused with interdigital tinea it persists if not treated appropriately rapid diagnosis is easily obtained by examination with a wood lamp while culture is difficult and unnecessary for diagnosis the coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and candida should be considered when the interdigital webs are affected. erythrasma is a superficial cutaneous infection caused by corynebacterium minutissimum and is characterized by fluorescence under wood s light uv because of the presence of porphyrins these molecules are photosensitizing and we propose to assess efficacy of red light that activates porphyrins photodynamic reaction in treatment of this pathology assessment of effects of photodynamic action of red light for treatment of erythrasma without exogenous photosensitizing molecules thirteen patients with erythrasma were treated by one illumination 80 j cm2 by red light broad band peak at 635 nm without exogenous photosensitizing molecules disappearance or reduction of extent of lesions were observed 2 weeks later if lesions were still present a second irradiation was conducted with the same method preliminary results are presented as a result of red light irradiation we noticed a complete recovery for three patients and in most other cases reduction of extent of lesions mean 29 after one session the treatment was well tolerated we report first cases of photodynamic treatment of erythrasma there are other reports of clinical applications of antimicrobial action of photodynamic therapy in dermatology acne vulgaris leishmaniasis warts etc but there are few applications without addition of exogenous photosensitizing agent the originality and interest of our study is to use spontaneous presence of porphyrins in the lesions this technique seems to be an interesting alternative inexpensive and easy for the treatment of this localized infection but an optimal method is still to be determined to improve efficacy. bacterial skin infections are important to recognize because we have the means to eradicate almost all of them primary skin infections are mainly caused by staphylococci or streptococci staphylococci infections present as furuncles and carbuncles superficial folliculitis impetigo or rarely the scalded skin syndrome streptococcal infections present as impetigo ecthyma erysipelas or cellulitis corynebacteria causes erythrasma trichomycosis or pitted keratolysis gram negative primary skin infections although uncommon may occur bacterial cultures are generally necessary for diagnosis secondary bacterial infections of pre existing wounds burns dermatitic skin or retention cysts are common events. infective embolic retinopathy as a sequela of bacterial endocarditis is described in a 31 year old woman with mitral valve prolapse the infective organism corynebacterium minutissimum has not been previously found to cause ocular or multisystem diseases it is a common mucocutaneous inhabitant which causes erythrasma in our case report both ocular involvement and septicaemia were present the infection was confirmed by positive serial blood cultures mitral valve prolapse was confirmed by echocardiography on clinical examination the retinopathy consisted of white intraretinal lesions which resolved with antibiotic therapy by fluorescein angiography focal areas of hypofluorescence corresponding to the white fundus lesions were present optic disc oedema was also seen.

550af222c2af5d5b7000000b	Which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates IkB leading to its proteasomal degradation?	IKK activation and IκB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, β-TrCP, recognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples IκB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TrCP) -mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP results in accumulation of all the IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition.  Sequence comparison analysis showed sequence motif identity between CLU and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), a main E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IkappaB-alpha degradation. IkappaB degradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we show that beta-catenin stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein betaTrCP1, and identify the RNA-binding protein CRD-BP (coding region determinant-binding protein) as a previously unknown target of beta-catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRD-BP binds to the coding region of betaTrCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRD-BP stabilizes betaTrCP1 mRNA and elevates betaTrCP1 levels (both in cells and in vivo), resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)(betaTrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including IkappaB and beta-catenin.  The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation.

54ede8c594afd61504000009	In which phase of the cell cycle arrest is impaired in Fanconi anemia?	We found that ICLs activate a branched pathway downstream of the ATR kinase: one branch depending on CHK1 activity and the other on the FANCs-RMN complex. The transient slow-down of DNA synthesis was abolished in cells lacking ATR, whereas CHK1-siRNA-treated cells, NBS1 or FA cells showed partial S-phase arrest Arrest of S-phase progression is impaired in Fanconi anemia cells Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited cancer-susceptibility disorder, characterized by genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, and a prolonged G2 phase of the cell cycle We observed a marked dose-dependent accumulation of FA cells in the G2 compartment after treatment with 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (Me(3)Pso) in combination with 365 nm irradiation Taken together, the above data suggest that, in response to damage induced by DNA cross-linking agents, the S-phase checkpoint is inefficient in FA cells. This would lead to accumulation of secondary lesions, such as single- and double-strand breaks and gaps. The prolonged time in G2 phase seen in FA cells therefore exists in order to allow the cells to remove lesions which accumulated during the preceding abnormal S phase Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder defined by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC). MMC causes increased FA cell death, chromosome breakage, and accumulation in the G2 phase of the cell cycle DNA cross-linker-induced G2/M arrest in group C Fanconi anemia lymphoblasts reflects normal checkpoint function Cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia (FA) arrest excessively in the G2/M cell cycle compartment after exposure to low doses of DNA cross-linking agents Based on these studies we conclude that the aberrant G2/M arrest that typifies the response of FA(C) cells to low doses of cross-linking agents does not represent an abnormal cell cycle response but instead represents a normal cellular response to the excessive DNA damage that results in FA(C) cells following exposure to low doses of cross-linking agents Arrest of S-phase progression is impaired in Fanconi anemia cells. The 4N cell cycle delay in Fanconi anemia reflects growth arrest in late S phase.	['In Fanconi anemia cells, the S-phase checkpoint is inefficient.']

5ace19420340b9f05800000a	Which gene is responsible for red hair?	Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. Individuals with red hair have a predominance of phaeomelain in hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin, which may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from UVR. In mammals the relative proportions of phaeomelanin and eumelanin are regulated by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which acts via its receptor (MC1R), on melanocytes, to increase the synthesis of eumelanin and the product of the agouti locus which antagonises this action Our findings suggest that in humans, as in other mammals, the MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation phenotype and, more importantly, that variations in this protein are associated with a poor tanning response. In humans, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1 receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than skin type.  Red hair in man is due to certain loss of function mutations of one of the peptide products of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R, MIM 155555) This paper reviews the path of discovery of the MC1R in control of animal coat colour, the subsequent role of MC1R in human physiology and possibly wider role of MC1R in human skin carcinogenesis and human development through history. Melanocortin-1 receptor gene variants determine the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer independently of fair skin and red hair. A strong association between MC1R gene variants and fair skin and red hair was established, especially the variants Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp (P<.0001).  Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene variants are associated with fair skin and red hair Sequence polymorphism in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene as an indicator of the red hair phenotype. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype We report the frequencies of MC1R variants in the British red haired population. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R): more than just red hair.  Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour.  The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Altered cell surface expression of human MC1R variant receptor alleles associated with red hair and skin cancer risk. The human melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) encodes a G-protein coupled receptor that is primarily expressed on melanocytes, where it plays a key role in pigmentation regulation. Variant alleles are associated with red hair colour and fair skin, known as the RHC phenotype, as well as skin cancer risk. Red hair is the null phenotype of MC1R. The MC1R gene has many polymorphisms, some of which have been linked to variation in pigmentation phenotypes within human populations.  The association signals at the MC1R gene locus from CDH were uniformly more significant than traditional GWA analyses (the most significant P for CDH = 3.11×10⁻¹⁴² vs. P for rs258322 = 1.33×10⁻⁶⁶). The CDH test will contribute towards finding rare LOF variants in GWAS and sequencing studies. The MC1R gene plays a crucial role in pigmentation synthesis. Loss-of-function MC1R variants, which impair protein function, are associated with red hair color (RHC) phenotype and increased skin cancer risk. Genetic analysis of melanocortin 1 receptor red hair color variants in a Russian population of Eastern Siberia. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. In humans, loss-of-function MC1R mutations cause fair skin, freckling, red hair, and increased predisposition to melanoma; in mice, Mc1r loss-of-function is responsible for the recessive yellow mutation, associated with pheomelanic hair and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. The Melanocortin-1 Receptor (MC1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor, which is responsible for production of the darker eumelanin pigment and the tanning response. We show that a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which contains Mc1r will efficiently rescue loss of Mc1r in transgenic mice, and that overexpression of the receptor suppresses the effect of the endogenous antagonist, agouti protein. Pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene on human pigmentation. Variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene are common in individuals with red hair and fair skin, but the relative contribution to these pigmentary traits in heterozygotes, homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for variants at this locus from the multiple alleles present in Caucasian populations is unclear. A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. BACKGROUND Red hair color is caused by variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. Red hair individuals are usually compound heterozygotes or homozygous for one of a number of MC1R polymorphisms associated with red hair. Variants of the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) gene have been found to be associated with red hair and fair skin in humans. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype. The genetic basis for red hair involves specific mutations, red hair color (RHC) alleles, in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. In humans, loss-of-function MC1R mutations cause fair skin, freckling, red hair, and increased predisposition to melanoma; in mice, Mc1r loss-of-function is responsible for the recessive yellow mutation, associated with pheomelanic hair and a decreased number of epidermal melanocytes. A multiplex PCR and a multiplex single base extension protocol were established for genotyping six exonic MC1R variations highly penetrant for red hair (R), four exonic MC1R variations weakly penetrant for red hair (r), two frameshift variations highly penetrant for red hair (R) and three variations in the promoter region. We have investigated 174 individuals from 11 large kindreds with a preponderance of red hair and an additional 99 unrelated redheads, for MC1R variants and have confirmed that red hair is usually inherited as a recessive characteristic with the R151C, R160W, D294H, R142H, 86insA and 537insC alleles at this locus. Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) are two major genes affecting coat color phenotypes in mammals, and inactivation mutations in the MC1R gene are responsible for red coat color in European pig breeds. No loss-of-function mutation in MC1R responsible for red coat color in European breeds was observed in this breed. The genetic basis for red hair involves specific mutations, red hair color (RHC) alleles, in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. In conclusion, no functional variant responsible for brownish red coloration was found in the coding region of MC1R and ASIP in Tibetan pigs.. Red hair color is caused by variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene.	['Melanocortin 1 receptor', 'MC1R']
5e31cb85fbd6abf43b00004e	What gene is mutated in Huntington's Disease patients?	Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant neurodegenerative disease caused by a dominantly inherited CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the HD disease protein, huntingtin (HTT). PolyQ expansion promotes misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT (mHTT) within neurons. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Two decades ago, researchers identified that a CAG expansion mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene was involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, since the identification of the HTT gene, there has been no advance in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or reduce the progression of HD Mutations in the HTT gene , consisting of expansion of CAG triplets , cause the Huntington 's disease ( HD) , one of the major neurodegenerative disorders .  Huntington 's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that is caused by the mutation of the gene which produces a protein called huntingtin ( htt) .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system ( CNS ) that is defined by a CAG expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene leading to the production of mutant huntingtin ( mHtt) .  A mutation in the huntingtin ( Htt ) gene produces mutant Htt and Huntington 's disease ( HD) , a neurodegenerative disorder .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in patients with a mutation in the huntingtin or IT15 gene.  Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expanded stretch of consecutive trinucleotides (cytosine-adenosine-guanine, CAG) within the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4 (p16.3). Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by high instability and extension of CAG sequences within the coding region of IT15 gene. Huntington's disorder (HD), caused by mutations of the IT-15 gene, is an autosomal genetic disease that causes the breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. Positional cloning has shown that the Huntington disease (HD) mutation is an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene.	['HTT gene encoding the protein huntingtin']

5c72f5247c78d6947100007e	Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?	Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene. Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Exome sequencing revealed a novel biallelic deletion in the DCAF17 gene underlying Woodhouse Sakati syndrome. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements.  The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that was first described in 1983. Since its original description, approximately 50 cases have been reported with various clinical signs and symptoms.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. Despite identical genetic alteration, our 5 patients had various clinical features among them and compared with previously reported cases with the same pathogenic mutation.

5a804f71faa1ab7d2e00001d	Which algorithm is used for detection of long repeat expansions?	Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.

56d0451c3975bb303a00000e	Which signaling pathway does sonidegib inhibit?	The association between Hh activation status and tumor response to the Hh pathway inhibitor sonidegib (LDE225) was analyzed. Distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, including hedgehog (Hh) pathway-activated disease, have been reported.  We assessed the antitumour activity of sonidegib, a Hedgehog signalling inhibitor, in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma. Among such pathways, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch are of particular interest because agents that selectively inhibit these pathways are available and can be readily combined with agents such as vismodegib, sonidegib (LDE225), and BMS-833923, which target smoothened-a key Hh pathway regulator. This phase I trial was undertaken to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel smoothened inhibitor sonidegib (LDE225), a potent inhibitor of hedgehog signaling, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the hedgehog pathway inhibitor sonidegib (LDE225) were determined in healthy male subjects.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, in adults and children who had tumors with these fusions. CONCLUSIONS: Larotrectinib had marked and durable antitumor activity in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer, regardless of the age of the patient or of the tumor type. Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. INTERPRETATION: The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Larotrectinib Has Antitumor Activity in TRK Larotrectinib achieved a 93% response rate in pediatric patients with TRK fusion-positive tumors. To recapitulate resistance observed from type I NTRK kinase inhibitors entrectinib and larotrectinib, we generated NIH-3T3 cells exogenously expressing TPM3-NTRK1 wild-type, or acquired mutations G595R and G667C in vitro and in vivo.

5a6e472ab750ff4455000048	What is the function of the TMEM132 genes?	TMEM132: an ancient architecture of cohesin and immunoglobulin domains define a new family of neural adhesion molecules. Here we show the full domain architecture of human TMEM132 family proteins solved using in-depth sequence and structural analysis. We reveal them to be five previously unappreciated cell adhesion molecules whose domain architecture has an early holozoan origin prior to the emergence of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals. These findings strongly predict a cellular adhesion function for TMEM132 family, connecting the extracellular medium with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. The molecular functions of TMEM132 genes remain poorly understood and under-investigated despite their mutations associated with non-syndromic hearing loss, panic disorder and cancer.

53189b05b166e2b80600001e	Which glands are subject to attack by lymphocytes in Sjogren's syndrome?	In Sjögren's syndrome the autoimmune response is directed against the exocrine glands, which, as histopathological hallmark of the disease, display persistent and progressive focal mononuclear cell infiltrates. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by clonal B cell attack of the exocrine glands and dysregulated expression of B cell-activating factor (BAFF). Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by exocrine dysfunction resulting from chronic autoimmune attack primarily against the lacrimal and/or salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells chronically attack the lachrymal and salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease in which an immunological attack against the salivary and lacrimal glands results, respectively, in severe dry mouth and dry eye diseases. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands are the primary target and their functional impairment comes as a result of immune attack of epithelial cells of the affected organs (autoimmune epithelitis). Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of exocrine function as a result of a chronic immune attack directed primarily against the salivary and lacrimal glands leading to xerostomia (dry mouth) and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the lived experiences of women with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune syndrome in which invading lymphocytes attack moisture-producing glands of the body. This syndrome, affecting 4 million Americans, involves extreme dryness of the eyes and mouth and other systemic complications such as fatigue and muscle and joint pain. NOD mice manifest many features of autoimmune exocrinopathy (Sjögren's syndrome), a disease generally characterized by a chronic, progressive immunological attack against the exocrine tissues of the salivary and lacrimal glands.

51404dd723fec90375000002	What is the methyl donor of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases?	The product of the dcm gene is the only DNA cytosine-C5 methyltransferase of Escherichia coli K-12; it catalyses transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the C-5 position of the inner cytosine residue of the cognate sequence CCA/TGG.  Deoxycytosine methylase (Dcm) enzyme activity causes mutagenesis in vitro either directly by enzyme-induced deamination of cytosine to uracil in the absence of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), or indirectly through spontaneous deamination of [5-methyl]cytosine to thymine In the absence of DNA substrate, the DNA methyltransferase (MTase) M.BspRI can methylate itself using the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). The methyl group is transferred to two Cys residues of the MTase. The reaction is fairly insensitive to the methyl donor in the reaction, S-adenosylmethionine. Formation of the complex was dependent upon the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting that it comprises an enzyme-linked 5-substituted dihydrocytosine moiety in DNA.  The DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (m5C-MTase) M.BspRI is able to accept the methyl group from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) in the absence of DNA. Transfer of the methyl group to the enzyme is a slow reaction relative to DNA methylation. S Here, we report the structure of HhaI methyltransferase in complex with DNA containing a south-constrained abasic carbocyclic sugar at the target site in the presence of the methyl donor byproduct AdoHcy.

58bfd0db02b8c60953000017	Which virus type causes Molluscum contagiosum?	Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a poxvirus pathogenic for humans, replicates well in human skin in vivo, but not in vitro in standard monolayer cell cultures. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that causes tumor-like skin lesions.  Molluscum contagiosum poxvirus (MCV) type 1 and type 2 encode two chemokine-like proteins MC148R1 and MC148R2. I Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a common, human poxvirus that causes small papular skin lesions that persist for long periods without signs of inflammation.  All poxviruses studied encode a type 1B topoisomerase that introduces transient nicks into DNA and thereby relaxes DNA supercoils. Here we present a study of the protein domains of the topoisomerase of the poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (MCV), which allows us to specify DNA contacts made by different domains.  Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) causes molluscum contagiosum (MC) in both children and adults. MC54L, the IL-18 binding protein of the human poxvirus that causes molluscum contagiosum, is unique in having a C-terminal tail of nearly 100 amino acids that is dispensable for IL-18 binding. Molluscum contagiosum is a common superficial skin infection caused by the poxvirus, Molluscum Contagiosum virus. Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin and mucosal disease of viral origin, caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) virus of poxvirus family. Molluscum contagiosum is a benign contagious disease caused by a poxvirus.

5896271178275d0c4a000004	Which disease is treated with lucinactant?	Lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant containing sinapultide, a bioengineered peptide mimic of surfactant-associated protein B. A meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrates that lucinactant is as effective as animal-derived surfactants in preventing RDS in premature neonates, and in vitro studies suggest it is more resistant to oxidative and protein-induced inactivation. Its synthetic origin confers lower infection and inflammation risks as well other potential benefits, which may make lucinactant an advantageous alternative to its animal-derived counterparts, which are presently the standard treatment for RDS. We evaluated whether intratracheal lucinactant, a synthetic, peptide-containing surfactant, was safe and well-tolerated in infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and assessed its effects on clinical outcomes. An improvement in oxygenation and a significantly reduced requirement for retreatment suggests that lucinactant might improve lung function in infants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that early intervention with lucinactant may more effectively mitigate pulmonary pathophysiological sequelae of RDS than the animal-derived surfactants poractant alfa or beractant. Lucinactant for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates. The clinical trials that have been performed, although underpowered, may indicate that lucinactant is superior to phospholipid synthetic surfactant preparations and at least as effective as animal-derived surfactants in reducing morbidity and mortality from RDS.

58c27b7102b8c60953000021	Which effects create neighborhoods of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes?	Enhancer Sharing Promotes Neighborhoods of Transcriptional Regulation Across Eukaryotes Here, we present cross-organismic evidence suggesting that most EP pairs are compatible, largely determined by physical proximity rather than specific interactions. we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size.   We propose that enhancer sharing is commonplace among eukaryotes, and that EP distance is an important layer of information in gene regulation. This is especially true in mammalian systems, where regulation often occurs through long-range enhancers in gene-rich neighborhoods, rather than proximal promoters, preventing straightforward assignment of a binding site to a target gene.We present EMBER (Expectation Maximization of Binding and Expression pRofiles), a method that integrates high-throughput binding data (e.g. ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq) with gene expression data (e.g. DNA microarray) via an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for inferring the gene targets of sets of TF binding sites Enhancer Sharing Promotes Neighborhoods of Transcriptional Regulation Across Eukaryotes.

We aimed to assess further the effects of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS: We undertook a 6 month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of pridopidine in the treatment of motor deficits in patients with Huntington's disease. INTERPRETATION: This study did not provide evidence of efficacy as measured by the mMS, but a potential effect of pridopidine on the motor phenotype of Huntington's disease merits further investigation. Pridopidine up to 90 mg per day was well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease.  Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern. The putative restoration of function in cortico-subcortical circuitry by pridopidine is likely to make it useful for ameliorating several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Huntington's disease. Efficacy and safety of the dopaminergic stabilizer Pridopidine (ACR16) in patients with Huntington's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine (ACR16) in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial, patients with HD received pridopidine (50 mg/d, n = 28) or placebo (n = 30).  CONCLUSIONS: Pridopidine shows promise as a treatment for some of the symptoms of HD.  Investigational drugs discussed include ALN-HTT (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc/Medtronic Inc), EPI-743 (Edison Pharmaceuticals Inc), LNK-754 (Link Medicine Corp) and pridopidine (NeuroSearch A/S). These effects of pridopidine may serve to strengthen the cortico-striatal communication and to improve motor control in Huntington's disease for which pridopidine is currently in development.

5e52a4ec6d0a277941000044	Which R package has been developed for MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics?	Phosphonormalizer: an R package for normalization of MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics. Global centering-based normalization is a commonly used normalization approach in mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. It scales the peptide abundances to have the same median intensities, based on an assumption that the majority of abundances remain the same across the samples. However, especially in phosphoproteomics, this assumption can introduce bias, as the samples are enriched during sample preparation which can mask the underlying biological changes. To address this possible bias, phosphopeptides quantified in both enriched and non-enriched samples can be used to calculate factors that mitigate the bias.Results: We present an R package phosphonormalizer for normalizing enriched samples in label-free mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Availability and implementation: The phosphonormalizer package is freely available under GPL ( > =2) license from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/phosphonormalizer).

5a75f6e083b0d9ea66000009	Which data simulator is available for CLIP-SEQ experiments?	CSEQ-SIMULATOR: A DATA SIMULATOR FOR CLIP-SEQ EXPERIMENTS. CLIP-Seq protocols such as PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP or iCLIP allow a genome-wide analysis of protein-RNA interactions. For the processing of the resulting short read data, various tools are utilized. Some of these tools were specifically developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.

5c61d278e842deac67000005	Which disease can be classified with the Awaji Criteria?	Adoption of the Awaji criteria significantly increased the yield of EMG-positive segments in the cervical (P < 0.0005) and lumbosacral (P < 0.0001) regions, and upgraded 19 patients into the probable category and 1 patient into the definite category. The Awaji criteria increases the diagnostic sensitivity of the revised El Escorial criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis in a Chinese population. However, previous studies that have assessed the diagnostic sensitivities of the Awaji criteria (AC) and the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in patients with ALS have been inconsistent, most of them were consensual regarding the advantage of Awaji over conventional criteria. Our study sought to compare the roles of AC and rEEC in the diagnosis of ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that the AC exhibited greater diagnostic sensitivity than the rEEC in a Chinese ALS population.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the added prognostic value of the aggregated clinical and electrodiagnostic data, which define a given diagnostic category according to the Awaji or revised El Escorial criteria at time of diagnosis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Diagnostic category according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0177) criteria, definite ALS according to Awaji (p < 0.0001) or to revised El Escorial (p = 0.0343) and number of regions with LMN involvement (p < 0.0001) were all associated with shorter survival. Methods: This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study including a consecutive series of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to Awaji's criteria.  The importance of fasciculation potentials in the diagnosis of ALS led to changes in electrophysiological criteria at Awaji consensus conference.  Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies. STUDY SELECTION We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS. CONCLUSION The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS. In 2006, the Awaji criteria for the diagnosis of ALS were proposed, adding two major points to the diagnostic criteria: electromyography is considered equivalent to clinical examination for the identification of LMN signs and fasciculation potentials resume their prominent place in the diagnosis. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class IV evidence that the Awaji criteria have a higher sensitivity and the same specificity as the rEEC in identifying patients with ALS. OBJECTIVE To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Awaji and revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Awaji Commission recently proposed a modification of the electrodiagnostic criteria for ALS. INTRODUCTION Recently, some authors have claimed that the Awaji criteria (AC) are not always more sensitive than the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The updated Awaji criteria enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity in limb-onset ALS. BACKGROUND Recently, new electrophysiological ALS criteria incorporating fasciculation potentials (FPs) as evidence for lower motor neuron signs (Awaji Criteria (AC)) was proposed to provide earlier detection of early-stage ALS than revised El Escorial electrophysiological criteria (REEC). The Awaji criteria, recently introduced to increase diagnosis sensitivity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), equate the diagnostic significance of neurogenic electrophysiological changes to clinical signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months. New diagnostic criteria for ALS, the Awaji algorithm, reintroduced fasciculations as evidence of acute denervation equivalent to that of fibrillations and positive sharp waves. Given that cortical hyperexcitability appears to be an early feature in ALS, the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation technique as an aid to the research-based Awaji criteria in establishing an earlier diagnosis of ALS. The specificity of the both criteria were identical, 99.5%, indicating the number needed to test in order to diagnose one extra case of ALS was 1.8 (1.5-2) for Awaji criteria and 2.4 (2-2.6) for rEEC.  We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS.  Our retrospective analysis of patients referred over a 6-month period to the electromyography (EMG) laboratory for suspected motor neuron disease (MND) showed a higher agreement of the Awaji modifications than the Airlie House criteria with the clinical diagnosis of ALS. Participants had definite, probable, or possible ALS, as defined by the Awaji criteria; or pure motor disorder with clinical features of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in at least one body region, progressing over a 6 month follow-up period; or muscle wasting and weakness for at least 6 months.  Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.  <b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To estimate the potential diagnostic added value of the Awaji criteria for diagnosis of a myotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), which have been compared with the previously accepted gold standard the revised El Escorial criteria in several studies.<br><b>DATA SOURCES</b>: MEDLINE and Web of Science (until October2011).<br><b>STUDY SELECTION</b>: We searched for studies testing the diagnostic accuracy of the Awaji criteria vs the revised El Escorial criteria in patients referred with suspected ALS.<br><b>DATA EXTRACTION</b>: Evaluation and data extraction of identified studies were done independently. Application of Awaji criteria led to a 23% (95% CI, 12% to 33%; I2=84%) increase in the proportion of patients classified as having probable/definite ALS. Diagnostic accuracy of Awaji criteria was higher in bulbar- than in limb-onset cases.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: The Awaji criteria have a significant clinical impact allowing earlier diagnosis and clinical trial entry in ALS.<br> We assessed whether the Awaji recommendations improve the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of ALS. Using the El Escorial criteria, 51 patients were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS, 14 with probable laboratory-supported ALS, and 28 with possible ALS. Applying the Awaji recommendations, 66 patients were diagnosed with either definite or probable ALS, and 27 with possible ALS. Of the 14 patients diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS, eight switched to probable ALS and six to possible ALS using the Awaji recommendations; none of the patients with an ALS mimic was diagnosed with ALS according to the Awaji recommendations.

55180ef46487737b43000006	What is the typical rash associated with gluten ?	Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmunity-driven inflammatory blistering dermatosis associated with a gluten-dependent enteropathy.  Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune blistering disease that appears as a cutaneous manifestation of gluten intolerance.  Treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis is based on a life-long, strict gluten-free diet, which improves all clinical aspects of gluten sensitivity, and dapsone, a drug that is only effective for the skin manifestations. Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease are gluten-sensitive diseases that share immunopathological mechanisms. We report the unusual case of an 8-month-old child presenting to his general practitioner with pruritic skin lesions, subsequently proven to be dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) as the first sign of gluten-sensitive disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity.   These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised by IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaminase.  There is growing evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. BACKGROUND: A life-long gluten-free diet is the treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis, which is considered to be coeliac disease of the skin.  We report long-term clinical and histological remissions in seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the reintroduction of dietary gluten. Gluten sensitive enteropathy has various manifestations, of which the two major forms are classical coeliac disease (cCD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent.  Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a specific dermatological manifestation of coeliac disease and 80% of DH patients have gluten sensitive enteropathy manifested by crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy.  The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a lifelong, gluten-sensitive, blistering skin disease with pathognomonic immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposits in the papillary dermis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy.  Serum IgA class antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) are increased in untreated patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and it has been suggested that salivary IgA-AGA measurements could be used as a non-invasive screening test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy.  Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. The central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal biopsy. The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent. The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity. This contrasts to the situation in dermatitis herpetiformis, where both the rash and the enteropathy are gluten dependent.

Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Olaratumab, an Anti-PDGFRα Human Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients with Advanced and/or Metastatic Cancer. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Olaratumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα). Conclusions: Overall, these data indicate that olaratumab, alone and in combination with standard of care, blocks the growth of some preclinical PDGFRα-expressing pediatric bone and soft tissue tumor models.  Recent randomised phase II trial data have indicated that the addition of olaratumab, a novel monoclonal antibody against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), to doxorubicin confers an unprecedented improvement in overall survival to patients with anthracycline-naïve advanced soft tissue sarcoma. While preclinical data show that olaratumab specifically inhibits PDGFRα-mediated oncogenic signalling with attendant anti-tumour effects, a lack of correlation between pharmacodynamics markers of PDGFRα inhibition and clinical benefit from olaratumab suggest other mechanisms beyond modulation of downstream PDGFRα molecular pathways. Lartruvo® (olaratumab) is a fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα).  Olaratumab (Lartruvo™) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeted against the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor α (PDGFRα). Olaratumab acts by selectively binding PDGFRα, thereby blocking PDGF ligand binding and inhibiting PDGFRα activation and downstream signalling.

Olaratumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFR-α) preventing binding of its ligands and receptor activation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Olaratumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα). Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, plus doxorubicin significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) in a prior phase 1b/2 randomized trial. Olaratumab (LY3012207/IMC-3G3) is a human mAb that exclusively binds to PDGFRα and recently received accelerated FDA approval and conditional EMA approval for treatment of advanced adult sarcoma patients in combination with doxorubicin. The most important is the combination of the standard cytotoxic agent doxorubicin plus the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor olaratumab, although definitive results from a phase III trial are expected. DATA SYNTHESIS Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody. Lartruvo (olaratumab) is a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of PDGFRA.

5c61f767e842deac67000007	Which ploidy-agnostic method has been developed for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data?	Telomerecat: A ploidy-agnostic method for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data. To this end, a number of approaches for estimating telomere length from whole-genome sequencing data have been proposed. Here we present Telomerecat, a novel approach to the estimation of telomere length. Previous methods have been dependent on the number of telomeres present in a cell being known, which may be problematic when analysing aneuploid cancer data and non-human samples. Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons. We also apply the method to a cancer cell data, uncovering an interesting relationship with the underlying telomerase genotype. Telomerecat: A ploidy-agnostic method for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data.Telomere length is a risk factor in disease and the dynamics of telomere length are crucial to our understanding of cell replication and vitality.

5c9fb428ecadf2e73f000041	Salivary Cortisol is a biomarker for what disease/syndrome/condition?	Salivary cortisone, as a biomarker for psychosocial stress, is associated with state anxiety and heart rate. ortisol as a stress biomarker The salivary cortisol level reflects psychological stress, and it is a good index to assess chronic stress. SUMMARY Salivary cortisol and cortisone can be used to assess cortisol excess, deficiency and hydrocortisone replacement, with salivary cortisone having the advantage of detection when serum cortisol levels are low and there is no interference from oral hydrocortisone. Salivary cortisone is a superior marker of serum cortisol compared with salivary cortisol, specifically when serum cortisol is low and during hydrocortisone therapy when contamination of saliva may result in misleading salivary cortisol concentrations. Salivary cortisol is frequently used as a biomarker of psychological stress. The present paper addresses several psychological and biological variables, which may account for such dissociations, and aims to help researchers to rate the validity and psychobiological significance of salivary cortisol as an HPAA biomarker of stress in their experiments. However, psychobiological mechanisms, which trigger the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) can only indirectly be assessed by salivary cortisol measures. Salivary cortisol as a biomarker in stress research. As a biomarker for depression, salivary cortisol VAR demonstrated an optimal cutoff point at 77.8% (AUC=0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98), which is associated with a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 96.0%. Salivary cortisol is considered to be a safe and noninvasive measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, and is a commonly measured biomarker of the human stress response in pediatric research. BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), considered a non-invasive biomarker for sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and salivary cortisol as possible pain-induced stress biomarker, in horses with acute abdominal disease. Salivary cortisol is commonly used as a clinical biomarker of endocrine status and also as a marker of psychosocial stress. CONCLUSION Salivary cortisol concentration is positively correlated with occupational stress and increases with the increasing degree of occupational stress, and can be used as an objective biomarker for the identification and evaluation of occupational stress. PURPOSE Cortisol is frequently assayed as a stress-responsive biomarker which changes over the course of minutes to meet the demands of a person's social context. METHODS In 323 children (5-10 years old) participating in the Belgian ChiBS study, salivary cortisol samples, a biomarker for stress, was sampled when waking up, 30 and 60 min after wake up and in the evening on two consecutive weekdays. Cortisol is a classical biomarker for the stress levels of human beings. Finally, salivary cortisol has been used extensively as a biomarker of stress in a research setting, especially in studies examining psychological stress with repeated measurements.

58d8e6818acda3452900000a	Which gene mutations cause the Marfan syndrome?	The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome (MFS) highlight the importance of a FBN1 mutation test in diagnosing MFS.  A marked decrease in heart rate variability in Marfan syndrome patients with confirmed FBN1 mutations. The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation.  Heart rates in MS patients with the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test (p<0.001). A marked decrease in HRV, documented in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed FBN1 gene mutations. Evaluating the quality of Marfan genotype-phenotype correlations in existing FBN1 databases. Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Novel FBN1 gene mutation and maternal germinal mosaicism as the cause of neonatal form of Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1).  While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. [Screening of FBN1 gene mutations in a family with Marfan syndrome]. To identify FBN1 gene mutations in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome. Identification of fibrillin-1 gene mutations in Marfan syndrome by high-resolution melting analysis. Three diagnostic classifications comprising first, Marfan genotype with a causative FBN1 gene mutation; second, Marfan phenotype with clinical criteria of the original Ghent nosology (Ghent-1); and third, phenotype with clinical criteria of its current revision (Ghent-2) in 300 consecutive persons referred for confirmation or exclusion of Marfan syndrome (150 men, 150 women aged 35 ± 13 years) were used. Prevalence of dural ectasia in 63 gene-mutation-positive patients with features of Marfan syndrome type 1 and Loeys-Dietz syndrome and report of 22 novel FBN1 mutations. Marfan syndrome type 1 (MFS1) is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. Fibrillin gene (FBN1) mutations in Japanese patients with Marfan syndrome. Mutations in FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2 are known to cause Marfan syndrome (MIM 154700), a pleiotropic disorder. Classic, atypically severe and neonatal Marfan syndrome: twelve mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in FBN1 exons 24-40. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype. Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) are known to cause classical Marfan's syndrome, ectopia lentis and neonatal Marfan's syndrome. Severe Marfan syndrome due to FBN1 exon deletions. BACKGROUND: Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications. It is still difficult to use modern genetic testing for diagnosis because Marfan syndrome can be caused by many different mutations in FBN1, a large gene with 65 coding segments, while mutations in other genes can cause overlapping phenotypes The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations.Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), and related connective tissue disorders Acute mitral regurgitation due to chordal rupture in a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by a deletion in exon 29 of the FBN1 gene. Neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by an exon 25 mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. Functional pulmonary atresia in a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by a c.3602G>A mutation in exon 29 of the FBN1 gene. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system.  It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome. Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes. Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome. By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of Marfan syndrome by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the renal malformation in the patient. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD. Marfan syndrome is a multisystem disorder of connective tissue that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and results from mutation of the FBN1 gene on human chromosome 15. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system. We here report 22 novel and 9 recurrent mutations in the FBN1 gene in 36 patients with clinical features of Marfan syndrome. The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission. FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause Marfan syndrome in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the Marfan syndrome type II gene. Fifteen novel FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome detected by heteroduplex analysis of genomic amplicons. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. Mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin-1, FBN1, are known to cause Marfan syndrome, and have been identified in almost all exons of FBN1. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population. While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, on chromosome 15q21.1, have been found to cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by clinically variable skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterised by pleiotropic manifestations involving primarily the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene causing the Marfan syndrome.

5c5f0fb41a4c55d80b000013	What is a GPI anchor?	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of proteins is a conserved posttranslational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  In eukaryotes, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification of many glycoproteins on the cell surface is highly conserved. The lipid moieties of GPI-anchored proteins undergo remodelling processes during their maturation.  Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are lipid anchors allowing the exposure of proteins at the outer layer of the plasma membrane.  Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-APs) represent a class of soluble proteins attached to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane by a post-translation modification, the GPI anchor.

5e5e502a1af46fc13000000a	What receptor is associated with the protein encoded by the Spätzle gene?	 In Drosophila, apoptotic elimination of the weaker "loser" cells from growing wing discs is induced by a signaling module consisting of the Toll ligand Spätzle (Spz), several Toll-related receptors, and NF-κB factors The Drosophila Toll-1 receptor is involved in embryonic development, innate immunity, and tissue homeostasis. Currently, as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor, only Spätzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The ligand for the Toll receptor is thought to be spätzle (spz), a secreted protein that is activated by proteolytic cleavage. Spätzle protein is an extracellular ligand of Toll receptor in Toll signaling pathway involved in the embryonic dorsoventral patterning and in the innate immunity. spätzle acts immediately upstream of the membrane protein Toll in the genetic pathway, suggesting that spätzle could encode the ventrally localized ligand that activates the receptor activity of Toll. The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor. The canonical Toll receptor (Toll-1) is activated by the cytokine Spätzle (Spz-1), but Drosophila encodes eight other Toll genes and five other Spz genes whose interactions with one another and associated functions are less well-understood.

5506ce078e1671127b00000b	Which protein phosphatase has been found to interact with the heat shock protein, HSP20?	 Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20. Indeed, human genetic variants of inhibitor-1 (G147D) or Hsp20 (P20L) result in reduced binding and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1, suggesting aberrant enzymatic regulation in human carriers.  Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling.  Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease. Moreover, protein phosphatase-1 activity is regulated by two binding partners, inhibitor-1 and the small heat shock protein 20, Hsp20.

52b2e1d8f828ad283c00000c	What is the indication of Daonil (Glibenclamide)?	Metformin and glibenclamide are now increasingly viewed as a rational alternative to insulin therapy--a treatment both preferred by the women and a less expensive one, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The effect of TFG on blood glucose were studied and the levels of lipid peroxidation [MDA (Malondialdehyde)] and antioxidant enzymes [SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GPx (Reduced Glutathione peroxidase)] were estimated and compared with standard drugs glibenclamide and insulin. Treatment with TFG, insulin and glibenclamide resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose in LM (8.71%) and HM (3.87%) in comparison with normal controls. Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect. However, dietary supplementation with PB (6 g/kg extract for 4 weeks administered orally using an intragastric tube) ameliorated the alloxan-induced diabetes in a manner comparable with that of the reference antidiabetic drug glibenclamide Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). In mild NIDDM, gliclazide, tolbutamide or acetohexamide is used, and in more severe NIDDM glibenclamide is used. An improvement of the glucose tolerance could be observed up to 3 years, whereas after a 5-year glibenclamide therapy no certain influence on the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion could be proved. In general the improvement of the glucose tolerance was not associated with an increased secretion of insulin, so that an extrapancreatic effect of glibenclamide (improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity?) seems to be possible. From clinical and practical point of view the findings would support the opinion that normal weight persons with IGT, particularly in already decreased insulin secretion, have an indication for a glibenclamide therapy.

Ataxin-2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein first identified in humans as responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). The molecular basis of SCA2 is the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in Ataxin-2, encoding a Lsm domain that may bind RNA and a PAM2 motif that enables interaction with the poly (A) binding protein. In SCA2 brains, we found cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, microaggregates. Mice expressing ataxin-2 with Q58 showed progressive functional deficits accompanied by loss of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor and finally loss of Purkinje cells. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2).  Our analysis provides valuable information on the evolution and domain structure of Ataxin-2 proteins. Proline-rich motifs that may mediate protein interactions are widespread in Ataxin-2 proteins, but expansion of polyglutamine tracts associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is present only in primates, as well as some insects. The expansion of a polyQ repeat within the ataxin-2 protein causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). However, neither the precise pathological mechanism nor the physiological functions of ataxin-2 are known.	['Ataxin 2']

54f9c40ddd3fc62544000001	Which calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase is involved in the activation of the family of NFAT transcription factors (Nuclear Factors of Activated T cells)?	Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin signaling has been implicated in a broad spectrum of developmental processes in a variety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was first defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor nuclear translocation and activation. NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and regulate the transcription of cytokine genes critical for the immune response. The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization.  Calcium activated gene transcription through Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, (NFAT) proteins, is emerging as a ubiquitous mechanism for the control of important physiological processes. Of the five mammalian NFAT isoforms, transcriptional activities of NFATs 1-4 are stimulated by a calcium driven association between the ubiquitous phosphatase calcineurin and the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. Transcription factors of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family are expressed in most immune system cells and in a range of other cell types. Signaling through NFAT is implicated in the regulation of transcription for the immune response and other processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. NFAT normally resides in the cytoplasm, and a key aspect of the NFAT activation pathway is the regulation of its nuclear import by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin.  The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) group of transcription factors is retained in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells. NFAT activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import. This process requires calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT caused by the phosphatase calcineurin. The calcium-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B) functions as a regulator of gene expression in diverse tissues through the dephosphorylation and activation of a family of transcription factors known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Calcineurin, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase, plays a key role in T-cell activation by regulating the activity of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), a family of transcription factors required for the synthesis of several cytokine genes. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which signals to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors, serves as a transducer of calcium signals and is sufficient and necessary for pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Upon activation, Cn directly binds to, and dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors within the cytoplasm allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and participate in the regulation of gene expression. The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin	['Calcineurin', 'CaN', 'phosphatase 2b']

56c5fd325795f9a73e000005	Which is the genetic basis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?	Mutations in TRPV4, encoding a cation channel, have recently been identified in one large dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy kindred, but the genetic basis of dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy in many families remains unknown. We report clinical, electrophysiology, muscle magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology findings in a four generation family with typical dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy features, without mutations in TRPV4, and in whom linkage to other known dominant neuropathy and spinal muscular atrophy genes has been excluded. The autopsy findings in the proband, who died at 14 months of age from an unrelated illness, provided a rare opportunity to study the neuropathological basis of dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy. There was a redu Recently, the common forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have been associated with mutations of the SMN and NAIP genes on chromosome 5, in the region q11.2-13.3. Some correlation has been established between SMN protein levels and disease course; nevertheless, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic variability remains unclear, and it has been postulated that the loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of type I SMA Using comparative genomics to screen for such a factor among evolutionarily conserved sequences between mouse and human, we have identified a novel transcript, H4F5, which lies closer to SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region. A multi-copy microsatellite marker that is deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes is embedded in an intron of this gene, indicating that H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA. A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy A critical question is why only the homozygous loss of SMN1, and not SMN2, results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Thus, the failure of SMN2 to fully compensate for SMN1 and protect from SMA is due to a nucleotide exchange (C/T) that attenuates activity of an exonic enhancer. Autosomal recessive childhood proximal SMA is the commonest form and is due to mutations in a gene encoding a novel protein, SMN, that appears to play a critical role in RNA metabolism but has also been shown to interact with actin-binding proteins and mediators of programmed cell death. Mutations of the SMN1 gene are responsible for SMA. All patients were found to be homozygous for the loss of either exon 7 or exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene Six additional patients had anterior horn cell disease but were negative for the SMN1 gene deletion. All six had exclusion features listed in the international guidelines. The molecular genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, is the loss of function of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1) The structures of the SMN1 gene and SMN2 pseudogene, mutations distorting the SMN1 function, the structure and functions of the Smn neurotrophic protein, its role in biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and the principles and prdblems of molecular diagnosis in SMA are described. SMA are caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN1) leading to a reduction of the SMN protein amount. From a better knowledge of the genetic basis of SMA and the defects resulting from the mutations of SMN1 in cellular or animal models, several therapeutics strategies have been selected aiming at targeting SMN2, a partially functional copy of SMN1 gene which remains present in patients, or to prevent neurons from death. We used a homozygosity mapping and positional cloning approach in a consanguineous family of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and identified a nonsense mutation in the vaccinia-related kinase 1 gene (VRK1) as a cause of SMA-PCH SMN1 and SMN2 quantification was undertaken to investigate the genotype-phenotype relationship.RESULTS: Two novel point mutations were identified in exon 3 of SMN1 (p.Tyr130Cys and p.Tyr130His) in the highly conserved Tudor domain of the Smn protein.CONCLUSIONS: The genetic basis of SMA in the rare cases of compound heterozygous carriers of SMN1 deletions is complex.

52fb7c512059c6d71c000069	How much should be the duration of the QT interval in patients with short QT syndrome?	The short QT syndrome constitutes a new clinical entity that is associated with a high incidence of sudden cardiac death, syncope, and/or atrial fibrillation even in young patients and newborns. Patients with this congenital electrical abnormality are characterized by rate-corrected QT intervals<320 ms.  QT interval is shortened when QTc is less than 350 ms (1st degree of shortening). In children with QTc below 330 ms (2nd degree of shortening) short QT syndrome should be excluded. The short-QT syndrome is a new clinical entity characterized by corrected QT intervals <300 ms and a high incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF).  Short QT syndrome is a newly described cardiologic entity which associates a short OT interval (QT and QTc < or = 300 ms) on the surface ECG to a high risk of syncope or sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

What determines the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT: can these specific air distributions be valuable predictors of gastroduodenal perforation? PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine what gives rise to the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract perforation, and whether these specific air distributions can play a clinically meaningful role in the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation. The readers assessed the presence of specific air distributions on CT (periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs). RESULTS: All specific air distributions were more frequently present in patients with gastroduodenal perforation than lower GI tract perforation, but only the falciform ligament sign was statistically significant (p<0.05). Regardless of the perforation sites, the falciform ligament sign was present significantly more frequently with an increase in the amount of free air on multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; p<0.001).  To evaluate the usefulness of the PPFA sign, we compared the PPFA sign with the falciform ligament sign and the ligamentum teres sign, both of which are well-known CT signs of pneumoperitoneum.  The falciform ligament sign was seen in 24 of 30 (80%) patients with upper GI tract perforation and in 10 of 23 (43%) patients with lower GI tract perforation (p=.020).  Supine films from 44 cases of pneumoperitoneum were randomly interspersed among supine films from 87 control subjects without free air, and the films were reviewed for the presence or absence of various signs of pneumoperitoneum, including Rigler's sign (gas on both sides of the bowel wall), the falciform ligament sign (gas outlining the falciform ligament), the football sign (gas outlining the peritoneal cavity), the inverted-V sign (gas outlining the medial umbilical folds), and the right-upper-quadrant gas sign (localized gas in the right upper quadrant).  Forty-two patients with 10 cases of proximal GI perforation and 32 cases of distal GI perforation were evaluated based on the CT findings of extraluminal air (which was subdivided into the CT-falciform ligament sign crossing the midline and scattered pockets of air), bowel wall thickening (>8 mm in gastroduodenal wall,>3 mm in the small bowel wall,>6 mm in the caliber of the appendix and>5 mm in the colonic wall), associated abscess formation, ascites and adjacent fat stranding. Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P<.05).  Our results showed that CT-falciform ligament sign was more frequent in the proximal GI perforation, while pockets of extraluminal air (excluding the cases accompanying CT-falciform ligament sign), bowel wall thickening and fat stranding were found in higher incidence in distal GI perforation (P<.05).

5e4fd44a6d0a277941000033	What cellular process is the protein clathrin involved in?	ligand-receptor complexes are internalized via clathrin coated pits by a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis.  Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes). while clathrin mediated endocytosis w Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a cellular trafficking process in which cargoes and lipids are internalized from the plasma membrane into vesicles coated with clathrin and adaptor proteins. Clathrin is involved in the endocytosis and exocytosis of cellular proteins and the process of virus infection.

601d2d001cb411341a00002c	Which syndrome is caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein?	Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability. Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome Our report of variant in ARMC9 Leading to Joubert syndrome phenotype (JS30), elucidates the genetic heterogeneity of Joubert syndrome, and expands the gene list for ciliopathies.

531dd4af267d7dd05300000d	Inhibition of which enzyme is mechanism of action of alisertib?	Inhibition of AURKA using an investigational small-molecule specific inhibitor, alisertib, decreased the HDM2 protein level and induced P53 transcriptional activity.  Preclinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/efficacy relationships for alisertib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase. Alisertib (MLN8237) is an investigational inhibitor of Aurora A kinase (AAK). The spindle organization defects induced by alisertib have been used to develop a pharmacodynamic (PD) assay for Aurora A inhibition based on the percentage of mitotic cells with proper chromosomal alignment at the metaphase plate (% aligned spindles, abbreviated as AS).  Phase II study of alisertib, a selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, in relapsed and refractory aggressive B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We therefore designed a phase II study of alisertib, a selective AAK inhibitor, in patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In addition, we employed vMCF-7DRaf-1 cells that display high levels of endogenous cyclin-A and demonstrated that molecular targeting of Aurora-A by Alisertib reduces cyclin-A expression. Alisertib (MLN8237) an investigational agent suppresses Aurora A and B activity, inhibits proliferation, promotes endo-reduplication and induces apoptosis in T-NHL cell lines supporting its importance in PTCL treatment. Alisertib (MLN8237) an investigational agent that inhibits Aurora A Ser/Thr kinase has shown activity in PTCL patients. We further find that MLN8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo.  Phase II study of MLN8237 (alisertib), an investigational Aurora A kinase inhibitor, in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. This single-arm phase II study assessed single-agent efficacy and safety of the investigational AAK inhibitor MLN8237 (alisertib), in patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.  This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the investigational oral drug MLN8237 (alisertib), a small-molecule Aurora A kinase (AAK) inhibitor, in 87 adult patients with advanced solid tumors. This phase I study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MLN8237 (alisertib), an investigational, oral, selective AAK inhibitor, in 59 adults with advanced solid tumors.  Targeting Aurora A kinase activity with the investigational agent alisertib increases the efficacy of cytarabine through a FOXO-dependent mechanism. The investigational drug alisertib (MLN8237) is a novel Aurora A kinase inhibitor being studied in multiple Phase I and II studies.  Our collective data indicate that targeting Aurora A with alisertib represents a novel approach to increase the efficacy of ara-C that warrants further investigation. Characterization of Alisertib (MLN8237), an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of aurora A kinase using novel in vivo pharmacodynamic assays. Here, we describe preclinical characterization of alisertib (MLN8237), a selective AAK inhibitor, incorporating these novel pharmacodynamic assays. We investigated the selectivity of alisertib for AAK and ABK and studied the antitumor and antiproliferative activity of alisertib in vitro and in vivo. Alisertib inhibited AAK over ABK with a selectivity of more than 200-fold in cells and produced a dose-dependent decrease in bipolar and aligned chromosomes in the HCT-116 xenograft model, a phenotype consistent with AAK inhibition. Alisertib is a selective and potent inhibitor of AAK. 	['aurora kinase']
56c1f00def6e39474100003f	Which enzyme is inhibited by Varespladib?	The VISTA-16 trial of varespladib, a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome was terminated prematurely owing to futility and a signal towards harm. Large-scale Phase III trials are now underway with agents that lead to marked reductions in IL-6 and C-reactive protein (such as canakinumab and methotrexate) as well as with agents that impact on diverse non-IL-6-dependent pathways (such as varespladib and darapladib).  The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes. The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS. The potential pro-atherogenic role of PLA(2) led to the development of two small molecules, varespladib, a reversible sPLA(2) inhibitor, and darapladib, a selective Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor.  In the present article, the enzymatic properties and the involvement of sPLA(2) and Lp-PLA(2) in atherogenesis are reviewed, with a focus on the results of experimental studies and clinical studies with both varespladib and darapladib inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: Several secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), including group IIA, III, V, and X, have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which led to the clinical testing of A-002 (varespladib), a broad sPLA2 inhibitor for the treatment of coronary artery disease.  Varespladib was able to inhibit sPLA2 in the types of neonatal lung injury investigated. sPLA2 activity was reduced in hyaline membrane disease (P &lt; .0001), infections (P = .003), and meconium aspiration (P = .04) using 40 µM varespladib; 10 µM was able to lower enzyme activity (P = .001), with an IC(50) of 87 µM Varespladib methyl is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized to varespladib, and both compounds are able to potently inhibit the enzymes of the human secretory phospholipase groups IIa, V and X, which play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic disease and inflammation The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial at 362 academic and community hospitals in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, and North America of 5145 patients randomized within 96 hours of presentation of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to either varespladib (n = 2572) or placebo (n = 2573) with enrollment between June 1, 2010, and March 7, 2012 (study termination on March 9, 2012).INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive varespladib (500 mg) or placebo daily for 16 weeks, in addition to atorvastatin and other established therapies.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization at 16 weeks.  The composite secondary end point of cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke was observed in 107 patients (4.6%) in the varespladib group and 79 patients (3.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.82; P = .04).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with recent ACS, varespladib did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and significantly increased the risk of MI. The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130246. The central hypothesis of this study was that treatment with varespladib, a small-molecule inhibitor of sPLA(2) would reduce postprocedural release of cardiac biomarkers after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2007 and June 2009, 144 stable patients were randomized in a phase II trial to receive varespladib 500 mg PO BID or placebo 3 to 5 days before and for 5 days after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.  We evaluated whether endothelial function is attenuated after PCI and if inhibition of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity augments endothelial function and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in these patients.METHODS: In the sPLA2 Inhibition to Decrease Enzyme Release After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (SPIDER-PCI) study, patients undergoing elective PCI were randomized to receive Varespladib (Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Mateo, CA), an inhibitor of sPLA2, or placebo 3-5 days prior to PCI and for 5 days after PCI.  The present study evaluated the effects of sPLA2-IIA inhibition with varespladib acid in a novel mouse model, human apolipoprotein B (apoB)/human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)/human sPLA2-IIA triple transgenic mice (TTT) fed a Western-type diet.APPROACH AND RESULTS: sPLA2-IIA expression increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in TTT compared with human apoB/human CETP double transgenic mice (P<0.01). Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity. Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity.  Acute inhibition of sPLA2 activity with Varespladib does not affect endothelial or microvascular function after PCI. Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity. Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity. We aimed at investigating the effect of co-administration of surfactant and varespladib on sPLA2 activity. Alveolar macrophages were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then treated with either varespladib, surfactant, varespladib followed by surfactant or nothing.

A strong association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN has been reported in Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian and Indian populations, but not in Caucasian or Japanese populations. found a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the Han Chinese population from central and northern China. Combined with previous studies of the southern Han Chinese subpopulation, our results suggest that HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the whole Han Chinese population. A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has been identified in Chinese and Thai. In the present study, we conducted a pilot study to detect a possible association of oxcarbazepine (OXC)-induced MPE with HLA-B*1502 allele in Chinese Han population. observed an increased frequency of HLA-B*1502 allele in patients (44.44%) compared with tolerant controls (11.11%), although it failed to reach statistical significance (P=0.294). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HLA-B*1502 allele may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to OXC-induced MPE in Chinese Han population. A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN has been reported in Han Chinese but not in Caucasian and Japanese populations. A case-control study was conducted to determine whether HLA-B*1502 is a valid pharmacogenetic test for SJS/TEN caused by CBZ in a Thai population. Results from this study suggest that HLA-B*1502 may be a useful pharmacogenetic test for screening Thai individuals who may be at risk for CBZ-induced SJS and TEN. A strong association has been reported between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Han Chinese patients. European studies suggested that HLA-B*1502 is not a universal marker but is ethnicity-specific for Asians. the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502 is associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) induced by CBZ in Han Chinese. the HLA allele B*1502 as a marker for carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Han Chinese, This allele is seen in high frequency in many Asian populations other than Han Chinese, but there are few data on whether the allele is a marker for this severe outcome in anyone other than Han Chinese. a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in Han Chinese, but not in Caucasian populations. A very strong association of carbamazepine-induced SJS with HLA-B*1502 has recently been described in the Han Chinese population. there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures	['Han Chinese and other Asian populations, except Japanese']
516be1d6298dcd4e5100006a	What is the mode of inheritance of nemaline myopathy?	The results indicate that mutations in TPM2 may cause nemaline myopathy as well as cap disease with a dominant mode of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance had been verified or appeared likely in all nebulin cases Most cases were sporadic, but in addition there were instances of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance, while two families showed mosaicism for dominant mutations. Finding the causative mutation(s) determines the mode of inheritance We conclude that in the Finnish CNM patients, the mode of inheritance appears to be recessive.

5717dbfe7de986d80d000001	What is the functional role of the protein Drp1?	dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fission, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a protein required for mitochondrial network division. dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission Mitochondrial fission is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), Drp1 is a dynamin-like GTPase that mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal division in a process dependent on self-assembly and coupled to GTP hydrolysis.  Mitochondrial fission requires the dynamin GTPase Drp1, which assembles in a ring around the mitochondrion and appears to constrict both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. DRP1; a mitochondrial fission protein Mitochondrial morphology is primarily controlled by the activation of dynamin-related proteins including dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promotes mitochondrial fission.  The change in mitochondrial morphology was caused by downregulation of the expression of Fis1 and Drp1, two proteins regulating mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi. These results collectively indicate that ER-specific BNIP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in a BH3 domain-dependent fashion. In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes. Mitochondrial remodeling was associated with increased proximity between Rab11a and mitochondrial membranes, changes in fusion-fission dynamics, and mitochondrial relocalization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was regulated by the Rab11a effector protein FIP1/RCP. Functional analysis demonstrated that BNIP1 expression increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression followed by the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission. Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission in oxygen sensing and constriction of the ductus arteriosus. In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined In this study, we investigate the role of mitochondrial fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in myogenic differentiation Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission in oxygen sensing and constriction of the ductus arteriosus Functional analysis demonstrated that BNIP1 expression increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression followed by the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission These results collectively indicate that ER-specific BNIP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in a BH3 domain-dependent fashion Glucocorticoid modulation of mitochondrial function in hepatoma cells requires the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. Mitochondria in DRG neurons undergo hyperglycemic mediated injury through Bim, Bax and the fission protein Drp1. This novel function for DRP1 is distinct from its recognized role in regulating mitochondrial fission.  Abnormal interaction between the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease neurons: implications for mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage. SUMOylation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 occurs at multiple nonconsensus sites within the B domain and is linked to its activity cycle. Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial fission through modification of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. We highlight posttranslational modifications of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, for which these regulatory mechanisms are best characterized. Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi. Functionally, PINK1 knockdown and overexpression had opposite effects on dendritic spine formation and neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity. In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined.	['mitochondrial fission']

571f5e740fd6f91b6800000b	Which enzyme is deficient in Gaucher's disease?	Gaucher's disease is caused by deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity Gaucher's disease is due to glucocerebrosidase deficiency which is responsible for the accumulation of non degraded glucosylceramide within the lysosomes of macrophages: these "Gaucher cells", overloaded and alternatively activated, release in patient's plasma numerous compounds (cytokines, chemokines, hydrolases...) some of which contribute to the various tissue damages Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase Gaucher disease is an inborn recessive autosomal disease due to a partial deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. The deficient activity leads to accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside in the liver, the spleen and bone marrow with concomitant anemia and thrombocytopenia Alglucerase is a modified form of human placental glucocerebrosidase used as enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher's disease, in whom functional glucocerebrosidase is deficient The common mutations found in the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, beta-glucocerebrosidase, earmark these proteins for destruction by the endoplasmic reticulum-localised protein folding machinery, resulting in enzyme insufficiency, lysosomal glycolipid storage and subsequent pathology. Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls. It is an essential activator for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD). The gene for glucocerebrosidase ( GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, is located in a gene-rich region on 1q21. β-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, also has an essential role in maintaining epidermal permeability function, by regulating the ratio of ceramides to glucosylceramides in the stratum corneum of the skin. Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are also identified at an increased frequency among Parkinson probands, including those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Structure/function relationships of acid beta-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, were evaluated by characterizing the proteins expressed from cDNAs encoding normal and mutant enzymes. Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA, E.C.3.2.1.45) GBA encodes for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease (GD) LIMP-2 is required for the normal biogenesis and maintenance of lysosomes and endosomes and has been identified as the specific receptor for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are a common genetic risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease and related disorders, implicating the role of this lysosomal hydrolase in the disease etiology This gene is involved in lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate-independent trafficking of β-glucocerebrosidase (GC), an enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, caused by deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase Mutations in GBA, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are common risk factors for Parkinson disease, as patients with Parkinson disease are over five times more likely to carry GBA mutations than healthy controls The common mutations found in the lysosomal enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, beta-glucocerebrosidase, earmark these proteins for destruction by the endoplasmic reticulum-localised protein folding machinery, resulting in enzyme insufficiency, lysosomal glycolipid storage and subsequent pathology Replacement therapy for inherited enzyme deficiency--macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase for Gaucher's disease. Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher's disease, the most prevalent of the sphingolipid storage disorders, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase). Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the enzyme deficient in Gaucher's disease (GD) are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. Gaucher's disease is caused by deficient lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity. Functional glucocerebrosidase is deficient in Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder that affects people of all ethnic backgrounds, but has a higher incidence among East European Jews (Ashkenazim). We studied two patients with type IV glycogen storage disease 37 and 91 months after liver transplantation and a third patient with lysosomal glucocerebrosidase deficiency (type 1 Gaucher's disease), in whom tissue glucocerebroside deposition had decreased 26 months after liver replacement, to determine whether the migration of cells from the allograft (microchimerism) could explain the improved metabolism of enzyme-deficient tissues in the recipient.

54f60ae05f206a0c06000008	What is the substrate of the microbial enzyme inulinase?	Inulinases mainly produced by the microorganism and it degrades inulin into fructose which is a digestible form.   Inulin or inulin-rich materials can be actively hydrolyzed by microbial inulinases to produce glucose and fructose syrups that can be used in bioprocesses.  The catalysts treated at these conditions in both fluids were then used for the production of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) using sucrose and inulin as substrates in aqueous and organic systems. This work is focused on the synthesis of the fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose and inulin, using free, immobilized and pre-treated immobilized inulinase Using inulinases from K. marxianus NRRL Y 7571, 11.89% of GF2 and 20.83% of GF3 were obtained, using inulin as substrate.  TLC analysis of end product revealed that inulinase hydrolyzed inulin exclusively into fructose.  One product was an endo-inulinase, and the other was a β-fructofuranosidase. Both enzymes worked together to effectively degrade inulin. The K (m) and V (max) values of the purified enzyme for inulin were 2.3 mg/mL and 4.8 mg/min, respectively. Fructans were extracted from Agave salmiana juice, characterized and subjected to hydrolysis process using a commercial inulinase preparation acting freely.  A comparatively lower Michaelis-Menten constant (2.15 mg/ml) and higher maximum initial velocity (115 µmol/min/mg of protein) for inulinase I on inulin demonstrated the exoinulinase's greater affinity for inulin substrate. Inulin was hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme, yielding d-fructose as the main product.  The inulinase acts on the beta-(2,1)-D-fructoside links in inulin releasing D-fructose.

This is the first case of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in the small intestine associated with amyloidosis in Korea MR enterography of small-bowel lymphoma: potential for suggestion of histologic subtype and the presence of underlying celiac disease. We describe the characteristics of small-bowel lymphoma on MR enterography, identifying a number of key features that may help the interpreting radiologist in suggesting the underlying histologic subtype and whether the presence of underlying celiac disease is likely. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Epidemiologic studies dating from the 1950s established its association with gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly small bowel lymphoma. An association between untreated coeliac disease and intestinal malignancy is well described so it is possible that patients with undiagnosed coeliac disease constitute a significant reservoir of preventable gastrointestinal malignancy. An increased incidence of small bowel lymphoma in patients with long-standing celiac sprue is well documented in the literature.

5ac37afc0340b9f058000002	What type of sequences do enhancers evolve from?	The sequences of some gene regulatory elements diverge considerably, even between closely related species.  The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes.  These studies have identified enhancers that were pivotal for morphological divergence and highlighted how novel genetic networks shaping form emerged from pre-existing ones. Most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral DNA exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. santomea enhancer activity evolved from a weak ancestral activity.

532670e7d6d3ac6a34000008	What is the typical alteration of the thyroid profile metabolism early after coronary artery bypass graft surgery?	FT3 concentration dropped significantly (p < 0.0001), reaching its lowest value 12 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences between CPB and OPCAB patients.  In on-pump CABG surgery, inflammatory effects encompass activation of total leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets, reduction of serum level of total proteins and albumin and decreased thyroid hormones levels, especially within first postoperative 24 hours. Typical NTIS was observed in all patients, and the FT3 concentration was still reduced by postoperative day 5 (p<0.0001). We could demonstrate that CPB induces a low T3 syndrome up to 3 days after surgery. Those patients with low T3 concentrations prior to surgery demonstrate postoperatively a more severe degree of nonthyroidal illness (NTI). It is concluded that the coronary bypass operation evokes a rapid decline in T3, which is not normalized by the TSH induced response of the thyroid gland, while the post-operative period is characterized by a "low T3 state".

5a4df811966455904c00000e	Which RNA polymerase II subunit carries RNA cleavage activity?	In contrast, Pol II is fully protected through association with the cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS, which enables rapid recovery from any depth by RNA cleavage. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage.   This mutant enzyme can respond to SII for transcriptional read-through and carry out SII-activated nascent RNA cleavage.  In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription, readthrough or cleavage. In vitro characterization of mutant yeast RNA polymerase II with reduced binding for elongation factor TFIIS. The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II.  Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. The transcription elongation factor S-II, also designated TFIIS, stimulates the nascent transcript cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II itself may contain a Zn ribbon, in as much as the polymerase's 15-kDa subunit contains a sequence that aligns well with the TFIIS Zn ribbon sequence, including a similarly placed pair of acidic residues. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1991) J. Biol. The RNA cleavage activity of RNA polymerase III is mediated by an essential TFIIS-like subunit and is important for transcription termination. In the resulting model of Pol I, the C-terminal ribbon (C-ribbon) domain of A12.2 reaches the active site via the polymerase pore, like the C-ribbon of the Pol II cleavage factor TFIIS, explaining why the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I is strong, in contrast to the weak cleavage activity of Pol II. The amino and carboxyl regions of C11 are homologous to domains of the pol II subunit Rpb9p, and the pol II elongation and RNA cleavage factor, TFIIS, respectively.	['TFIIS']

530cf4e0c8a0b4a00c000002	How is connected "isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy" with dilated cardiomyopathy?	A novel alpha-tropomyosin mutation associates with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy and diminishes actin binding We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM, probably as a result of diminished actin binding caused by weakened charge-charge interactions. We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of NCCM and suggest that the molecular classification of cardiomyopathies includes an MYH7-associated spectrum of NCCM with HCM, RCM, and DCM.

56c1d857ef6e394741000033	What enzyme is inhibied by Opicapone?	PURPOSE: Opicapone (OPC) is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to be used as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease.  Brain and peripheral pharmacokinetics of levodopa in the cynomolgus monkey following administration of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the systemic and central bioavailability of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (levodopa) and related metabolites in the cynomolgus monkey. CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone behaved as long-acting COMT inhibitor that markedly increased systemic and central levodopa bioavailability.  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel third generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to compare the levodopa pharmacokinetic profile throughout a day driven by the COMT inhibition either following repeated doses of opicapone or concomitant administration with entacapone. CONCLUSION: Opicapone, a novel third generation COMT inhibitor, when compared to entacapone, provides a superior response upon the bioavailability of levodopa associated to more pronounced, long-lasting, and sustained COMT inhibition.  Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of opicapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, in healthy subjects: prediction of slow enzyme-inhibitor complex dissociation of a short-living and very long-acting inhibitor. Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Opicapone is a novel third generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers.  AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and inhibitory effect on erythrocyte soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) activity following repeated doses of opicapone.  CONCLUSION: Despite its short elimination half-life, opicapone markedly and sustainably inhibited erythrocyte S-COMT activity making it suitable for a once daily regimen. Opicapone demonstrated marked and sustained inhibition of erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. The long duration of COMT inhibition by opicapone, however, tended to be independent from the dose taken.

58b6cd3222d300530900000d	Which ApoE isoform is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease?	Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective. Importantly, lipoproteins containing the apoE3 isoform had higher TGF-beta levels and bioactivity than those containing apoE4, a major genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.  ApoE4 is positively associated with atherosclerosis and late-onset and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist.  Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The apolipoprotein E (apoE) type epsilon 4 isoform specifies increased cerebral and cerebrovascular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (A beta) and contributes to the genetic susceptibility underlying a large proportion (approximately 60%) of typical, sporadic Alzheimer disease. The structural preference of apoE4 to remain functional in solution may explain the enhanced opportunity of apoE4 isoform to display its pathophysiologic functions in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele is associated with Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and decreased longevity. The apolipoprotein E type 4 allele is a susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele is the strongest risk factor of sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD), however, the fluid concentrations of ApoE and its different isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4) in AD patients and among APOE genotypes (APOE ε2, ε3, ε4) remain controversial Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease (AD) Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective.  Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease.  The apoE4 allele is a major risk factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with a poor outcome after brain injury.  Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective. Importantly, lipoproteins containing the apoE3 isoform had higher TGF-beta levels and bioactivity than those containing apoE4, a major genetic risk factor for atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

The decreased antioxidant activity of E4 could contribute to its association with Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease and decreased longevity. The isoform apoE4 is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and it has been postulated that high intracellular cholesterol levels promote the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. Among three ɛ2, ɛ3, ɛ4 alleles, ɛ4 allele is associated with the increase in cholesterol level, risk of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease, while ɛ2 allele is associated with the decrease in cholesterol level and risk of atherosclerosis. Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. The structural preference of apoE4 to remain functional in solution may explain the enhanced opportunity of apoE4 isoform to display its pathophysiologic functions in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease..

515dd3d5298dcd4e5100001c	In what proportion of children with heart failure has Enalapril been shown to be safe and effective?	The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year Patients with intraatrial baffle procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have diastolic dysfunction, decreased exercise capacity, stroke volume response and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed. A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function. Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure. Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure. Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery. Renal failure was a problem in young infants with left-to-right shunts. In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril. The median age was 5.4 months. All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%. Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3). Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome. The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0.30 (0.21) mg/kg/day. Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril. We studied the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in eight infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics, treated orally with 0.25 mg kg-1 enalapril maleate once a day In infants with CHF, mean baseline ACE activity was significantly higher than in control infants Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit "heart failure" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.

Jun and Fos transcriptional activities are also regulated by phosphorylation as a result of the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. In this regard, the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-induced JNK has been readily documented, whereas a role for Fos proteins in UV-mediated responses and the identification of Fos-activating kinases has remained elusive An in vitro kinase assay revealed that the resultant c-Jun phosphorylation was primarily mediated via activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway forms part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways comprising a sequential three-tiered kinase cascade.  The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and are activated by environmental stress. JNK phosphorylates and regulates the activity of transcription factors other than c-Jun, including ATF2, Elk-1, p53 and c-Myc and non-transcription factors, such as members of the Bcl-2 family. A candidate for this extended family of MAP kinases is the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Jnk), which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun at the activating sites Ser-63 and Ser-73.

5506c3e38e1671127b00000a	The small molecule SEA0400 is an inhibitor of which ion antiporter/exchanger?	The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional ion transporter that couples the translocation of Na(+) in one direction with that of Ca(2+) in the opposite direction. This system contributes to the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration via the forward mode (Ca(2+) efflux) or the reverse mode (Ca(2+) influx). Concerning the role of NCX in NO cytotoxicity, we have found, using the specific inhibitor of NCX 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), that NCX is involved in NO-induced cytotoxicity in cultured microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. SEA0400 (1 μM), a pharmacological inhibitor of NCX, significantly shortened the MAP duration (P < .01) and reduced dispersion (P < .05).  We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specific NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mice. The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. In view of the previous observation that NO stimulates the activity of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), this study examines the involvement of NCX in cytotoxicity. The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability.  The sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) is one of the transporters contributing to the control of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration by normally mediating net Ca(2+) efflux. However, the reverse mode of the NCX can cause intracellular Ca(2+) concentration overload, which exacerbates the myocardial tissue injury resulting from ischemia. Although the NCX inhibitor SEA0400 has been shown to therapeutically reduce myocardial injury, no in vivo technique exists to monitor intracellular Ca(2+) fluctuations produced by this drug. We examined the involvement of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in the automaticity of the pulmonary vein myocardium with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. We investigated the expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the functional role of NCX in retinal damage by using NCX1-heterozygous deficient mice (NCX1(+/-)) and SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy] phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline), a selective NCX inhibitor in vivo.  SEA0400 is a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger having equal potencies to suppress both the forward and reverse mode operation of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Involvement of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in ouabain-induced inotropy and arrhythmogenesis was examined with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. In right ventricular papillary muscle isolated from guinea-pig ventricle, 1 microM SEA0400, which specifically inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by 80%, reduced the ouabain (1 microM)-induced positive inotropy by 40%, but had no effect on the inotropy induced by 100 microM isobutyl methylxantine. The effects of SEA0400, a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), on Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) uptake and catecholamine (CA) release were examined in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that were loaded with Na(+) by treatment with ouabain and veratridine. SEA0400 inhibited Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake and CA release, with the IC(50) values of 40 and 100 nM, respectively. Given the potential clinical benefit of inhibiting Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity during myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R), pharmacological approaches have been pursued to both inhibit and clarify the importance of this exchanger. SEA0400 was reported to have a potent NCX selectivity. Thus, we examined the effect of SEA0400 on NCX currents and I/R induced intracellular Ca2+ overload in mouse ventricular myocytes using patch clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements. The results suggested that SEA0400 is a potent NCX inhibitor, which can protect mouse cardiac myocytes from Ca2+ overload during I/R injuries. The effect of SEA0400, a novel Na+-Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, on mechanical and electrophysiological parameters of coronary-perfused guinea-pig right ventricular tissue preparation was examined during no-flow ischemia and reperfusion. The Ca2+ overload by Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a critical mechanism in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We investigated protective effects of a novel selective inhibitor of NCX, SEA0400, on cardiac function and energy metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion. The cardioprotective effects of SEA0400, a novel Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, were examined in isolated guinea pig myocardial tissue and ventricular myocytes. The effects of a new, potent, and selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, SEA-0400 (SEA), on steady-state outward (forward exchange), inward (reverse exchange), and Ca(2+)/Ca(2+) transport exchange modes were studied in internally dialyzed squid giant axons from both the extra- and intracellular sides. Inhibition by SEA takes place preferentially from the intracellular side of the membrane. Using SEA0400, a potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), we examined whether NCX is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced disturbance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis followed by apoptosis in cultured rat microglia. Activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may contribute to Ca2+ overload during reperfusion after transient ischemia. We examined the effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a selective inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, on a canine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (myocardial stunning). SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline) has recently been described as a potent and selective inhibitor of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange in cardiac, neuronal, and renal preparations. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 were investigated on the cloned cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, NCX1.1, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to gain insight into its inhibitory mechanism. The effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a newly synthesized Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, on the NCX current and other membrane currents were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and compared with those of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy) phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). SEA0400 concentration-dependently inhibited the NCX current with a 10 fold higher potency than that of KB-R7943; 1 microM SEA0400 and 10 microM KB-R7943 inhibited the NCX current by more than 80%. KB-R7943, at 10 microM, inhibited the sodium current, L-type calcium current, delayed rectifier potassium current and inwardly rectifying potassium current by more than 50%, but SEA0400 (1 microM) had no significant effect on these currents. These results indicate that SEA0400 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of NCX, and would be a powerful tool for further studies on the role of NCX in the heart and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition. The effect of the newly synthesized compound 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was investigated and compared against that of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined. SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively. SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the Ca2+ channels, Na+ channels, K+ channels, norepinephrine transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and five enzymes. These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage.

56cdf4875795f9a73e000040	Which domain of TIA-1 is necessary for stress granule assembly?	Tia1/Pub1 is a stress granule component carrying a Q/N-rich prion domain Codependent functions of RSK2 and the apoptosis-promoting factor TIA-1 in stress granule assembly and cell survival We report an unanticipated link between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1 Stress granule assembly is mediated by prion-like aggregation of TIA-1 TIA-1 is an RNA binding protein that promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs), discrete cytoplasmic inclusions into which stalled translation initiation complexes are dynamically recruited in cells subjected to environmental stress. The RNA recognition motifs of TIA-1 are linked to a glutamine-rich prion-related domain (PRD). Truncation mutants lacking the PRD domain do not induce spontaneous SGs and are not recruited to arsenite-induced SGs, whereas the PRD forms aggregates that are recruited to SGs in low-level-expressing cells but prevent SG assembly in high-level-expressing cells The PRD of TIA-1 exhibits many characteristics of prions: concentration-dependent aggregation that is inhibited by the molecular chaperone heat shock protein (HSP)70; resistance to protease digestion; sequestration of HSP27, HSP40, and HSP70; and induction of HSP70, a feedback regulator of PRD disaggregation. Substitution of the PRD with the aggregation domain of a yeast prion, SUP35-NM, reconstitutes SG assembly, confirming that a prion domain can mediate the assembly of SGs Our results reveal that prion-like aggregation of TIA-1 regulates SG formation downstream of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in response to stress Stress granule assembly is mediated by prion-like aggregation of TIA-1.  TIA-1 is an RNA binding protein that promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs), discrete cytoplasmic inclusions into which stalled translation initiation complexes are dynamically recruited in cells subjected to environmental stress.

58853c56e56acf5176000018	What is the role of DNA Repair Cofactors ATMIN and NBS1?	DNA Repair Cofactors ATMIN and NBS1 Are Required to Suppress T Cell Activation. Here, we investigate the roles of ATMIN and NBS1, either alone or in combination, using murine models. We show loss of NBS1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive stage of T cell development, as well as reduced TCRα recombination, that was unexpectedly neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In contrast, loss of both ATMIN and NBS1 enhanced DNA damage that drove spontaneous peripheral T cell hyperactivation, proliferation as well as excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a highly inflammatory environment. Intriguingly, the disease causing T cells were largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS1. In vivo this resulted in severe intestinal inflammation, colitis and premature death. Our findings reveal a novel model for an intestinal bowel disease phenotype that occurs upon combined loss of the DNA repair cofactors ATMIN and NBS1.

56c1f03bef6e394741000053	Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome?	 The disorder is caused by mutations to the NKX2.1 (TITF1) gene and also forms part of the "brain-lung-thyroid syndrome", in which additional developmental abnormalities of lung and thyroid tissue are observed.  Novel NKX2-1 Frameshift Mutations in Patients with Atypical Phenotypes of the Brain-Lung-Thyroid Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To verify the involvement of NKX2-1 gene in infants with brain-lung-thyroid (BLT) syndrome and hypothyroid phenotypes variable among congenital hypothyroidism (CH) or idiopathic mild hypothyroidism (IMH) of postnatal onset. They were carriers of new de novo heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 (c.177delG and c.153_166del14). CONCLUSIONS: Two novel heterozygous frameshift mutations of NKX2-1 were identified in 2 cases selected on the basis of a BLT-like phenotype among 183 hypothyroid infants.  NKX2-1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: a case series of four patients. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (BLTS) characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, respiratory distress syndrome, and benign hereditary chorea is caused by thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TTF1) mutations. Two of the four patients presenting with the triad of BLTS had NKX2-1 mutations, and one of these NKX2-1 [c.890_896del (p.Ala327Glyfs*52)] is a novel variant. The third patient without any identified NKX2-1 mutations was a carrier of mitochondrial mutation; this raises the possibility of mitochondrial mutations contributing to thyroid dysgenesis. Although rare, the triad of congenital hypothyroidism, neurological, and respiratory signs is highly suggestive of NKX2-1 anomalies. Screening for NKX2-1 mutations in patients with thyroid, lung, and neurological abnormalities will enable a unifying diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected families. In addition, identification of an NKX2-1 defect would be helpful in allaying the concerns about inadequate thyroxine supplementation as the cause of neurological defects observed in some children with congenital hypothyroidism. Loss-of-function mutations in NKX2.1, a gene vital to the normal development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid, have been identified in a number of individuals. BACKGROUND: NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. CONCLUSION: MLPA should be considered as a complementary tool in patients with partial or total brain-lung-thyroid syndrome when direct sequencing failed to identify NKX2.1 mutations.  Mutations in NKX2-1 cause neurological, pulmonary, and thyroid hormone impairment. Recently, the disease was named brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  Genetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in two patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb deletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient. Congenital hypothyroidism was not detected on neonatal screening in the patient with the missense mutation, and frequent respiratory infections were observed in the patient with the deletion in NKX2-1.  Haploinsufficiency of NKX2.1, the gene encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)--critical for lung, thyroid and central nervous system morphogenesis and function--causes a rare form of progressive respiratory failure designated brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.  We report a novel TTF-1 molecular defect causing recurrent respiratory failure episodes in an infant. In conclusion, ILD in patients with NKX2-1 mutations was associated with altered surfactant protein metabolism, and both gain and loss of function of the mutated NKX2-1 genes on surfactant protein promoters were associated with ILD in "Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome". Thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TITF1) mutations cause brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, characterized by congenital hypothyroidism (CH), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC). The objectives of the present study were (i) detection of NKX2-1 mutations in patients with CH associated with pneumopathy and/or BHC, (ii) functional analysis of new mutations in vitro and (iii) description of the phenotypic spectrum of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Five new TTF1/NKX2.1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: rescue by PAX8 synergism in one case.

Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification improves the detection rate of NKX2.1 mutations in patients affected by brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. NKX2.1 mutations have been identified in patients displaying complete or partial brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which can include benign hereditary chorea (BHC), hypothyroidism and/or lung disease. The clinical spectrum of 6 own and 40 published patients with NKX2-1 mutations ranged from the complete triad of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (50%), brain and thyroid disease (30%), to isolated BHC (13%).

550342a8f8aee20f27000002	Which is the major symptom of the Doose syndrome?	KD is particularly effective in myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE; Doose Syndrome) and West syndrome with 100% and 81.25% of the patients having a greater than 50% seizure reduction, respectively.  Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) - a lamotrigine responsive epilepsy? PURPOSE: Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome) is a difficult to treat idiopathic generalized epilepsy of early childhood. Herman Doose first described the generalized childhood epilepsy syndrome of myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE) in 1970, attributing a genetic cause from this first description.  RECENT FINDINGS: In the past several years, neurologists are finding new indications to use these dietary treatments, perhaps even as first-line therapy, including infantile spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), Dravet syndrome, and status epilepticus (including FIRES syndrome). First long-term experience with the orphan drug rufinamide in children with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome). INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the orphan drug rufinamide (RUF) in children with pharmacoresistant myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome). Mutations in SCN1A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel α1-subunit, are found to be associated with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy or Dravet syndrome (DS), but only rarely with the myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE, or Doose syndrome).  The difficulty early in the course of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is distinguishing this diagnosis from severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) or from myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), as the seizure patterns in these three syndromes may overlap at the onset.  Doose syndrome (myoclonic-astatic epilepsy): 40 years of progress. Doose syndrome, otherwise traditionally known as myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, was first described as a unique epilepsy syndrome by Dr Hermann Doose in 1970. Of 38 patients, 22 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (58%); 6 had myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose (16%); 5 had symptomatic generalized epilepsy, not otherwise specified (13%); and 5 had symptomatic localization-related epilepsy (13%).  With felbamate treatment, 6 patients (16%) became seizure free, including 4 of the 6 patients with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose; 24 patients (63%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Less commonly observed phenotypes include myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE or Doose syndrome), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), infantile spasms, and vaccine-related encephalopathy and seizures. This includes syndromes with multiple etiologies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms; developmental syndromes of unknown etiology, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome; and idiopathic epilepsies, such as myoclonic-astatic (Doose) epilepsy.  It should be considered early in the treatment of Dravet syndrome and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome).  The purpose of this article is to present a short review of the natural history of myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE; Doose syndrome) and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).  [Clinical case of the month. Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy in a young child (MAE) or Doose syndrome]. His refractory epilepsy which started 7 years ago shares symptoms and signs of both epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures (Doose Syndrome) and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. PURPOSE: Before 1986, the spectrum of childhood epilepsies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Doose syndrome (DS), known collectively as "epilepsia myoclonica astatica," was believed to represent a single disease.  We reported a 7-year-old girl with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of early childhood (Doose syndrome).  Other myoclonic epilepsy syndromes with onset in the first year of life (Aicardi's Neonatal (Early) Myoclonic Encephalopathy, West's Syndrome, Dravet's Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy, and Dravet's Benign Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy), in early childhood (Lennox-Gastaut-Dravet Syndrome, Myoclonic Variant of Lennox Gastaut Dravet Syndrome, Myoclonic-Astatic Epilepsy of Doose, Benign Myoclonic Epilepsies (BME), or even in late childhood (Childhood Absence Epilepsy with myoclonias, vs. Myoclonic Absence Epilepsy) are probably genetically complex diseases.  A study of epileptic drop attacks (EDA) by simultaneous video-polygraphic recordings was carried out in one epileptic patient with myoclonic astatic seizures (Doose syndrome).  A number of variants or atypical forms have been proposed. As a result, differential diagnosis presents a major challenge and includes specific generalized epilepsies, i.e., metabolic or inflammatory; secondarily generalized epilepsies, i.e., those arising from the frontal lobe; and severe forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, i.e., Doose syndrome. Video-EEG analysis of drop seizures in myoclonic astatic epilepsy of early childhood (Doose syndrome).  The clinical and EEG pattern, the high familial incidence are shared by the Doose syndrome, of which the present series seems to be a subgroup, as are other well-defined syndromes: benign and severe myoclonic epilepsies of infancy.

5ace37d50340b9f058000011	Which is the main reason for the increase in the incidence of cryptococcal disease?	The incidence of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans has increased four-fold in the last decade. It is an increasing cause of infection in immunosuppressed patients, most notably those with HIV infection. Currently, 4.0% patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom are known to have developed cryptococcosis. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Cryptococcal disease is an opportunistic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in adults with HIV. Primary prophylaxis with antifungal interventions may decrease cryptococcal disease incidence and associated mortality.<br><b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To assess the efficacy of antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV.<br><b>SEARCH STRATEGY</b>: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ClinicalTrials.gov, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on the Health Sciences (LILACS), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). When the two studies using fluconazole as the intervention were analyzed together (N=518), the incidence of cryptococcal disease was decreased in those taking fluconazole for primary prophylaxis (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07, 0.87) compared to those taking placebo; however, there was no significant difference in overall mortality (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14, 2.62).<br><b>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS</b>: Antifungal primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease. Key words used include: meningitis, cryptococcal, cryptococcus, cryptococcosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, prophylaxis, chemoprevention, antifungal agents, and the Cochrane screen for randomized controlled trials.<br><b>SELECTION CRITERIA</b>: Randomized controlled trials using antifungal interventions for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults with HIV were selected.<br><b>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</b>: Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. AIDS is the main predisposing condition for cryptococcal meningitis, and thus the profile of most patients mirrors that of HIV infection. We reviewed abstracts from the following relevant conferences: International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Antifungal primary prophylaxis with either itraconazole or fluconazole is effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcal disease in adults with advanced HIV disease. BACKGROUND Cryptococcal meningitis is a common opportunistic infection in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased in parallel with that of HIV infection. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus spp., is the most common form of meningitis and a leading cause of death among persons with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors observed no differences in the radiographic appearances of pulmonary cryptococcal disease between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and other immunocompromised individuals. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has increased in parallel with that of HIV infection. Despite advances in the treatment of HIV disease, the incidence and mortality of invasive cryptococcal disease remain significant.	['HIV infection', 'HIV']
5aac543bfcf4565872000004	What biologic process in the body is associated with Mast cells?	Mast cells (MCs) may play an important role in plaque destabilization and atherosclerotic coronary complications. Mast cells are significantly involved in IgE-mediated allergic reactions  Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa Mast cells and basophils are innate immune cells with overlapping functions that contribute to anti-helminth immunity.  Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body, predominantly near blood vessels and nerves, and express effector functions in allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, and host defense. The mast cell is the cellular basis for immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells are important elements of the body response to foreign antigens, being those represented either by small molecules (allergic response) or harbored by foreign microorganisms (response to parasite infection). Mast cells are ubiquitous in the body and multifunctional immune cells; they are known to be primary responders in allergic reactions, orchestrating strong responses to minute amounts of allergens. In IgE-associated biological responses, the crosslinking of Fc&#949;RI-bound IgE with multivalent antigens initiate the activation of mast cells by promoting aggregation of FceRI. Mast cell activation has been shown to be an initiator and a key determinant of foreign body reactions Mast cells are one of the major effector cells in the pathogenesis of the immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction in a number of non-allergic immune disorders as well as in normal physiological processes.  Mast cells act as sensors in innate immunity and as effector cells in adaptive immune reactions.  : Allergic rhinitis is characterized by the epithelial accumulation of cells, particularly mast cells and eosinophils. Mast cells are important effector cells of the immune system and recent studies show that they have immunomodulatory roles in diverse processes in both health and disease. Biological functions of mast cells appear to include a role in innate immunity, involvement in host defense mechanisms against parasitic infestations, immunomodulation of the immune system, and tissue repair and angiogenesis Mast cells have long been known to play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of IgE-associated allergic disorders by their ability to release a wide variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. Mast cells are long-lived resident cells that are of great importance in an allergic reaction. Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased mast cell numbers and upregulation of the TNF receptor family member CD30, but the role of elevated CD30 expression is poorly understood.

An ultrasound evaluation of the carpal tunnel can assess for pathologic changes of the median nerve, detect secondary causes of CTS, and aid in surgical planning. Carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which median nerve compression results in paresthesias and pain in the wrist and hand. All patients underwent ultrasound with measurement of the surface of the median nerve at the entrance of the carpal tunnel and electroneuromyographic examination of both wrists. Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction of the hand. BACKGROUND: Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction of the hand. SION: Open carpel tunnel release surgery is an effective procedure for compression neuropathy of the median nerve. It sh Carpel tunnel release surgery (CTRS) was performed and in the stimulation group of patients, stainless steel electrode wires placed alongside the median nerve proximal to the surgical decompression site for immediate 1 h 20 Hz bipolar ES. BACKGROUND: Carpel tunnel syndrome is a common compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness and functional dysfunction  Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve  Carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which median nerve compression results in paresthesias and pain in the wrist and hand.  nslated these findings to human patients by examining the number of reinnervated motor units in the median nerve-innervated thenar muscles before and after carpel tunnel release surgery in a randomized controlled trial. Moto tunnel release surgery (CTRS) was performed and in the stimulation group of patients, stainless steel electrode wires placed alongside the median nerve proximal to the surgical decompression site for immediate 1 h 20 Hz bipolar ES. Subjects OBJECTIVES: To provide a quantitative analysis of ultrasonographic measurements and possible pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome by comparing cross-sectional areas of the median nerve, carpal tunnel, and nerve/tunnel index and the difference in ultrasonographic findings between affected and nonaffected hands and between sexes. We studied the SSR evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve and recording from the contralateral hands in 30 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) without clinical autonomic signs and compared the results to the SSR in 30 normal controls. This pattern is consistent with compression of both the anterior and posterior aspects of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel because nerve fibers responsible for thenar, lumbrical, and digit 2 functions lie in an anterior-posterior gradient within the distal median nerve. RESULTS: Comparison between normative (n=24) and abnormal hands (n=78) revealed the following: the mean proximal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve, carpal tunnel, and nerve/tunnel index of electrodiagnostically normative hands were 10.941mm(2), 192.43mm(2), and 5.635%, respectively, whereas those of abnormal hands were 13.74mm(2), 208.87mm(2), and 6.693%, respectively, showing statistically significant differences for all (P<.05) Sympathetic vasomotor fibres of the median nerve are affected in carpal tunnel syndrome. The sympathetic vasomotor fibres of the median nerve were evaluated in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and in healthy volunteers using continuous wave Doppler ultrasonography. INTRODUCTION: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy caused by compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. n carpel tunnel release surgery is an effective procedure for compression neuropathy of the median nerve. It BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition (prevalence of 4%) where the median nerve is compressed within the carpal tunnel resulting in numbness, tingling, and pain  Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve a The carpal tunnel syndrome usually affects women aged between 40 and 60 years, and presents typically as parasthesia of the fingers, mainly at night, in the regions served by the median nerve, sometimes associated with hypoesthesia and difficulty in movements.

5880c42fc872c95565000008	Which disease is treated with semaglutide?	INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are increasingly being used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but consideration of benefits and potential adverse events is required. This review examines the state of glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, and tolerability, as well as the current debate about the safety of GLP-1 RAs, including risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer.METHODS: A MEDLINE search (2010-2015) identified publications that discussed longer-acting GLP-1 RAs. Search terms included GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, efficacy, safety, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer.  Seven trials have been published that have established CV safety for three DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, and sitagliptin), three GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide), and one sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin). Three of those studies also established superiority with liraglutide, empagliflozin, and semaglutide at reducing the composite primary endpoint of major CV events (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke).  RECENT FINDINGS: In response to guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration, thousands of patients have been enrolled in large randomized trials evaluating the cardiovascular effects of the three newest diabetes drug classes: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Two studies of GLP-1 receptor agonists-one of liraglutide and one of semaglutide-have shown cardiovascular benefit relative to placebo, and one study of the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin has shown benefit. New antidiabetic drugs are being developed today that expand the range of pharmacological intervention, in particular for patients with type 2 diabetes (imeglimin, semaglutide, dulaglutide, FGF 21 analogue). The effect of semaglutide, a once-weekly human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog in development for type 2 diabetes (T2D), on the bioavailability of a combined oral contraceptive was investigated.  Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was significantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide than among those receiving placebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide. Postmenopausal women with T2D (n = 43) on diet/exercise ± metformin received ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg)/levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) once daily for 8 days before (semaglutide-free) and during (steady-state 1.0 mg) semaglutide treatment (subcutaneous once weekly; dose escalation: 0.25 mg 4 weeks; 0.5 mg 4 weeks; 1.0 mg 5 weeks).

550c3754a103b78016000007	Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?	Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms. The majority of cases are idiopathic and characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing fibrillar α-synuclein Parkinson's disease is characterized by α-synuclein pathology in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites Parkinson's disease is characterized by neuronal death in the substantia nigra and the presence of intracellular inclusions of α-synuclein in the Lewy bodies Parkinson's disease, also known as paralysis agitans, is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, with onset usually between the ages of 50 and 65 years, and is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the subsantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies The protein α-synuclein is well recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies are common disorders of the aging population and characterized by the progressive accumulation of �-synuclein (�-syn) in the central nervous system. AF-LB and Parkinsons disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by abnormal deposition of �-synuclein aggregates in many regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. A number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy are characterized by the formation and intraneuronal accumulation of fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) protein in affected brain regions. They have been a long time the hallmark of Parkinsons disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system. BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinsons Disease (PD). Although Parkinsons disease with later dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are pathologically characterized by the presence of intraneuronal Lewy inclusion bodies, amyloid deposition is also associated to varying degrees with both these disorders. Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegnerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. However, it seems that Braak staging can not explain difference in severity of autonomic failure between DLB and PD. As a possibility, in DLB patients with significant autonomic failure, Lewy bodies may have been localized to the peripheral autonomic nervous system in a long time before onset of dementia or parkinsonism, and propagation of Lewy bodies into the central nervous system may be initiated by apparition of certain promotion factor, such as ageing and amyloid-�. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy bodies in the surviving SN neurons, as well as other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system These include multiple system atrophy (MSA), characterized by accumulation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and Lewy body disorders, including Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and the so-called "pure" autonomic failure	["Parkinson's disease (PD)"]

571f33bd0fd6f91b68000003	Which gene is responsible for the development of Sotos syndrome?	Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome characterized by excessive growth during childhood, macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and learning disability. This disorder is caused by mutations or deletions in NSD1 gene Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts for a majority of patients with SoS Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome. The NSD1 gene was recently found to be responsible for Sotos syndrome, and more than 150 patients with NSD1 alterations have been identified. Recently, deletions encompassing the nuclear receptor binding SET-Domain 1 (NSD1) gene have been described as the major cause of Japanese patients with the Sotos syndrome, whereas point mutations have been identified in the majority of European Sotos syndrome patients. Mutations in NSD1 are responsible for Sotos syndrome, but are not a frequent finding in other overgrowth phenotypes. Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. Two cases of Sotos syndrome with novel mutations of the NSD1 gene. Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors.  Clinical and genetic spectrum of 18 unrelated Korean patients with Sotos syndrome: frequent 5q35 microdeletion and identification of four novel NSD1 mutations. Craniofacial and oral features of Sotos syndrome: differences in patients with submicroscopic deletion and mutation of NSD1 gene. Prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a 1.07-Mb microdeletion at 5q35.2-q35.3 associated with NSD1 haploinsufficiency and Sotos syndrome. Autosomal dominant mutations and deletions of the nuclear receptor set domain gene (NSD1), which is located at chromosome 5q35, are responsible for most of the cases.  There are two types of mutations that cause NSD1 haploinsufficiency: mutations within the NSD1 gene (mutation type) and a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene (deletion type).  Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth associated with macrocephaly and delayed psychomotor development. Patients with Sotos syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving NSD1 or its point mutations. Mutations in NSD1 are responsible for Sotos syndrome, Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome.

512d2fff5274a5fb07000006	Is the H3K4me3 histone mark related to transcriptional initiation or elongation?	The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes Trimethylation of histone H3 Lys 4 (H3K4me3) is a mark of active and poised promoters. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is well known to occur in the promoter region of genes for transcription activation 3'-H3K4me3 is associated with ~15% of protein-coding genes in both tissues Furthermore, 3'-H3K4me3 modification levels correlate positively with the antisense expression levels of the associated sense genes, implying that 3'-H3K4me3 is involved in the activation of antisense transcription. Among these are forms of histone 3 that are mono- or tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1 or H3K4me3, respectively), which bind preferentially to promoter and enhancer elements in the mammalian genome we find that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 are enriched at transcriptional start sites in the genome H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 generally mark cis regulatory elements	['transcriptional initiation']

Preoperatively, urethral mobility was measured by Q tip test. Valsalva leak point pressure-associated Q-tip angle and simple female stress urinary incontinence symptoms. PURPOSE: To clarify the association between clinically defined simple stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms and urodynamic SUI, we examined the relationship between Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) as measured by the Q-tip test and Stamey grade in simple female SUI.METHODS: Two hundred grade I or II female SUI patients with SUI symptom were examined by reviewing medical history; physical examination; urethral mobility as assessed by Q-tip test; stress test; and cystometry, including VLPP measurement.  CONCLUSIONS: In simple female SUI, VLPP is associated with the Q-tip angle and Stamey grade, which may help to reduce some of urodynamic items. Each woman at 12 and 24 months underwent postoperative evaluation by means of urodynamics, Q-tip test, CST, transperineal ultrasonography, and administration of "King's Health Questionnaire" (KHQ). METHODS: A total of 25 women affected by clinical stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were enrolled. After undergoing urodynamic assessment, pelvic organ prolapse quantification, urine culture, Q-tip test, and stress test, each subject underwent color Doppler ultrasonography to record clitoral blood flow and EMG of the urethral sphincter with a needle electrode inserted through the mucosa into the muscle tissue before surgery.  Preoperatively, patients underwent POP-Q staging, Q-tip test, challenge stress test and urodynamics, and completed the I-QoL, PISQ-12, and PGI-S questionnaires. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients suffering from clinical and/or urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were randomized into biological material TOT (PELVILACE® TO) or synthetic material TOT (ALIGN®TO Urethral Support System) groups. Preoperative and at 1 year postoperative urogynecological symptom assessment, 1-h pad test, 4-day bladder diary, stress test, Q-tip test, and urodynamics were performed.  Role of the Q-tip test in evaluating stress urinary incontinence. Fifteen women with a clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence had a negative Q-tip test (greater than or equal to 30 degrees Q-tip angle change on straining). Simple clinical tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence.

Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 have recently been found in 25% of patients with either the dominant or the sporadic form. We also report the prevalence of RPS 19 mutations in the Italian DBA population, as shown by an analysis of 56 patients. Mutation of ribosomal protein RPS24 in Diamond-Blackfan anemia results in a ribosome biogenesis disorder. Three genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been associated to DBA: after RPS19, mutations in genes RPS24 and RPS17 were recently identified in a fraction of the patients. A transgenic mouse model demonstrates a dominant negative effect of a point mutation in the RPS19 gene associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited erythroblastopenia associated with mutations in at least 8 different ribosomal protein genes. Currently nine genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins (RP), have been found mutated in approximately 50% of patients.

Currently two genes are associated with the DBA phenotype--the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 mutated in 25% of DBA patients and RPS24 mutated in approximately 1.4% of DBA patients. DBA patients exhibit abnormal pre-rRNA maturation patterns and the majority bear mutations in one of several ribosomal protein genes that encode structural components of the ribosome essential for the correct assembly of the ribosomal subunits. The combination of sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of these six genes allows the genetic characterization of approximately 65% of patients, showing that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is indisputably a ribosomopathy.

58de18e48acda3452900002a	Which miRNA is targeted by SRY/Sox9?	Does the linear Sry transcript function as a ceRNA for miR-138? Recently, the sex determining region Y ( Sry) and the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 ( CDR1as) RNA transcripts have been described to function as a new class of post-transcriptional regulatory RNAs that behave as circular endogenous RNA sponges for the micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-138 and miR-7, respectively.   it is reasonable to think that the linear Sry sense transcript could additionally act as a miRNA sponge, or as an endogenous competing RNA for miR-138. Results indicated that miR-138 directly targeted SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and overexpression of SOX4 and HIF-1α effectively reversed the miR-138-mediated suppression of cell invasion. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.

5c73ad077c78d69471000090	Safinamide is approved for treatment of which disease?	Safinamide has been recently approved as an add-on to levodopa therapy for Parkinson disease.   These data are consistent with the anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian actions of safinamide and provide support for the nondopaminergic mechanism of its action. Safinamide: a new hope for Parkinson's disease? The loss of dopaminergic neurons (DAn) and reduced dopamine (DA) production underlies the reasoning behind the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) using levodopa (L-DOPA). Recently licensed by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), safinamide [a monoamine oxidase B (MOA-B) inhibitor] is an alternative to L-DOPA; as we discuss here, it enhances dopaminergic transmission with decreased secondary effects compared with L-DOPA.  Overall, safinamide can be considered to have potential antidyskinetic and neuroprotective effects and future trials and/or studies should be performed to provide further evidence for its potential as an anti-PD drug. Real life evaluation of safinamide effectiveness in Parkinson's disease. In this retrospective study, we evaluated both efficacy and effectiveness of safinamide 50 and 100 mg in the treatment of motor fluctuations and disabling dyskinesias in a cohort of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).  In conclusion, safinamide is safe and effective in improving motor complications in patients with idiopathic PD and can be considered a useful levodopa sparing strategy. Safinamide: an add-on treatment for managing Parkinson's disease. Safinamide (Xadago - Zambon S.p.A) is a monoamine-oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor licensed as add-on therapy for people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations with levodopa. In the EU, safinamide is approved for the treatment of mid- to late-stage fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) as add-on therapy to a stable dose of levodopa alone or in combination with other PD medications.

5a7346662dc08e987e00001a	What causes "Puffy hand syndrome"?	Intravenous drug addiction is responsible for many complications, especially cutaneous and infectious. There is a syndrome, rarely observed in rheumatology, resulting in "puffy hands": the puffy hand syndrome. They presented with an edema of the hands, bilateral, painless, no pitting, occurring in one of our patient during heroin intoxication, and in the other 2 years after stopping injections. In our two patients, additional investigations (biological, radiological, ultrasound) were unremarkable, which helped us, in the context, to put the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome.  Puffy hand syndrome develops after long-term intravenous drug addiction. The authors report an original clinical presentation of factitious disorders of the upper extremity in an ex-drug-addict patient with puffy hand syndrome.  Puffy hand syndrome is an unrecognized complication of intravenous drug abuse.  Puffy hand syndrome due to drug addiction: a case-control study of the pathogenesis. AIM: We studied the pathogenesis of puffy hand syndrome of intravenous drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Injection practices are likely to cause puffy hands syndrome, but buprenorphine misuse should not be considered as a significant risk factor. [Puffy hand syndrome in drug addiction treated by low-stretch bandages]. BACKGROUND: Puffy hand syndrome is a complication of intravenous drug abuse, which has no current available treatment. Physiopathological mechanisms of the puffy hand syndrome are unclear and include venous and lymphatic insufficiencies, infectious complications and direct toxicity of injected drugs and their adulterants. Puffy hand syndrome is a complication of intravenous drug abuse, which has no current available treatment. Puffy hand syndrome is an unrecognized complication of intravenous drug abuse. The puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard-core injection addicts. Other IVDA complications in the upper extremity affecting blood vessels and lymphatics include hematoma, arterial aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, "puffy hand" syndrome, and lymphadenopathy. <b>AIM</b>: We studied the pathogenesis of puffy hand syndrome of intravenous drug use. In 69.7% of the cases and 59.4% of the controls, respectively, there was a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine misuse, although it appeared not to be a significant risk factor for puffy hand syndrome.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Injection practices are likely to cause puffy hands syndrome, but buprenorphine misuse should not be considered as a significant risk factor. puffy hand syndrome is an unrecognized complication of intravenous drug abuse this painless syndrome appears during or after a long period of drug addiction it involves the hands and sometimes the forearms and may cause functional aesthetic and social disturbances when the hand volume is important physiopathological mechanisms of the puffy hand syndrome are unclear and include venous and lymphatic insufficiencies infectious complications and direct toxicity of injected drugs and their adulterants low stretch bandage and elastic garment usually used in lymphedema treatment are proposed to treat the puffy hand syndrome. we studied the pathogenesis of puffy hand syndrome of intravenous drug use we hypothesized that injections of high dose sublingual buprenorphine instead of the recommended sublingual administration could play an important role in lymphatic obstruction and destruction we set up a case control study in substitution centres recruiting intravenous drug addicts with and without puffy hands respectively the subjects were asked to answer anonymously a questionnaire of 40 items comprising social and demographic status history of illicit drugs use buprenorphine misuse and injection practices we included 33 cases and 33 controls mean age of 34 years they were past heroin users mainly methadone substituted in multivariate analysis sex women or 8 9 p 0 03 injections in the hands or 5 9 p 0 03 injections in the feet or 6 5 p 0 01 and the absence of tourniquet or 7 0 p 0 02 were significant risk factors for puffy hand syndrome in 69 7 of the cases and 59 4 of the controls respectively there was a high dose sublingual buprenorphine misuse although it appeared not to be a significant risk factor for puffy hand syndrome injection practices are likely to cause puffy hands syndrome but buprenorphine misuse should not be considered as a significant risk factor however intravenous drug users must still be warned of local and systemic complications of intravenous drug misuse. puffy hand in long term intravenous drug users narcotic addiction may induce systemic and local complications intravenous injections of drugs can cause venous thrombosis and septic or embolic complications the puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard core injection addicts three long term intravenous drug users two males one female mean age 30 6 years 26 37 presented puffy hands these patients had been drug addicts for four to twelve years mean duration 7 3 years and had stopped heroin injections for 3 5 years mean 4 6 participating in a buprenorphine substitution program the edema appeared several years after drug cessation 1 5 5 mean 2 3 typically the puffiness was bilateral the hands swollen from the proximal segments of the fingers to the wrist in one patient the edema was localized both in the hands and in the feet the edema was not pitting and unaffected by elevation duplex ultrasound examination of the extremities was normal lymphangiography performed in one patient was consistent with deep lymphatic destruction puffy hand syndrome appears to be the end result of lymphatic obstruction repeated injections of drugs in or outside the veins destroy the lymphatics buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign although it is supposed to be administered orally many drug addicts use it as an i v solution because buprenorphine is poorly soluble it causes lymphatic obstruction this type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires incision and drainage. puffy hand syndrome is a complication of intravenous drug abuse which has no current available treatment arm and forearm edema are voluminous and cause functional and aesthetic disturbances we report two cases successfully treated by low stretch bandages a 40 year old man and a 34 year old woman both intravenous drug users with puffy hand syndrome were hospitalized for 11 days treatment included daily multilayer bandaging lymphedema volumes calculated by utilizing the formula for a truncated cone decreased by 16 on the left side and 12 on the right side for the first patient and 31 and 17 for the second hand circumference decreased 4 3 cm on the left side and 3 2 cm on the right side in case 1 and 2 5 cm and 1 9 cm respectively for case 2 the patients were taught self bandaging techniques during their hospital stays elastic gloves were fitted at the end of treatment reduction of lymphedema volume remained stable after 18 months in one patient while for the second patient further treatment and hospitalization were required due to poor compliance the pathogenesis of this edema is probably multifactorial venous lymphatic insufficiency and the direct toxicity of injected drugs lymphedema treatment currently consists of low stretch bandaging and wearing elastic garments which is effective in decreasing the volume of puffy hand syndrome. the incidence of vascular complications due to drug abuse is at present increasing due to new types of drugs and to the different ways of intake of such substances the vascular complications related to drug abuse may affect venous arterious and lymphatic districts and in particular ischemia following intra arterial injections arterious and venous pseudoaneurysm vasculitis aneurysms aortic dissections abscesses complicated by erosions of vessels arteriovenous fistulas compartment syndrome superficial and deep venous thrombosis septic trombophlebitis puffy hand syndrome the scientific knowledge in this matter is incomplete because of the new pathological cases and the lack of information regarding the efficacy of different treatments the authors report four patients affected by vascular pathologies due to drug abuse in one case a heroin addict has undergone multiple fasciotomies for compartimental syndrome arising because the patient maintained an innatural posture for several hours during an overdose coma in a second case a segmental right subclavear deep venous thrombosis has been treated by pharmacological therapy with satisfactory functional recovery of the arm a third patient has been successfully submitted to intra arterial pharmacological vasodilatation for generalised lower limbs vasospasm caused by drug abuse in the last case the voluntary swallowing of a great dose of cocaine caused the patient s death after multiple ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral episodes after the description of these cases a review of the recent literature and some observations on this topic are presented a better knowledge of vascular complications due to drug abuse should improve the therapeutical approach of these patients. intravenous drug addiction is responsible for many complications especially cutaneous and infectious there is a syndrome rarely observed in rheumatology resulting in puffy hands the puffy hand syndrome we report two cases of this condition from our rheumatologic consultation our two patients had intravenous drug addiction they presented with an edema of the hands bilateral painless no pitting occurring in one of our patient during heroin intoxication and in the other 2 years after stopping injections in our two patients additional investigations biological radiological ultrasound were unremarkable which helped us in the context to put the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome the pathophysiology still unclear is based in part on a lymphatic toxicity of drugs and their excipients there is no etiological treatment but elastic compression by night has improved edema of the hands in one of our patients. puffy hand syndrome develops after long term intravenous drug addiction it is characterized by a nonpitting edema affecting the dorsal side of fingers and hands with puffy aspect frequency and severity of the complications of this syndrome are rarely reported local infectious complications such as cellulitis can be severe and can enable the diagnosis herein we report the case of a 41 year old man who went to the emergency department for abdominal pain fever and bullous lesions of legs and arms with edema bacteriologic examination of a closed bullous lesion evidenced a methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus the abdomen computed tomography excluded deep infections and peritoneal effusion the patient was successfully treated by intravenous oxacillin and clindamycin he had a previous history of intravenous heroin addiction we retained the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome revealed by a severe staphylococcal infection with toxic involvement mimicking a four limbs cellulitis puffy hand syndrome apart from the chronic lymphedema treatment has no specific medication available prophylactic measures against skin infections are essential.

5318929fb166e2b80600001b	What is the Her2 status in Li-Fraumeni syndrome?	Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in HER2+ breast cancer patients Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %). As seen in this case, most breast cancers in patients with LFS exhibit a triple-positive phenotype (estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/HER2-positive).  Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.

5e46eb7a3f5415952900000d	Which disease is rated using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale?	The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) clinical tremor rating scale was used to score tremor, drawing, and drinking before and after each GKT.  The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. During each study visit, the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the Quality of Life for Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) were administered along with kinematic assessment of the treated limb.  Further, this same network was associated with clinical tremor severity measured with the Fahn, Tolosa, Marin Tremor Rating Scale, suggesting this network is clinically relevant. Results: Postsurgery mean scores for the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Scale were improved from 78 to 44 in SCA patients and from 54 to 21 in ET patients. Secondary objectives include tremor reduction (obtained by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale, video recordings, the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, and by tremor analysis), psychiatric assessment of patients, and to assess the safety of intervention. All the enrolled patients were evaluated before the treatment and 2 days after, with a clinical control of the treatment effectiveness using the graphic items of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale.  Thirty-four ET patients were consecutively enrolled in the experiments and assessed along one year. Arm tremor was videofilmed and scored using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS). Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale was used for tremor evaluation. Tremor and cerebellar signs were scored according to the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin and the SARA scale. Tremor severity on acute stimulation was assessed by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Cerebellar impairment was evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale.  The treatment efficacy was evaluated by the Fahn Tolosa Marin tremor rating score and NIH genetic criteria for tremor severity at 4 and 8 weeks after each of the two sets of treatments.

Consecutive assignment was made to either case or control group based on their chest radiograph having shown coal workers' pneumoconiosis or no coal workers' pneumoconiosis. It has recently been suggested that the inhalation of coal in the absence of complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) or smoking can lead to disabling airways obstruction Highlights in the history of efforts to prevent occupational lung disease among coal miners in the United States are reviewed. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 is summarized, and the sources and effects of its provisions to prevent coal workers' pneumoconiosis are examined. Descriptions follow of the identification of coal workers' pneumoconiosis as a disease, identification of respirable coal mine dust as its cause, and establishment and enforcement of an exposure limit Coal workers' pneumoconiosis is a preventable occupational disorder of the respiratory system resulting from exposure to and retention of respirable coal dust.

55058af6f73303d458000004	Which protein is the E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets the tumor suppressor p53 for proteasomal degradation?	p53 levels and activity are controlled in large part through regulated ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the 26S proteasome. Monoubiquitination of p53 is mediated primarily by the RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and impacts p53 activity through modulation of p53 localization and transcription activities.  The RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is the master regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. It targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, restraining the potent activity of p53 and enabling cell survival and proliferation. The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor is regulated primarily by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 to target it for proteasomal degradation. Aside from its ubiquitin ligase function, Mdm2 has been believed to be capable of suppressing p53's transcriptional activity by binding with and masking the transactivation domain of p53. The regulation of p53 expression levels is critical in controlling p53 activity in normal and damaged cells. This is well illustrated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation under normal conditions and is essential for controlling p53 activity during development. p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. Mdm2 has been thought to regulate the tumor suppressor p53 in two ways: by masking p53's access to transcriptional machinery, and by ubiquitinating p53, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This dogma was recently challenged by data generated from knockin mice in which Mdm2's RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was abrogated by a single point mutation. The RING mutant Mdm2 is fully capable of binding with p53, yet cannot suppress p53 activity, suggesting that Mdm2 cannot block p53 by binding alone, without ubiquitination. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the proteasomal degradation and activity of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma and the transcription factor E2F1.  The p53 tumor suppressor protein has a major role in protecting genome integrity. Under normal circumstances Mdmx and Mdm2 control the activity of p53. Both proteins inhibit the transcriptional regulation by p53, while Mdm2 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target both p53 and Mdmx for proteasomal degradation.  p53 is a critical coordinator of a wide range of stress responses. To facilitate a rapid response to stress, p53 is produced constitutively but is negatively regulated by MDM2. MDM2 can inhibit p53 in multiple independent ways: by binding to its transcription activation domain, inhibiting p53 acetylation, promoting nuclear export, and probably most importantly by promoting proteasomal degradation of p53. The latter is achieved via MDM2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity harbored within the MDM2 RING finger domain. Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Acetylation of p53 regulates p53's transcriptional activity and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. Recent studies have shown, however, that the ring-finger domain (RFD) of MDM2, where the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity resides, is necessary but not sufficient for p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that an additional activity of MDM2 might be required. The Mdm2 proto-oncogene is amplified and over-expressed in a variety of tumors. One of the major functions of Mdm2 described to date is its ability to modulate the levels and activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 binds to the N-terminus of p53 and, through its action as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets p53 for rapid proteasomal degradation.  The HDM2-p53 loop is crucial for monitoring p53 level and human pathologies. Therefore, identification of novel molecules involved in this regulatory loop is necessary for understanding the dynamic regulation of p53 and treatment of human diseases. Here, we characterized that the ribosomal protein L6 binds to and suppresses the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2, and subsequently attenuates HDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation.  Together, our study identifies the crucial function of RPL6 in regulating HDM2-p53 pathway, which highlights the importance of RPL6 in human genetic diseases and cancers. Targeting the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 can lead to a therapeutic surge in p53 levels. However, the efficacy of HDM2 inhibition can be compromised by overexpression of HDMX, an HDM2 homolog that binds and sequesters p53. The p53 tumour suppressor protein is tightly controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), but maintains MDM2 expression as part of a negative feedback loop.  Murine double minute (MDM2) is an E3 ligase that promotes ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53). This is well illustrated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation under normal conditions and is essential for controlling p53 activity during development. Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the proteasomal degradation and activity of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma and the transcription factor E2F1 The p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor is regulated primarily by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which ubiquitinates p53 to target it for proteasomal degradation	['The mouse double minute 2 (mdm2)', 'The human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2)']
56e2acfe51531f7e33000014	During which stage of the cell cycle is cohesin deposited on the yeast genome?	In the budding yeast, cohesin is loaded onto the chromosome during the late G1 phase, establishes sister chromatid cohesion concomitant with DNA replication, and dissociates by the telophase.  Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but the process of cohesion establishment during S-phase is still enigmatic. Instead, we find that cohesin stability increases at the time of S-phase in a reaction that can be uncoupled from DNA replication. By using "single-copy" derivatives of the 2-microm plasmid, we demonstrate that recruitment of cohesin at STB during S phase indeed translates into cohesion between plasmid molecules. In cells recovering from nocodazole-induced spindle depolymerization and G(2)/M arrest, cohesin-STB association can be established coincident with spindle restoration. This postreplication recruitment of cohesin is not functional in equipartitioning.  We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP chip) to produce a genome-wide description of cohesin binding to meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cohesin sites are highly conserved in meiosis and mitosis, suggesting that chromosomes share a common underlying structure during different developmental programs. Cohesin complex acts in the formation and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during and after S phase.  Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Sccl subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin. Four of these proteins, Scc1p, Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p, are subunits of a 'Cohesin' complex that binds chromosomes from late G1 until the onset of anaphase. It is necessary for the establishment of cohesion during DNA replication but not for its maintenance during G2 and M phases. Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats. In this review, we have discussed the life cycle of cohesin during both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions including the structure and architecture of cohesin complex, relevance of cohesin associated proteins, mechanism of cohesin loading onto the chromatin, cohesion establishment and the mechanism of cohesin disassembly during anaphase to separate the sister chromatids. Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, suggesting that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding. Cdc14 phosphatase induces rDNA condensation and resolves cohesin-independent cohesion during budding yeast anaphase. Cohesins are deposited by a conserved heterodimeric loading complex composed of the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but how the Scc2/Scc4 deposition complex regulates the spatiotemporal association of cohesin with chromosomes is not understood. We examined Scc2 chromatin association during the cell division cycle and found that the affinity of Scc2 for chromatin increases biphasically during the cell cycle, increasing first transiently in late G1 phase and then again later in G2/M.

589a246078275d0c4a00002a	Which drug was tested in the TEMSO Trial for multiple sclerosis?	Long-term safety and efficacy of teriflunomide: Nine-year follow-up of the randomized TEMSO study. OBJECTIVE: To report safety and efficacy outcomes from up to 9 years of treatment with teriflunomide in an extension (NCT00803049) of the pivotal phase 3 Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial (NCT00134563). CONCLUSIONS: In the TEMSO extension, safety observations were consistent with the core trial, with no new or unexpected AEs in patients receiving teriflunomide for up to 9 years. Teriflunomide, approved on the basis of the two placebo-controlled trials TEMSO and TOWER, demonstrated a reduction in the ARR from 0.54 to 0.37 and from 0.50 to 0.32 respectively.  Using data from pivotal studies of DMF (DEFINE, NCT00420212; CONFIRM, NCT00451451), fingolimod (FREEDOMS, NCT00289978; FREEDOMS II, NCT00355134), and teriflunomide (TEMSO, NCT00134563; TOWER, NCT00751881), we calculated NNTs to prevent any relapse, more severe relapses (such as those leading to hospitalization or requiring intravenous corticosteroids), and disability worsening. METHODS: In September 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the use of teriflunomide, 14 mg and 7 mg once daily, to treat RMS on the basis of the results of a Phase II study and the Phase III TEMSO (Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral) trial.  In the TEMSO and TOWER studies, the 14-mg dose of teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (31% and 36% relative risk reduction compared with placebo, respectively; both P<0.001) and risk of disability progression sustained for 12 weeks (hazard ratio vs placebo 0.70 and 0.69, respectively; both P<0.05). Teriflunomide treatment was also associated with significant efficacy on MRI measures of disease activity in TEMSO; both doses significantly reduced total lesion volume and number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions.

5d386ed6a1e1595105000004	Which part of the TNFR2 gene is genetically associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?	A TNFR2 3' flanking region polymorphism in systemic lupus erythematosus. We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and geographically matched controls.  In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population. Further population and functional studies will be of particular importance to establish TNFR2 as one of the susceptibility genes to SLE. Thus, among the non-synonymous cSNPs, only nt587 (T-->G) (M196R) was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Japanese. No transmission distortion was observed for TNFR2-196R allele.

58cd7fed02b8c6095300003f	What is the function of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)?	The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis.  The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) plays a pivotal role in systemic calcium metabolism by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion and urinary calcium excretion. The CaSR is ubiquitously expressed, implying a wide range of functions regulated by this receptor. The CaSR is a key regulator for such diverse processes as hormone secretion, gene expression, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Due to this pleiotropy, the CaSR is able to regulate cell fate and is implicated in the development of many types of benign or malignant tumours of the breast, prostate, parathyroid, and colon. Extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and ovarian cancer gene receptor 1 (OGR1) are two GPCRs that sense extracellular Ca(2+) and H(+), respectively.   The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) plays a key role in maintaining calcium homeostasis	['The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis.']
514a0a57d24251bc05000051	Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?	Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is widely used as an antidote in comatose patients suspected of having ingested a benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of sedation from benzodiazepines administered during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and during induction or maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for benzodiazepine overdose. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. A 54-y-old man ingested 2 g of bulk laboratory diazepam and was treated with activated charcoal, enhanced diuresis and flumazenil infusion. Flumazenil is a specific and competitive antagonist at the central benzodiazepine receptor, reversing all effects of benzodiazepine agonists without tranquillising or anticonvulsant actions. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic conscious sedation has not been defined. To develop clinical rules for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Flumazenil is best left for reversal of therapeutic conscious sedation and rare select cases of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. It improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17 patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and 58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful in reversing the sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants. The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). The efficacy and safety of flumazenil were assessed in comparison to placebo in a double-blind randomised study of 31 adults intoxicated with benzodiazepines. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation, and orientation in time and space. Patients who received flumazenil awoke within minutes but central depression returned partly one hour later, which reflects the short elimination half-life of the drug. Side effects were few and the results indicate that flumazenil is effective in the primary management of benzodiazepine overdose and in states where benzodiazepines have been taken with other drugs. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of unknown origin.	['flumazenil']
5fe3131ca43ad31278000048	What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?	Many yeast promoter and terminator regions intrinsically disfavor nucleosome formation, and nucleosomes assembled in vitro show strong rotational positioning. Sequence analysis of 284,091 putative nucleosome cores obtained in this manner from a mixed-stage population of C. elegans reveals a combined picture of flexibility and constraint in nucleosome positioning Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. his strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. e argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. This paper rigorously quantifies the contribution of hitherto-debated sequence features-including G+C content, 10.5 bp periodicity, and poly(dA:dT) tracts-to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. We further show that the 10.5 bp nucleotide periodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence.

5148691bd24251bc0500002d	Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation?	Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation. Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase. These results suggest that JNK activation by H(2)O(2) plus PDTC resulted from the down-regulation of JNK phosphatases. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6 phosphatase. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. . We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1.	['JNK']
6081b64d4e6a4cf63000000a	What is the function of the HSJ1 proteins?	HSJ1 (DNAJB2), a member of the DNAJ family of molecular chaperones, is a key player in neuronal proteostasis maintenance. HSJ1 is a neuronal enriched member of the HSP40/DNAJ co-chaperone family. Previous studies have shown that HSP40 proteins play a crucial role in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in several neuronal types, in animal models and human diseases. Homo sapiens J domain protein (HSJ1) is a J-domain containing co-chaperone that is known to stimulate ATPase activity of HSP70 chaperone, while it also harbors two ubiquitin (Ub)-interacting motifs (UIMs) that may bind with ubiquitinated substrates and potentially function in protein degradation.

5d35dfbdb3a638076300000b	What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?	STAG2 and Rad21 mammalian mitotic cohesins are implicated in meiosis.  Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1 and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. Identification of STAG1 as a key mediator of a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. The STAG1 gene was one of the transcripts showing higher expression levels in cells infected with Ad-p53-121F as opposed to Ad-wtp53.  the expression of STAG1 mRNA was induced in response to various genotoxic stresses in a p53-dependent manner; moreover, enforced expression of STAG1 led to apoptosis in several additional cancer cell lines. Differential regulation of telomere and centromere cohesion by the Scc3 homologues SA1 and SA2, respectively, in human cells. Here, we show that cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) are differentially required for telomere and centromere cohesion, respectively. These results suggest that at telomeres cohesion relies on the molecular interplay between TRF1 and SA1 to promote DNA-DNA pairing, while along chromosomal arms the core cohesin assembly might also depend on SA1 1D diffusion on DNA and sequence-specific DNA binding.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer cells on its paralog STAG1 In all cases, we observed that the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.  cohesin-SA1 preferentially contributes to the stabilization of topologically associating domain boundaries together with CTCF, whereas cohesin-SA2 promotes cell-type-specific contacts between enhancers and promoters independently of CTCF. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association. A striking finding was the identification of members of the cohesin complex (STAG2, RAD21, STAG1, and SMC3) among the top 20 genes from the screen. Upon individual validation of these cohesin genes, we found that their knockdown led to an immediate expansion of cells with an HSC phenotype in vitro.	['meiosis and cell proliferation']
52bf1b0a03868f1b06000009	What is the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease?	The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain.  The inheritance is autosomal recessive.  Wilson's disease (WD), or hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive inheritance disorder of copper metabolism caused by ATP7B gene mutation.  Inheritance seems most likely to be autosomal recessive When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20.  Inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause such copper accumulation in WD; reducing the dietary intake of copper cannot prevent the development of WD.  Wilson's disease is a treatable movement disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance which is associated with severe morbidity and mortality if not treated early.  The patient was considered heterozygote for hemochromatosis on the basis of the autosomal recessive inheritance for hemochromatosis, the frequency of the hemochromatosis gene, and the laboratory parameters defining her iron overload.  Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation leading to liver and/or brain damage.  Autosomal recessive inheritance indicates that siblings of affected patients are at 25% risk of having the disease.  Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with autosomal recessive inheritance. Recessive inheritance is, however, supported.  The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance strongly suggests that mutation of a single gene causes the impairment of both caeruloplasmin synthesis and biliary copper excretion. This is consistent with the autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance The overall sex ratio of patients was nearly 1:1, and genetic analysis of 20 families confirmed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.  Dermatoglyphics of 11 patients with Wilson's disease and 16 of their clinically asymptomatic relatives of first degree were investigated; 11 of the latter ones were heterozygous in agreement with the turn over rates of Cu-67, 12 under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance.

The lymphocytes, transformed lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient were demonstrated to have severe beta-D-galactosidase deficiency Only 1 individual was found to have about 50% of normal beta-galactosidase activity; presumably he is a carrier for beta-galactosidase deficiency (GM1 gangliosidosis). GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene, leading to the deficiency of the enzyme β-d-galactosidase GM1 gangliosidosis is a genetic disease with lysosomal beta-galactosidase deficiency caused by mutations of the gene coding for this enzyme GM1 gangliosidosis is a glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage disease caused by a genetic deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), the enzyme that catabolyzes GM1 within lysosomes Correction of acid beta-galactosidase deficiency in GM1 gangliosidosis human fibroblasts by retrovirus vector-mediated gene transfer: higher efficiency of release and cross-correction by the murine enzyme Review of the data is presented on the hereditary disease gangliosidosis GM1 and on the enzyme beta-galactosidose, deficiency of which is responsible for this disease GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease are distinct disorders both clinically and biochemically yet they arise from the same beta-galactosidase enzyme deficiency Heterogeneous patterns of biosynthesis, posttranslational processing, and degradation were demonstrated for mutant enzymes in three clinical forms of beta-galactosidase deficiency (beta-galactosidosis): juvenile GM1-gangliosidosis, adult GM1-gangliosidosis, and Morquio B disease. GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease are distinct disorders both clinically and biochemically yet they arise from the same beta-galactosidase enzyme deficiency. Cerebral lipids of patients with GM1-gangliosidoses, infantile, juvenile, and chronic type which are caused by deficiency of beta-galactosidase, were examined and compared to each other. In the autosomal recessive disease GM1-gangliosidosis caused by a beta-gal deficiency and in galactosialidosis, associated with a combined deficiency of lysosomal neuraminidase and beta-gal, precursor forms of the latter enzyme are found in RER, Golgi and some labeling is present at the cell surface. The lysosomes remain unlabeled, indicative for the absence of enzyme molecules in this organelle. In the lysosomes virtually all beta-gal exists as a high molecular weight multimer of mature enzyme.

5ace12be0340b9f058000007	Which gene is responsible for proper speech development?	The Key Regulator for Language and Speech Development, FOXP2, is a Novel Substrate for SUMOylation. Transcription factor forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) plays an essential role in the development of language and speech. Absence of a paternally inherited FOXP2 gene in developmental verbal dyspraxia. Mutations in FOXP2 cause developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), but only a few cases have been described. Our results indicate that absence of paternal FOXP2 is the cause of DVD in patients with SRS with maternal UPD7. The data also point to a role for differential parent-of-origin expression of FOXP2 in human speech development. Despite similarities in motor planning and execution between speech development and oral feeding competence, there have been no reports to date linking deletions within the FOXP2 gene to oral feeding impairments in the newborn. The gene responsible for the phenotype was mapped to chromosome 7q31 and identified as the FOXP2 gene, coding for a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. The FOXP2 gene is important for the development of proper speech motor control in humans. BACKGROUND Mutations in the human FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal novel regulatory functions of the human FOXP2 3' UTR sequence and regulatory interactions between multiple miRNAs and the human FOXP2 gene. The expression of let-7a, miR-9, and miR-129-5p in the human fetal cerebellum is consistent with their roles in regulating FOXP2 expression during early cerebellum development. CNTNAP2 is known to be involved in the cause of language and speech disorders and autism spectrum disorder and is in the same pathway as FOXP2, another important language gene, which makes it a candidate gene for causal studies speech and language disorders such as stuttering. An adequate amount of functional FOXP2 protein is thought to be critical for the proper development of the neural circuitry underlying speech and language.	['FOXP2']
58a2c77a60087bc10a000002	What is the role of gamma-secreatase complex in Alzheimer's Disease?	gamma-Secretase is critically involved in the Notch pathway and in Alzheimer's disease.  Presenilins are the catalytic subunit of the large gamma-secretase complex, that promotes intramembranous proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the production of beta-amyloid (A beta). Mutant presenilin causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), is related to abnormal Ca(2+) signaling, and render cells vulnerable to cell death.  Presenilins form the catalytic part of the gamma-secretases, protein complexes that are responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of transmembrane proteins. The presenilins are involved in several biological functions, but are best known for their role in the generation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and are therefore thought to be important drug targets for this disorder. Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) generated by proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, in that it cleaves a precursor to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients. Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer. The GxxxG motif in the transmembrane domain of AbetaPP plays an essential role in the interaction of CTF beta with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of amyloid-beta. Gamma-secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a crucial step in the formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), but little is known about how the substrate AbetaPP interacts with the gamma-secretase complex.  Thus, the present study revealed an essential role for the GxxxG motif in the interaction of AbetaPP with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of Abeta. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of hypoxia in modulating the APP processing by facilitating both beta- and gamma-cleavage which may result in a significant increase of Abeta generation. The gamma-secretase, composed of presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH-1), and PEN-2, is critical for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  APP is a ubiquitous membrane protein that is physiologically processed by site-specific proteolysis firstly by alpha- or beta-secretases, releasing a large fragment called APP(S) that contains most of the extracellular sequences of APP, a small extracellular stub, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail of APP (;AICD'-APP intracellular domain). These are subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase at multiple sites in the transmembrane region, releasing small peptides, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the major components of AD-associated amyloid fibrils.  As PS1 has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating gamma-secretase activity, and mutations in this protein are associated with familial AD (FAD), we have cloned it from SAMP8 mouse hippocampus and compared its sequence with those of other species. An increased amount or mutation(s) in PS1, which alters the stoichiometric balance of the gamma-secretase complex, may be the cause of aberrant or increased processing of APP, resulting in Abeta accumulation leading to loss of memory. The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression.  The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. Suppressor Mutations for Presenilin 1 Familial Alzheimer Disease Mutants Modulate γ-Secretase Activities Synthesis and SAR Studies of Fused Oxadiazines as γ-Secretase Modulators for Treatment of Alzheimers Disease Pathological activity of familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutant presenilin can be executed by six different gamma-secretase complexes. The reconstituted enzyme processes C99 and the Notch-like substrate N160 and displays the characteristic features of gamma-secretase in terms of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, upregulation of Abeta42 production by a familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation in the APP gene, and downregulation of Notch processing by PS1 FAD mutations.  The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Genetic analysis of familial Alzheimer's disease has revealed that mutations in the gamma-secretase enzyme presenilin promote toxic Abeta secretion; however, presenilin mutations might also influence tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration through gamma-secretase-independent mechanisms.  Here, we show that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations clustered near the sites of gamma-secretase cleavage actually decrease gamma-secretase-mediated release of the intracellular fragment of APP (CTFgamma).  Beside the well investigated role of presenilins as the catalytic unit in γ-secretase complex, their involvement in regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis has recently come into more focus of Alzheimer's disease research. The γ-secretase complex is a promising target in Alzheimer's disease because of its role in the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein. Genetic studies of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease cases revealed causative mutations in the genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein and the γ-secretase-complex components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, supporting an important role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Assembly, maturation, and trafficking of the gamma-secretase complex in Alzheimer's disease. Gamma-secretase was first recognized because of its role in the production of Abeta peptides that are pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of gamma-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease. Drugs that regulate the production of Abeta by inhibiting or modulating gamma-secretase activity could provide a disease-modifying effect on Alzheimer's disease, although recent studies suggest that gamma-secretase plays important roles in cellular signaling including Notch. The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease.. The gamma-secretase complex is therefore believed to be critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. gamma-Secretase heterogeneity in the Aph1 subunit: relevance for Alzheimer's disease.

5a895f51fcd1d6a10c000004	What is the preferred orientation of CTCF binding sites for chromatin looping?	Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated Conversely, CTCF binding sites in NPCs are largely preexisting in pluripotent stem cells. Only a small number of CTCF sites arise de novo in NPCs.  Moreover, siRNA knockdown ofYy1specifically disrupts interactions between key NPC enhancers and their target genes. YY1-mediated interactions between NPC regulatory elements are often nested within constitutive loops anchored by CTCF As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another.  As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. ccctc binding factor ctcf is an architectural protein involved in the three dimensional 3d organization of chromatin in this study we assayed the 3d genomic contact profiles of a large number of ctcf binding sites with high resolution 4c seq as recently reported our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between ctcf binding sites oriented in a convergent manner to directly test this we used crispr cas9 genome editing to delete core ctcf binding sites in three loci including the ctcf site in the sox2 super enhancer in all instances ctcf and cohesin recruitment were lost and chromatin loops with distal convergent ctcf sites were disrupted or destabilized re insertion of oppositely oriented ctcf recognition sequences restored ctcf and cohesin recruitment but did not re establish chromatin loops we conclude that ctcf binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. we recently used in situ hi c to create kilobase resolution 3d maps of mammalian genomes here we combine these maps with new hi c microscopy and genome editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers domains and loops we find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer combining hi c data and novel mathematical theorems we show that contact domains are also not consistent with a fractal globule instead we use physical simulations to study two models of genome folding in one intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation leads to formation of an anisotropic tension globule in the other ccctc binding factor ctcf and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation that contact domains tend to form inside loops however the extrusion model explains a far wider array of observations such as why loops tend not to overlap and why the ctcf binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation finally we perform 13 genome editing experiments examining the effect of altering ctcf binding sites on chromatin folding the convergent rule correctly predicts the affected loops in every case moreover the extrusion model accurately predicts in silico the 3d maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of ctcf binding sites in the wt thus we show that it is possible to disrupt restore and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base pair.

54f60ea05f206a0c06000009	Is there any genetic determinant of hair pigmentation that could be useful in forensic analyses?	a recent paper has reported the genetic determination of eye and hair color in samples up to 800 years old.   Here, we demonstrate that human hair color is predictable from DNA variants with similarly high accuracies. 12 genes previously associated with human hair color variation  several key pigmentation genes have been characterised, in particular the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R). Here, the function and known mutations of MC1R and other human pigmentation genes including ASIP, MATP, SLC24A5, TYR, TYRP1 and OCA2 are outlined, and a forensic test based on MC1R SNPs presented. Recent studies have proved that there is a significant association between some genetic variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene and red hair color. We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype.  Interactions between HERC2, OCA2 and MC1R may influence human pigmentation phenotype. Several genome-wide association studies for pigmentation have now been conducted and identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in known, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP, KITLG and previously unknown SLC24A4, IRF4, TPCN2, candidate genes.   five red hair colour (RHC) MC1R alleles,  Naturally blond hair is rare in humans and found almost exclusively in Europe and Oceania. Here, we identify an arginine-to-cysteine change at a highly conserved residue in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) as a major determinant of blond hair in Solomon Islanders.

We present and make available libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching under both the edit and the Hamming distance models. Moreover we describe how fixed-length approximate string matching is applied to solve real problems by incorporating libFLASM into established applications for multiple circular sequence alignment as well as single and structured motif extraction. Specifically, we describe how it can be used to improve the accuracy of multiple circular sequence alignment in terms of the inferred likelihood-based phylogenies; and we also describe how it is used to efficiently find motifs in molecular sequences representing regulatory or functional regions. The comparison of the performance of the library to other algorithms show how it is competitive, especially with increasing distance thresholds. Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of the classic approximate string matching problem.

5ac24c9495d0062724000002	What is the ChIP-exo method used for?	ChIP-exo method for identifying genomic location of DNA-binding proteins with near-single-nucleotide accuracy. ChIP-exo allows identification of a nearly complete set of the binding locations of DNA-binding proteins at near-single-nucleotide resolution with almost no background. Precise Identification of DNA-Binding Proteins Genomic Location by Exonuclease Coupled Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP-exo). A significant improvement of the ChIP-seq technique results from the addition of an exonuclease treatment during the immunoprecipitation step (ChIP-exo) that lowers background noise and more importantly increases the identification of binding sites to a level near to single-base resolution by effectively footprinting DNA-bound proteins.  The ChIP-exo Method: Identifying Protein-DNA Interactions with Near Base Pair Precision. The key distinction of the ChIP-exo methodology is the incorporation of lambda exonuclease digestion in the library preparation workflow to effectively footprint the left and right 5' DNA borders of the protein-DNA crosslink site.

In Vivo Functional Platform Targeting Patient-Derived Xenografts Identifies WDR5-Myc Association as a Critical Determinant of Pancreatic Cancer. We developed an unbiased and in vivo target discovery approach to identify molecular vulnerabilities in low-passage and patient-derived PDAC xenografts or genetically engineered mouse model-derived allografts. Focusing on epigenetic regulators, we identified WDR5, a core member of the COMPASS histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) MLL (1-4) methyltransferase complex, as a top tumor maintenance hit required across multiple human and mouse tumors. Mechanistically, WDR5 functions to sustain proper execution of DNA replication in PDAC cells, as previously suggested by replication stress studies involving MLL1, and c-Myc, also found to interact with WDR5. We indeed demonstrate that interaction with c-Myc is critical for this function. By showing that ATR inhibition mimicked the effects of WDR5 suppression, these data provide rationale to test ATR and WDR5 inhibitors for activity in this disease.	['c-Myc']
51716e808ed59a060a00000b	Which is the vector of Louping ill virus?	Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. n Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. The complex pathogen-host-vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector. We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system. This study has examined the efficacy following intramuscular administration of a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) vaccine, encoding the prME and NS1 proteins of louping ill virus (LIV), in sheep. Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered.

54f89e1a06d9727f76000001	Which kinase is inhibited by the small molecule KN-93?	KN-93, a membrane-permeant calcium/calmodulin- dependent kinase-selective inhibitor, induces apoptosis in some lines of human tumor cells. Knockdown of βCaMKII by lentiviral-mediated expression of shRNA prevented the synaptic inactivity-induced increase in GluA1, as did treatment with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analog KN-92. To investigate the effects of KN-93, a CaMKII selective inhibitor on cell proliferation and the expression of p53 or p21 protein in human hepatic stellate cells.  Injection of the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 into pupae resulted in a reduced number of antennal lobe glial cells migrating into the neuropil to form borders around glomeruli. In contrast, addition of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitor KN93 blocked reporter gene activation in response to IH. These increases in CPEB phosphorylation were attenuated by a specific peptide inhibitor of CaMKII and by the general CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93. Alternatively, treatment with KN-93, a selective inhibitor of CaMKII activation, or adenoviral overexpression of kinase-negative CaMKII-delta(2), inhibited ATP-dependent activation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on PDBu- or PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2. Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KN-93 also blocked zygote elongation, while its ineffective analog KN-92 did not have such effect. CaM kinase inhibitor KN93 on its own exhibits little toxicity up to 10 mM, as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium. To further elucidate the mechanism by which calcium-induced ERK activation occurs, we used the CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93 and an inactive analog of KN-93 (KN-92). Hearts were pretreated with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 or the inactive analog KN-92 (0.5 microM) for 10 min before clofilium exposure. The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) inhibitor KN-93 has been shown to reversibly arrest mouse and human cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide.  A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) inhibitor, KN-93 potently inhibits gastric acid secretion from parietal cells. CaM kinase II activation was inhibited by KN-93 pretreatment (IC(50) approximately 1 microM).

The effects of anifrolumab on type I IFN pathway activation were assessed using signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation, IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase reporter cell assays and type I IFN gene signature induction. Randomization was stratified by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score (<10 or ≥10), oral corticosteroid dosage (<10 or ≥10 mg/day), and type I IFN gene signature test status (high or low) based on a 4-gene expression assay. patients with a high IFN signature at baseline  Patients were stratified by disease activity, interferon gene-signature test (high vs low based on the expression of four genes) and geographical region.  Our group, using microarray analysis, identified the interferon (IFN) gene signature in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has published data that suggest high doses of intravenous corticosteroid treatment may have benefit over strictly oral regimens. In this study, we report the presence of IFN activation in SLE bone marrow (BM), as measured by an IFN gene signature, increased IFN regulated chemokines, and direct production of IFN by BM-resident cells, associated with profound changes in B cell development. Pronounced alterations in B cell development were noted in SLE in the presence of an IFN signature with a reduction in the fraction of pro/pre-B cells, suggesting an inhibition in early B cell development and an expansion of B cells at the transitional stage.  At baseline, patients had moderate-to-severe disease activity (mean SLE Disease Activity Index score 11.0), and most (75.2%) had a high type I interferon (IFN) gene signature.  Inhibition of the type I IFN gene signature was sustained during treatment in patients with a high baseline signature.  Patient baseline body WT, interferon gene signature from 21 genes, steroid use, and sifalimumab dose were identified as significant covariates for CL, whereas only baseline body WT was a significant covariate for V 1 and peripheral volume of distribution (V 2) These include: type I interferon (IFN) gene signature as a pharmacodynamic marker and potential predictive marker for anti-type I IFN therapy; anti-double stranded DNA as a disease marker and potential predictive marker for flares; the complements and neutrophil signatures as disease marker of SLE All SLE B cell populations revealed an interferon (IFN) gene signature previously only reported in unseparated SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements aseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (P < .0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients compared with healthy volunteers.  In addition, platelets with type I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE. During the trial, we also examined whether overexpression of an IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signature in whole blood could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to evaluate IFNalpha neutralization and investigated downstream effects of neutralizing IFNalpha on BAFF and other key signaling pathways, i.e., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and IL-1beta, in SLE IFNalpha/beta-inducible gene signatures in whole blood are effective pharmacodynamic biomarkers to evaluate anti-IFNalpha mAb therapy in SLE SLE is characterized by a type-I interferon gene signature. These observations provide a link between dysregulation of apoptosis and phagocytosis and the type-I interferon signature observed in SLE patients. Of interest, the IFN gene 'signature' correlates with more severe disease.  A role for interferon (IFN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis is inferred from the prominent IFN gene signature (IGS), but the major IFN species and its relationship to disease activity are unknown. Interferon (IFN) signature genes have been shown to be expressed highly in peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in the presence of active disease. OBJECTIVE: The interferon (IFN) signature is related to disease activity and vascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and represents a promising therapeutic target. BACKGROUND: There is increased expression of type I interferon (IFN)-regulated proteins in the blood and target tissues of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Additio INTRODUCTION: A hallmark of systemic autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the increased expression of interferon (IFN) type I inducible genes, so-called IFN type I  Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased expression of type I interferon (IFN)-regulated genes (an IFN signature), which is caused by an ongoing production of type I IFNs by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The  This study investigated serum IL-3 and IFN levels, and a whole blood 'IL-3 gene signature', in human SLE SION: SLE patients demonstrated increased expression of an IFN response gene signature (75% of patients had an elevated IFN response gene signature) at baseline in ILLUMINATE-1 and ILLUMINATE-2. Subs SLE patients exhibit increased IFN signatures in their skin secondary to increased production and a robust, skewed IFN response that is regulated by PITX1.  An earlier study showed that SLE patients carrying an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature in blood have elevated serum levels of IFN-regulated chemokines  The role of type I interferon (IFN) in SLE has been demonstrated from the 2000s, by gene expression analyses showing significant over-expression of genes related to type I IFN signalling pathway (IFN signature) The type I interferon (IFN) gene signature and circulating autoantibodies are hallmarks of SLE. Many SLE patients have increased serum levels of IFN-alpha and display an IFN gene expression "signature" characterized by strong overexpression of IFN-responsive genes in leukocytes and target tissues.  However, several studies questioned the role of measuring the intensity of IFN signature (IFN score) to chase SLE activity A bioinformatic approach employing individual IFN species gene signatures to interrogate SLE microarray datasets demonstrates a putative role for numerous IFN species, with prominent expression of IFNB1 and IFNW signatures. GS test-high patients overexpressed many gene signatures associated with SLE pathogenesis compared with IFNGS test-low patients, reflecting broad immune activation. Th I IFN signature could be a novel marker for vascular disease in SLE. Real-time PCR was used to confirm a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature in patients with SLE, and the IFN-regulated proteins PRKRA, IFITM1 and CD69 (P < .0001) were found to be up-regulated in platelets from SLE patients compared with healthy volunteers. An increased expression of type I IFN-regulated genes, termed IFN signature, has been reported in patients with SLE. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we now show that active SLE can be distinguished by a remarkably homogeneous gene expression pattern with overexpression of granulopoiesis-related and interferon (IFN)-induced genes. OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) and IFNgamma to the IFN gene expression signature that has been observed in microarray screens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of healthy control PBMCs was used to determine the relative induction of a panel of IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) by IF osus (SLE). Patients with SLE have increased IFN-regulated gene expression pointing towards a possible underlying genetic defect.OBJECTIVES: To determine expression levels of five type I IFN-regulated genes that are highly expressed in SLE in the peripheral blood of patients with CLE and to correlate the expression levels with cutaneous disease activity.METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 healthy controls and 30 patients with CLE, incl Up-regulation of a set of 63 IFN signature genes was seen in 83% of SLE patients and 50% of ILE patients.

Exencephaly/anencephaly is a rare neural tube defect occurring early in embryogenesis. Exencephaly is an uncommon malformation of the cranium that characteristically involves a large, disorganized mass of cerebral tissue. Exencephaly is said to precede anencephaly resulting from failure of the rostral neuropore closure. Exencephaly is a rare precursor of anencephaly in which a large amount of brain tissue is present despite the absence of the calvaria.

56c048acef6e39474100001c	Which enzyme is inhibited by Imetelstat?	The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.  Telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L) limits the lifespan of human pancreatic cancer cells. GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase.  We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT.  Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and phosphorylation of TP53. The activity of imetelstat as a single agent suggests that further studies of telomerase inhibitors in combination with other agents may be warranted.  Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of telomerase inhibition on proliferation and tumorigenicity in established cell lines (BXD-1425EPN, R254), a primary TIC line (E520) and xenograft models of pediatric ependymoma.  PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase.  Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Imetelstat inhibited proliferation and self-renewal by shortening telomeres and inducing senescence in vitro. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. The GBM tumor-initiating cells were treated with imetelstat and examined for the effects on telomerase activity levels, telomere length, proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation. We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT. This enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not in the majority of normal somatic cells. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.  Telomerase antagonist imetelstat inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth and increases radiation-induced DNA breaks. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential.  When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells.  Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer.  In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs.  Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.  BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity.  Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis.  Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. 	['telomerase']
530cf4fe960c95ad0c00000b	Which type of lung cancer is afatinib used for?	Afatinib is a novel irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family members EGFR, tyrosine kinase-type cell surface receptors HER2 and HER4. It shows preclinical efficacy in NSCLC with common EGFR-activating mutations and the T790M mutation typically associated with EGFR TKI resistance At present, only first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (erlotinib and gefitinib) are available for clinical use. Second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKIs, such as afatinib, are still in clinical trials. In current clinical practice, EGFR-TKI is the first-line treatment of choice for metastatic NSCLC patients with tumor EGFR mutation or as salvage therapy in NSCLC patients who received systemic chemotherapy previously Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program. These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib BIBW2992 is an irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2 and vascular epidermal growth factor receptors In vitro work shows that this compound inhibits wild-type EGFR, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, and EGFR T790M, the mutation associated with acquired resistance Here, we show that BIBW2992, an anilino-quinazoline designed to irreversibly bind EGFR and HER2, potently suppresses the kinase activity of wild-type and activated EGFR and HER2 mutants, including erlotinib-resistant isoforms Afatinib versus placebo for patients with advanced, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of erlotinib, gefitinib, or both, and one or two lines of chemotherapy (LUX-Lung 1): a phase 2b/3 randomised trial.

5fe08b77a43ad31278000032	Which gene is primarily associated with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome?	Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed prenatally. It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene. We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. Mutations of the TWIST gene in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalo-syndactyly type III, ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis with brachydactyly, soft tissue syndactyly and facial dysmorphism including ptosis, facial asymmetry and prominent ear crura. ACS III has been mapped to chromosome 7p21-22. Of interest, TWIST, the human counterpart of the murine Twist gene, has been localized on chromosome 7p21 as well.  Of the 37 patients with classic features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, the overall detection rate for TWIST mutations was 68%.  Increased risk for developmental delay in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated with TWIST deletions: an improved strategy for TWIST mutation screening. Mutations within or upstream of the basic helix-loop-helix domain of the TWIST gene are specific to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome recently ascribed to mutations in the TWIST gene, a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor regulating head mesenchyme cell development during cranial neural tube formation in mouse.  Finally, since no TWIST mutations were detected in 40 cases of isolated coronal craniosynostosis, the present study suggests that TWIST mutations are specific to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Mutations in the basic domain and the loop-helix II junction of TWIST abolish DNA binding in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal dominant skull disorder resulting from premature fusion of coronal sutures (craniosynostosis). It is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene encoding a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor. Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.  Notably, multiple Twist1 mutations associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome alter protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Twist1, suggesting that misregulation of Twist1 dimerization through either stoichiometric or post-translational mechanisms underlies phenotypes of individuals with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by TWIST 1 gene mutations The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome with uni- or bilateral coronal synostosis and mild limb deformities. It is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST 1 gene.  The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), one of the most common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures), results from haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, caused by deletions of the entire gene or loss-of-function variants within the coding region.  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostotic disorder characterized by coronal synostosis, facial asymmetry, ptosis, and limb abnormalities. Haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is responsible for SCS.  The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TWIST1. The majority of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have mutations in the TWIST gene, which codes for a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7p21. The chromosome rearrangement downstream of TWIST is compatible with the notion that this is a Saethre-Chotzen syndrome gene and implies loss of function of one allele by a positional effect as a possible mechanism of mutation to evoke the syndrome. The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, which is defined by loss-of-function mutations in the TWIST gene, is the second most prevalent craniosynostosis. The TWIST gene codes for a transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) motif and has recently been described as a candidate gene for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, based on the detection of mutations within the coding region. Altered Twist1 and Hand2 dimerization is associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and limb abnormalities. Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.  this region, the TWIST1 gene encoding a transcription factor was considered as a strong candidate gene since its haploinsufficiency is responsible for the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, characterized by skull coronal suture synostosis. Sequencin loinsufficiency of the human TWIST1 gene, which causes the craniosynostosis disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), is related to failure to repress transcription of CDKN1A (which encodes p21/WAF1/CIP1), promoting osteoblast differentiation. We have e  such gene that has been implicated in both syndromic (Saethre-Chotzen syndrome) and nonsyndromic forms of CS in humans is TWIST1. In thi Twist1 is the mouse ortholog of TWIST1, the human gene mutated in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. P rigenesis. Some loss-of-function mutations of the TWIST1 gene have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis, known as the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome TWIST1 gene, detected by Multiplex Ligation Probe-dependent Amplification (MPLA) and array-CGH, was consistent with phenotype of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Array CGH also showe eletion of 500 kb included the TWIST1 gene, a suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with RSTS. A similar issue of d Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), one of the most common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures), results from haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, caused by deletions of the entire gene or loss-of-function variants within the coding region. To det Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is associated with haploinsufficiency of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor TWIST1 and is characterized by premature closure of the cranial sutures, termed craniosynostosis; however, the mechanisms underlying this defect are unclear. Twist Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome recently ascribed to mutations in the TWIST gene, a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor regulating head mesenchyme cell development during cranial neural tube formation in mouse. Contiguous gene deletion neighboring TWIST1 identified in a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome associated with neurodevelopmental delay: Possible contribution of HDAC9. Prenatal diagnosis of craniosynostosis (compound Saethre-Chotzen syndrome phenotype) caused by a de novo complex chromosomal rearrangement (1; 4; 7) with a microdeletion of 7p21.3-7p15.3, including TWIST1 gene--a case report. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), associated with TWIST-1 mutations, is characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the Twist gene replicate certain features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, but have not been reported to exhibit craniosynostosis. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome whose gene has been assigned to chromosome 7p (TWIST). Comprehensive studies in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have demonstrated a TWIST gene abnormality in about 80%, up to 37% of which may be large deletions [Johnson et al., 1998]. The authors conclude that when using stringent inclusion criteria for studies of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, patients who have a pathogenic mutation of the TWIST gene should be excluded. This case report describes a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome caused by a mutation in the TWIST gene who exhibits a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Our results also indicate that the TWIST1 gene may be a novel breast cancer susceptibility gene. Additional studies are, however, necessary to reveal the mechanism by which TWIST1 may predispose to early onset breast cancer in Saethre-Chotzen patients. However, recent studies, using a murine breast tumor model, have shown that Twist may act as a key regulator of metastasis and that the gene is overexpressed in subsets of sporadic human breast cancers. BACKGROUND: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chro Mutations in the TWIST gene have been identified in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Of the patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation, three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the entire TWIST gene. Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%) with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or TWIST. The TWIST gene, although not disrupted in Saethre-Chotzen patients with apparently balanced translocations of 7p21, is mutated in familial and sporadic cases.

5e52be146d0a27794100004a	Which type of distance is used in the R-package XenofilteR?	XenofilteR: computational deconvolution of mouse and human reads in tumor xenograft sequence data. Mouse xenografts from (patient-derived) tumors (PDX) or tumor cell lines are widely used as models to study various biological and preclinical aspects of cancer. However, analyses of their RNA and DNA profiles are challenging, because they comprise reads not only from the grafted human cancer but also from the murine host. The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary.RESULTS: We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome. To assess the accuracy of XenofilteR, we generated sequence data by in silico mixing of mouse and human DNA sequence data. These analyses revealed that XenofilteR removes > 99.9% of sequence reads of mouse origin while retaining human sequences. This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.CONCLUSIONS: XenofilteR accurately dissects RNA and DNA sequences from mouse and human origin, thereby outperforming currently available tools.

56c1f01aef6e394741000043	What is targeted by monoclonal antibody Pembrolizumab?	gents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A).  Ipilimumab (CTLA-4) and pembrolizumab (PD-1) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma, and additional regulatory approvals are expected across the oncologic spectrum for a variety of other agents that target these pathways. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.  METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.  The anti programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been recently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  We describe for the first time the case of an adult patient who developed autoimmune diabetes likely as a consequence of PD-1 inhibition with pembrolizumab.  Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody and pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death 1 receptor may be a feasible treatment option in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma Pembrolizumab, a humanized highly selective IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on promising early-phase clinical data Anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 treatment with pembrolizumab in ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma: a randomised dose-comparison cohort of a phase 1 trial. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%).CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.  BACKGROUND: The anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has shown potent antitumour activity at different doses and schedules in patients with melanoma. We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma.METHODS: In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged ?18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.  Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are targeted agents for patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody and pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death 1 receptor may be a feasible treatment option in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma. Pembrolizumab, a humanized highly selective IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on promising early-phase clinical data.

Transgenesis of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can enable and empower a variety of studies in stem cell research, including lineage tracing and functional genetics studies. While in recent years much progress has been made in the development of tools for gene targeting, little attention has been given to the identification of sites in the human genome where transgenes can be inserted and reliably expressed. In order to find human genomic sites capable of supporting long-term and high-level transgene expression in hPSCs, we performed a lentiviral screen in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We isolated 40 iPSC clones each harboring a single vector copy and characterized the level of transgene expression afforded by each unique integration site. We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The LiPS-A3 line can greatly facilitate the insertion of reporter and other genes in hPSCs. Targeting transgenes in the LiPS-A3S genomic locus can find broad applications in stem cell research and possibly cell and gene therapy.

58a2e5f760087bc10a000007	Which is the primary protein component of Lewy bodies?	Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn), the primary protein component in Lewy body inclusions of patients with Parkinson's disease, arises when the normally soluble intrinsically disordered protein converts to amyloid fibrils.  The primary structural component of Lewy bodies are fibrils composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, a highly conserved 140 amino acid protein that is predominantly expressed in neurons and which may play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Fibrillar α-synuclein (AS) is the major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.  Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's Disease.  For alpha-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson's disease, we have used a combination of ssNMR and biochemical data to identify the key region for self-aggregation of the protein as residues 77-82 (VAQKTV).  The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.  Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Alpha-synuclein forms the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the defining neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. á-Synuclein is the major protein component of Lewy bodies--the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). alpha-Synuclein and ubiquitin are two Lewy body protein components that may play antagonistic roles in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies. The segregation of alpha-synuclein to Lewy body peripheral domain is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein is continually deposited onto Lewy bodies. Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p Whereas approximately 550 proteins were identified in the LB-enriched sample by mass spectrometry, quantitative comparison with the control sample revealed that approximately 40 proteins were co-enriched with alpha-synuclein, the major component in Lewy bodies This apparent conflict in protein levels might have arisen from examining Lewy body disease cases with coexisting Alzheimer-type pathologies.To assess whether ATP13A2 levels in Lewy body disease are modified by Alzheimer-type β-amyloid deposition, we evaluated cases of pure PD and pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for changes in ATP13A2, α-synuclein and β-amyloid protein levels in cortical regions with and without Lewy bodies.In all Lewy body disease cases, we identified decreased ATP13A2 protein levels that correlated with increases in both α-synuclein and β-amyloid Partial colocalization was observed between ATP13A2 and α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, whereas ATP13A2 did not colocalize with pathological β-amyloid deposition.Our data show that patients with Lewy body diseases have an overall deficit in ATP13A2 protein levels, with the remaining protein being more insoluble and partially redistributing towards Lewy bodies Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p. Human α-synuclein is a small-sized, natively unfolded protein that in fibrillar form is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. α-Synuclein is a small synaptic protein that has been linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also the primary component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark neuropathology found in the brain of sporadic and familial PD patients. The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. α-Synuclein is an abundant presynaptic protein and a primary component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease. The natively disordered protein alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the cellular hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is the principal protein component of Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Lewy bodies and coarse Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Lewy bodies and coarse Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. This study demonstrates for the first time that extensive and thin alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions are present in the axonal processes of neurons. á-Synuclein is the major protein component of Lewy bodies--the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Its accumulation into intracellular aggregates is implicated in the process of Lewy body formation. Filamentous alpha-synuclein inclusions link multiple system atrophy with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component. Microtubule-associated protein 1B is a component of cortical Lewy bodies and binds alpha-synuclein filaments. These findings indicate that alpha-synuclein forms the major filamentous component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.. The protein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy bodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD.

5e36cf8eb5b409ea53000007	Which type of cells protect Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates?	Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require a specific microenvironment, the haematopoietic niche, which regulates HSPC behaviour1,2. The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression. The umbrella of melanocytes associated with the haematopoietic niche is highly evolutionarily conserved in aquatic animals, including the sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate. During the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, HSPCs relocated into the bone marrow, which is protected from ultraviolet light by the cortical bone around the marrow. Our studies reveal that melanocytes above the haematopoietic niche protect HSPCs from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates and suggest that during the transition to terrestrial life, ultraviolet light was an evolutionary pressure affecting the location of the haematopoietic niche.

58917c88621ea6ff7e00000a	Where can you find the annulus of Zinn?	Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The annular tendon is commonly named 'annulus of Zinn', from the German anatomist and botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759) who described this structure in his Descriptio anatomica oculi humani (Anatomical Description of the Human Eye, 1755). It arose at the annulus of Zinn, passing forwards between the inferior rectus muscle and lateral rectus muscle, and insert directly on the sclera.  Drilling was continued toward the annulus of Zinn (AZ) and optic nerve superiorly and over the intracavernous ICA posteriorly. Measurements before and after resection of the ACP included the length of C6 segment of the ICA on its lateral aspect; C6 segment length on its medial aspect; and medial length of the optic nerve from the optic chiasm to falciform ligament (before ACP resection) then to the annulus of Zinn (after ACP resection). The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle.   In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1.5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles.  The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. PURPOSE: To describe a combined transcranial-orbital approach for en bloc resection of optic nerve gliomas with preservation of the annulus of Zinn that minimizes recurrence and prevents postoperative paralytic ptosis.DESIGN: A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.STUDY POPULATION: All patients who underwent optic nerve glioma resections using this technique with the authors between 1994 and 2010.PROCEDURE: A transcranial-orbital approach is used to resect the intracranial segment of the optic nerve glioma from 2 mm anterior to the chiasm to the posterior extent of annulus of Zinn. No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis.CONCLUSIONS: The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis.

The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm. The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes.The findings for our patients, particularly in those who underwent additional high resolution MRI, did not provide evidence of a lack of CN IV as a cause of Brown syndrome. Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The distance from the annulus of Zinn to the trochlea was the same in both eyes.

5a742d620384be9551000002	Which disease risk can be estimated with the Stop-Bang questionnaire?	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of "apple body type" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CONCLUSION: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.  High and low probability of OSA were defined as a STOP-Bang score of ≥5 (h-OSA) and of<5 (l-OSA), respectively. The STOP-BANG questionnaire improves the detection of epilepsy patients at risk for obstructive sleep apnea. We performed a quality improvement project, evaluating for improvements in the screening of OSA in epilepsy patients using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  Diagnostic accuracy of the Berlin questionnaire, STOP-BANG, STOP, and Epworth sleepiness scale in detecting obstructive sleep apnea: A bivariate meta-analysis. Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial.  Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable. Modified Mallampati Score Improves Specificity of STOP-BANG Questionnaire for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. BACKGROUND: An accurate, clinical screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that identifies patients for further diagnostic testing would assist in the diagnosis of this comorbidity. One example, the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), has been validated as a screening tool with high sensitivity. The validated Berlin, STOP-BANG, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires were administered to all eligible subjects to assess SA risk and daytime somnolence, and their demographic and clinical information, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of depression were collected using the questionnaires. Ninety-nine (49.5%) subjects were identified as high risk for SA using the Berlin questionnaire, whereas 26 (13%), 137 (68.5%), and 37 (18.5%) subjects were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk for SA, respectively, using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  CONCLUSIONS: The SACS and the STOP-Bang questionnaires (BMI threshold of 25 kg/m2) were found to provide the best positive and negative LRs, respectively, for the prediction of OSA. The aims of this study were to (1) explore the incidence of right-sided heart dysfunction (RHD) and STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and (2) assess the relationship between patients with STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with OSA and echocardiographic findings suggestive of RHD. This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. Validation of the STOP-Bang Questionnaire as a Screening Tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Different Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Validation of a Portuguese version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea: Analysis in a sleep clinic. This meta-analysis confirms the high performance of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in the sleep clinic and surgical population for screening of OSA. <b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</b>: The present review aims to provide an update on the various practical applications of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in anesthesia, surgery, and perioperative medicine.<br><b>RECENT FINDINGS</b>: The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0--2 can be classified as low-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Further, patients with a STOP-Bang score at least 3 can be classified as high risk for moderate-to-severe OSA if the serum HCO3 at least 28 mmol/l. STOP-Bang can be used as a novel tool for perioperative risk stratification because it easily identifies patients who are at increased risk of perioperative complications.<br><b>SUMMARY</b>: STOP-Bang at least 3 was recommended previously to identify the suspected or undiagnosed OSA. Because of its practical application, STOP-Bang is a useful screening tool for patients with suspected or undiagnosed OSA.<br> The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3. Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk. Evaluation of the Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea. The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients. Alternative scoring models of STOP-bang questionnaire improve specificity to detect undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic. This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. This study aimed to compare the efficiency of the STOP-BANG and Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaires for evaluating potential respiratory complications during the perioperative period. OBJECTIVE The STOP-Bang questionnaire was developed as a quick and simple screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preoperative clinics. This study aimed to evaluate and validate the Arabic version of Stop-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for patients with OSA symptoms referred to a sleep clinic. RESULTS Eighty-three out of 200 patients had a high risk of OSA based on the STOP-Bang questionnaire. CONCLUSION The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic. RECENT FINDINGS The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We aimed to evaluate the validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire to predict moderate-to-severe and severe OSA in the general population. STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine if a high score (≥ 3) on the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicts whether obese patients are at high risk for OSA and increased risk of difficult airway. CONCLUSION The STOP-Bang questionnaire can be used as a screening tool in the general population in view of its moderate sensitivity and high negative predictive value for subjects with moderate-to-severe and severe OSA. Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of AR and the STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness during daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender), a validated screening method to identify obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3. The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients. PURPOSE This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Over 40% of MS patients were identified as high risk for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The high-risk group patients identified by STOP-BANG had significantly higher respiratory disturbance index and lower minimum oxygen saturation than the low-risk group patients.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Among the four questionnaires studied, STOP-BANG, with only eight questions and the highest sensitivity, is the best questionnaire of the four for OSA screening. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: The present study validates and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of four internationally popular questionnaires, translated into Chinese, for assessing suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, namely, the Berlin questionnaire, the ASA checklist, the STOP questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. We hypothesized that the STOP-Bang questionnaire, a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can predict difficult intubation.<br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b>: In this prospective cohort study, 200 adult surgical patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied to evaluate the usefulness of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for predicting difficult intubation.

5e36dc8cb5b409ea5300000d	What is another name for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)?	Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMd, Niemann-Pick disease A/B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B).  Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficient Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene. The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form.  BACKGROUND  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Introduction  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B). Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase.

56ed14d92ac5ed145900000a	What is the genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis?	The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors Ten years ago, a mutation in the TSC2 gene was identified in the Eker rat at Fox Chase Cancer Center by Yeung and Knudson, and in Tokyo by Kobayashi and Hino. Here, we will review the clinical association of RCC in TSC, consider the factors that have led to its under-emphasis within the RCC field, address the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to RCC in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and finally discuss the ways in which the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to sporadic RCC in the general population. Either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, can be mutated, resulting in the tuberous sclerosis complex phenotype. The protein products of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), have been discovered to play important roles in several cell-signaling pathways Knowledge regarding the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex has led to therapeutic intervention trials.  TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease. We previously found TSC2 loss of heterozygosity in 7 of 13 (54%) of angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients, suggesting that LAM and TSC could have a common genetic basis. Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex gene TSC2 are a cause of sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis The disease can be caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC2, identified in 1993, and TSC1, only recently identified. Molecular genetic basis of renal carcinogenesis in the Eker rat model of tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2) We have recently identified on rat chromosome 10q a germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis gene (Tsc2), the gene predisposing to renal carcinoma (RC) in the Eker rat Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene that can result in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organ systems Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway.

601ebbeb1cb411341a00005b	What syndrome is associated with mutations in lysine methyltransferase 2D KMT2D?	Kabuki syndrome (KS) is commonly caused by mutations in the histone-modifying enzyme lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D).  Identification of KMT2D and KDM6A variants by targeted sequencing from patients with Kabuki syndrome and other congenital disorders. Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facies, postnatal growth deficiency, cardiac defects and skeletal anomalies. Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes are the major causes of KS. Pathogenic variants in KMT2D, which encodes lysine specific methyltransferase 2D, cause autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome, associated with distinctive dysmorphic features including arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lower lid, large protuberant ears, and fetal finger pads We describe here four patients (including one previously published patient) with de novo KMT2D missense variants and with shared but unusual clinical findings not typically seen in Kabuki syndrome These findings significantly expand the phenotypic spectrum of features associated with variants in KMT2D beyond those seen in Kabuki syndrome and suggest a possible new underlying disease mechanism for these patients. Kabuki syndrome is characterized by a variable degree of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, and complications in various organs. Many variants have been identified in two causative genes, that is, lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A) Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder.  Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1).  Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). BACKGROUND: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is commonly caused by mutations in the histone-modifying enzyme lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D). JECTIVE: We sought to characterize the humoral immune defects found in patients with KS with lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations.ME LTS: We report frequent mutations in the lysine methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D) (also known as MLL2), a key regulator of transcriptional enhancer function.

We  Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7LOF) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2DLOF), respectively. Although these two syndromes are clinically ONS: In patients with KS, autosomal dominant KMT2D mutations are associated with dysregulation of terminal B-cell differentiation, leading to humoral immune deficiency and, in some cases, autoimmunity. All pat MT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT  KS was confirmed by genetic testing, which revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 16 of KMT2D (c.4485C>A, Tyr1495Ter). To the best of our Pathogenic variants in KMT2D, which encodes lysine specific methyltransferase 2D, cause autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome, associated with distinctive dysmorphic features including arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lower lid, large protuberant ears, and fetal finger pads. We describe here four patients (including one previously published patient) with de novo KMT2D missense variants and with shared but unusual clinical findings not typically seen in Kabuki syndrome, including athelia (absent nipples), choanal atresia, hypoparathyroidism, delayed or absent pubertal development, and extreme short stature. KMT2D, which encodes a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, has been implicated in human congenital heart disease in the context of Kabuki syndrome. Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder. Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. e sought to characterize the humoral immune defects found in patients with KS with lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations.ME atients with KS, autosomal dominant KMT2D mutations are associated with dysregulation of terminal B-cell differentiation, leading to humoral immune deficiency and, in some cases, autoimmunity. All Mutations in the KMT2D gene, which encodes a H3K4 histone methyltransferase, are the major cause of Kabuki syndrome. The major cause of Kabuki syndrome are mutations in KMT2D, a gene encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase belonging to the group of chromatin modifiers.

60805e204e6a4cf630000002	What is the cause of the Kleefstra syndrome?	Kleefstra syndrome is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by a subtelomeric 9q34.3 deletion or by an intragenic mutation of the euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 gene (EHMT1). Kleefstra syndrome is a disorder caused by a mutation in the EHMT1 gene characterized in humans by general developmental delay, mild to severe intellectual disability and autism.  Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a chromosomal deletion at 9q34.3 resulting in pathogenic variants of the gene that codes for the enzyme, euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1).  Mutations in the Euchromatic Histone Methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene cause Kleefstra syndrome, a rare form of intellectual disability (ID) with strong autistic traits and sensory processing deficits. Kleefstra syndrome (chromosome 9q34.3 deletion) is a rare genetic disorder with less than 110 patients reported till date. 	['Mutations in the Euchromatic Histone Methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1)']

56c8274f5795f9a73e00000d	Which type of cells is affected in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?	Activation of microglia, CNS resident immune cells, is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons. We report that both small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 1 and SUMO2/3 modify ALS-linked SOD1 mutant proteins at lysine 75 in a motoneuronal cell line, the cell type affected in ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by ascending muscle weakness, atrophy and paralysis. Early muscle abnormalities that precede motor neuron loss in ALS may destabilize neuromuscular junctions, and we have previously demonstrated alterations in myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) expression in vivo and in the activation of myofiber-associated skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) in the mouse model of ALS (SOD1-G93A). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In the ALS motor neurons, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is dislocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm and forms inclusions, suggesting that loss of a nuclear function of TDP-43 may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. Development of an in vitro model system for ALS is expected to help in obtaining novel insights into disease mechanisms and discovery of therapeutics. We report the establishment of an in vitro FALS model from human embryonic stem cells overexpressing either a wild-type (WT) or a mutant SOD1 (G93A) gene and the evaluation of the phenotypes and survival of the spinal motor neurons (sMNs), which are the neurons affected in ALS patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease and evidence from mice expressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing SOD1 mutations suggest that neurodegeneration is a non-cell autonomous process where microglial cells influence disease progression In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting the motoneurones of the central nervous system (CNS), stem cell-based therapy aims to replace dying host motoneurones by transplantation of cells in disease-affected regions In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity is traditionally thought to be the result of degeneration of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, although degeneration of other neuronal types, in particular serotonergic neurons, might also represent a cause of spasticity.  Stem cell research raises hopes for incurable neurodegenerative diseases. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), affecting the motoneurones of the central nervous system (CNS), stem cell-based therapy aims to replace dying host motoneurones by transplantation of cells in disease-affected regions.

52bf1d9e03868f1b06000010	To the ligand of which receptors does Denosumab (Prolia) bind?	Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. Treatment of AML cells with the clinically available RANKL Ab Denosumab resulted in enhanced NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity.  The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the "vicious cycle" of bone destruction induced by these cells. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. In the future, the armamentarium against osteoporotic fractures will likely be enriched by (1.) new bone anabolic substances such as antibodies directed against the endogenous inhibitors of bone formation sclerostin and dickkopf-1, PTH and PTHrp analogues, and possibly calcilytics; (2.) new inhibitors of bone resorption such as cathepsin K inhibitors which may suppress osteoclast function without impairing osteoclast viability and thus maintain bone formation by preserving the osteoclast-osteoblast crosstalk, and denosumab, an already widely available antibody against RANKL which inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival; and (3.) new therapeutic strategies based on an extended understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis which may include sequential therapies with two or more bone active substances aimed at optimising the management of bone capital acquired during adolescence and maintained during adulthood in terms of both quantity and quality.  Clearly, the approval of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL, has just marked the beginning of a new era for bone therapy with several additional new therapies lining up for clinical approval in the coming years. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months. More recently, a nuclear factor-β ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been             developed for the treatment of bone metastases. Denosumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to RANKL and has recently been found to inhibit SRE more effectively than BP.  Recently, denosumab, a noncytotoxic IgG2 monoclonal antibody with high affinity for human RANKL, has been demonstrated to significantly prevent clinically relevant increase in pain compared with zoledronic acid across the tumor types.  Denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody with proven antiosteoclast activity, may suppress immune responses.  We also review unresolved controversies surrounding the management of these conditions by administration of nutritional vitamin D (ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol), vitamin D receptor activators (calcitriol, alphacalcidiol, doxercalciferol), D-mimetics (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol), calcimimetics (cinacalcet), recombinant PTH (teriparatide), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand modulators (denosumab); compare mortality predictability of PTH and alkaline phosphatase; and examine potential risks of bone disorders and mineral disarrays in CKD patients. New therapies such as the antibody to RANKL (denosumab) are undergoing phase III clinical testing.  Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand is an important cytokine involved in osteoclast activation; denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to this molecule, has finished a major fracture trial.  Initials studies have demonstrated that targeting RANK/ RANKL signaling with the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab prevented skeletal complications in patients with MM and other cancers with bone metastases.  A highly specific, fully human antibody against RANKL has been produced (denosumab) that in early studies in humans reduces bone turnover and improves bone density. Denosumab (AMG 162), a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, shares the pharmacologic attributes of OPG but has a significantly longer half-life that allows less frequent administration.

601f105e1cb411341a000071	Herpes viruses have what type of genome?	Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 are nuclear-replicating viruses composed of a double-stranded DNA genome  Vectors derived from herpes simplex virus provide a means of gene delivery to postmitotic neurons. The virus is readily taken up at nerve terminals, passes by rapid retrograde and anterograde transport within neurons, and is selectively transferred across synapses, thus allowing it entry from the periphery into the brain. This virus can enter a state of latency in some neurons, where it exists as an episomal element in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active to a reduced extent. In this state, the virus is apparently benign and can effect stable expression of foreign genes. The large (150 kb) genome of this double-stranded virus has been completely sequenced The Herpesviridae are a family of viruses which have a large genome of linear, double-stranded DNA (> 120 kb) Herpesviruses have large double-stranded linear DNA genomes that are formed by site-specific cleavage from complex concatemeric intermediates.

Herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are doublestranded DNA viruses with a genome size of 152 kbp. Herpes simplex virus has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with directly repeated terminal sequences needed for cleavage and packaging of replicated DNA. Like all herpes viruses, the virus has a large double-stranded DNA genome within an icosahedral nucleocapsid. Herpesviruses are large double stranded DNA animal viruses with the distinguishing ability to establish latent, life-long infections.	['double stranded DNA']

530f900ee3eabad021000003	Which hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome?	This syndrome is characterized by axial hypotonia, severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, spastic paraplegia, and a typical thyroid hormone profile.  Our case and the review of the pertinent literature suggest that Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome should be suspected in males with the typical neurological and thyroid profile, even in cases with normal brain myelination. Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition, is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays, in combination with altered thyroid hormone levels, in particular, high serum T3 levels.  Mutations in the MCT8 gene are associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), consisting of severe psychomotor retardation and disturbed TH parameters. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition, is characterized by severe intellectual disability, dysarthria, athetoid movements, muscle hypoplasia and spastic paraplegia in combination with altered TH levels, in particular, high serum T3 levels.  In two generations its presence was detected in the hemizygous state in two males with neurological abnormalities including mental retardation, axial hypotonia, hypertonia of arms and legs and athetoid movements. One of them presented normal thyroid hormone levels.  Our results show the difficulty of distinguishing AHDS from patients with X-linked intellectual disability solely on the basis of clinical features and biochemical tests, and we advise screening for MCT8 mutations in either young or older patients with severe intellectual disability, axial hypotonia/dystonia, poor head control, spastic paraplegia, and athetoid movements even when they have normal thyroid hormone profiles. Hemizygous MCT8 mutations in males cause severe psychomotor retardation, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), and abnormal serum TH levels. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe psychomotor retardation characterized by neurological impairment and abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels.  The hallmarks of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, caused by MCT8 mutations, are severe psychomotor retardation and elevated T(3) levels. Inactivating mutations in the gene encoding MCT8 are associated with a severe form of psychomotor retardation and abnormal serum TH levels (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome).  Mutations of this transporter determine a distinct X-linked psychomotor retardation syndrome (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS)) that is attributed to disturbed thyroid hormone levels, especially elevated T(3) levels. This syndrome is characterized by abnormally high T3, low/normal T4 serum levels and slightly elevated serum TSH. High D1 activity in liver and kidney increases T4 and rT3 deiodination, and contributes to the increased serum T3. One of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe mental retardation associated with abnormal thyroid hormone constellations.  The endocrine phenotype showed low serum total and free thyroxine (T4), very elevated total and free triiodothyronine (T3) and normal thyrotropin (TSH) with blunted response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8, SLC16A2) is a thyroid hormone (TH) transmembrane transport protein mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe X-linked psychomotor retardation.  The clinical importance of TH transporters is dramatically shown in patients with mutations in MCT8, suffering from severe X-linked psychomotor retardation in combination with disturbed TH levels, especially high serum T(3) levels, now referred as Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS).  Therefore, the criterion for MCT8 mutation screening in these patients is the profile of increased T(3) and low-normal to low FT(4) serum levels. However, T3 level was elevated. AIM: Mutations in the SLC16A2 gene have been implicated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked learning disability* syndrome associated with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities. Dystonic cerebral palsy was the most common initial clinical diagnosis, and AHDS was suspected only retrospectively, considering the characteristically abnormal thyroid function tests, with high serum tri-iodothyronine (T(3)), as the most consistent finding. Although dysmorphic features suggestive of AHDS are not always present, T(3) measurement is a reliable screening test. Mutations in one of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), have been identified as underlying cause for the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked mental retardation in which the patients also present with abnormally high 3',3,5-triiodothyronine (T(3)) plasma levels. With the discovery of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a specific thyroid hormone transporter and the finding that mutations in this transporter lead to a syndrome of severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine levels known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, the interest in this area of research has greatly increased.  Elevated serum triiodothyronine and intellectual and motor disability with paroxysmal dyskinesia caused by a monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene mutation. Additionally, the patient has a lesion in the left putamen region revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and elevated serum T3 levels. The identified MCT8 gene mutation (R271H) is very likely to be the genetic cause for neuronal hypothyroidism despite elevated serum T3 levels. Abnormal transport function is reflected by elevated free T3 and decreased free T4 levels along with clinical features characterized by neurological abnormalities including global developmental delay, central hypotonia, rotatory nystagmus, impaired hearing, spasticity and contractures of joints. We report a child with classical clinical features along with confirmatory deranged thyroid levels in blood. Consistent with previous reports on MCT8 missense changes, the patient with c.1673G>A showed elevated serum T3 level.  Moreover, we characterized a de novo translocation t(X;9)(q13.2;p24) in a female patient with full blown AHDS clinical features including elevated serum T3 levels. Taken together, these data indicate that MCT8 mutations are not common in non-AHDS MR patients yet they support that elevated serum T3 levels can be indicative for AHDS and that AHDS clinical features can be present in female MCT8 mutation carriers whenever there is unfavorable nonrandom X-inactivation. Endocrine functions other than thyroid hormone regulation and metabolism were intact, resulting in normal hypothalamic/pituitary function tests. Conclusion: the characteristic thyroid hormone function tests and brain MRI findings may allow screening of high-risk populations for a better understanding of MCT8 pathophysiology. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range. Pathogenic mutations in the MCT8 gene, which encodes a thyroid hormone transporter, results in elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, which were confirmed in four affected males of this family, while normal levels were found among obligate carriers. In addition, the severe muscle hypoplasia observed in most AHDS patients may be a consequence of high serum T3 levels. Abnormal transporter function is reflected in elevated free triiodothyronine and lowered free thyroxine levels in the blood.  Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development.

601ebba41cb411341a00005a	Which R/Bioconductor package has been developed for visualizing differential amino acid group usage in proteomics?	dagLogo: An R/Bioconductor package for identifying and visualizing differential amino acid group usage in proteomics data Sequence logos have been widely used as graphical representations of conserved nucleic acid and protein motifs. Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.

5c960f21ecadf2e73f000020	What are DMARDs?	To determine the utility of ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  [DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs)]. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have largely contributed to recent paradigm shift of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategy. BACKGROUND Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are increasingly used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Tocilizumab (TCZ) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response (IR) to prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disorder of joints that is associated with high health care costs, yet guidance is lacking on how early to initiate biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a class of medications that is the major cost driver in RA management. BACKGROUND Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is typically characterized by the sequential use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). There are only six DMARDs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) available in the clinical practice, such as gold sodium thiomalate, D-penicillamine, bucillamine, auranofin, salazosulphapyridine, and lobenzarit disodium. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz(®)) is the first approved drug in a new class of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. OBJECTIVE Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard of care for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, studies have found that many patients do not receive them. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pharmacotherapy and should be initiated promptly after RA diagnosis. OBJECTIVES When rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have achieved sustained good clinical responses can their disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) be reduced or discontinued? BACKGROUND Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. BACKGROUND Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve outcomes compared to conventional therapy (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroids). Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of drugs which is used as medication in various arthritic conditions to arrest the progression of disease along with relief from pain. For this purpose, all patients with the diagnosis of RA should be treated by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including biologic DMARDs and non-biologic DMARDs. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Patients and rheumatologists have a number of options to consider for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). To explore what considerations patients have when deciding about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and what information patients need to participate in the decision-making process. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy is now clearly accepted as the primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, with an increasing emphasis on use of combination therapy. (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? The efficacy of the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) shown in clinical trials may be jeopardized due to prevalent poor patient adherence. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism.

Identification of KMT2D and KDM6A variants by targeted sequencing from patients with Kabuki syndrome and other congenital disorders Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes are the major causes of KS Overall, we uncovered 11 novel variants - nine in KMT2D and two in KDM6A. Seven of the novel variants (all KMT2D) were likely causative of the KS phenotype. Two genes have been shown to be mutated in patients with KS: lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) and lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D, formerly MLL2). Finally, understanding the interactions between KMT2D and its target genes could unravel other candidate genes for hitherto unexplained Kabuki syndrome cases. Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined.

56bb621fac7ad10019000009	What causes Katayama Fever?	The laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers is difficult because the number of excreted eggs is often very limited. Eosinophilia (sometimes exceeding 50%) is often present in patients with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), but may be limited or absent in late fibrotic manifestations of the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers The specific diagnosis of early schistosomiasis and Katayama fever relies essentially on serologic tests or preferably on PCR (if available).  BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infection. Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. In Africa, it predominantly manifests as urogenital disease, and the main infective agent is Schistosoma hematobium. His symptoms were caused by acute invasive schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of imported Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) as well as evolution and outcome under treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Katayama fever by Schistosoma egg detection and/or by seroconversion.  The best therapeutic approach to acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is still unsettled. Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. Acute schistosomiasis, called safari's fever in Africa and Katayama fever in Japan, is an immunoallergic reaction due to transcutaneous penetration of infective cercaria.

Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer.  Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here we investigated whether 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis, was involved in regulating DNA hypomethylation and hyper-hydroxymethylation in lupus CD4<br> DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls. Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.

52b2e498f828ad283c000010	Mutation of which gene is associated with Achondroplasia?	She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals who may be too young to diagnose with certainty or in individuals with atypical findings, molecular genetic testing can be used to detect a mutation in FGFR3. Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development. The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380. To investigate the mutation at the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) nucleotide 1138 site for identifying the major pathologic mechanism of achondroplasia (ACH) and to evaluate the efficacy of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) method for screening the point mutations.  Nucleotide 1138 in transmembrane domain of FGFR3 gene is the hot point for mutation in ACH and hence its major pathologic cause.  The nucleotide 1138 of FGFR3 gene is also the hotspot of mutation in Chinese patients with ACH. A simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method has been set up to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic dwarfism. The diagnosis of achondroplasia was based on the presence of clinical and radiographic findings and confirmed by the presence of a common FGFR3 gene mutation (Gly380Arg) detected by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.  The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of achondroplasia. To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of short-limb dwarfism. Recently, the gene mutation responsible for ACH has been identified in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The cause of ACH is a point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA, resulting in the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine.  Recent studies mapped the achondroplasia gene on chromosome region 4p16.3 and identified a common mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).

58ee2515eda5a57672000016	Which individuals show preferential colonization of the Prevotellaceae bacteria in their guts?	a new member of the Prevotellaceae family that was isolated from stool samples from a 45-year-old patient. Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8.1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8.1 carriers than non-carriers. The increase in Bacteroidetes was found to be due to an increase in members of the families Bacteroidaceae or Prevotellaceae.  Fecal communities clustered into previously described enterotypes distinguished primarily by levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella. Although the distinction of enterotypes as either discrete clusters or a continuum will require additional investigation, numerous studies have demonstrated the co-exclusion of the closely related Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides genera in the gut microbiota of healthy human subjects where Prevotella appears to be a discriminatory taxon for residence in more agrarian societies Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the active microbiota Specifically, Firmicutes were dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals but significantly decreased in post-gastric-bypass individuals, who had a proportional increase of Gammaproteobacteria. Numbers of the H(2)-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that these two species are members of the family 'Prevotellaceae' but are phylogenetically distant (<88% sequence similarity) from the known genera belonging to this family, including Prevotella, Hallela and Xylanibacter.

52c7275103868f1b0600001c	What is the inheritance pattern of Apert syndrome?	The Apert syndrome is a rare disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene at locus 10q26; patients with this syndrome present severe syndactyly, exophthalmia, ocular hypertelorism and hypoplastic midface with Class III malocclusion, besides systemic alterations. The Apert syndrome is characterized by craniosynostosis and syndactyly of hands and feet. Although most cases are sporadic, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is well documented. Apert syndrome, or acrocephalosyndactyly, is characterized by craniosynostosis and early epiphyseal closure resulting in various deformities of the skull, hands, and feet. Typically a sporadic condition, autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance has been known to occur.  We report two observations of antenatal diagnosis of Apert syndrome. This uncommon genetic disorder suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance, but almost all cases described are sporadic; the responsible gene is yet not located. The familial cases, the equal number of affected males and females, and the increased paternal age in sporadic cases strongly suggest autosomal dominant inheritance.  This report presents the first example of male transmission of Apert acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome. Female transmission has been reported in the five previous well-documented cases of dominant inheritance of the syndrome.	['Autosomal dominant']
58b6bd2622d300530900000c	Which ApoE isoform is associated with hyperlipoproteinemia?	ApoE2 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Arg158Cys located near the LDLR recognition site exhibits impaired binding to the receptor and an inability to promote clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles; this isoform is associated with Type-III hyperlipoproteinemia.  Type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP), a disorder associated with a high incidence of premature cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma. The primary genetic defect in patients with type III HLP is the presence of apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2), an isoform of apoE, and accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma has been thought to be attributable to the presence of apoE2, which bind poorly to low density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in defective remnant lipoprotein clearance.  ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele.  Reduced expression of the LDLR is believed to be a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in some humans homozygous for the apoE2 allele (APOE*2).  Overall, the 2.3-fold normal level of LDLR message in heterozygotes completely ameliorates type III HLP caused by the homozygosity for the human APOE*2 allele, normalizing their plasma lipoprotein profile. Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia and spontaneous atherosclerosis in mice resulting from gene replacement of mouse Apoe with human Apoe*2. Mice expressing human apoE2 (2/2) have virtually all the characteristics of type III hyperlipoproteinemia.  ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Type III hyperlipoproteinemia typically is associated with homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158----Cys). ApoE is a polymorphic protein, and homozygosity for the E2 allele is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Homozygosity for the apolipoprotein (apo) E variant apoE2(158 Arg----Cys) invariably gives rise to dysbetalipoproteinemia, and when associated with obesity or a gene for hyperlipidemia, results in type III hyperlipoproteinemia. ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). From the data of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of hyperlipoproteinemia. Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist Whereas the association of the apo E2 isoform with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia type III is well established, the plasma- and LDL-cholesterol lowering effects of apo E2 and the phenomenon of apo E4 raising these parameters on the development of coronary heart disease is still a matter of controversial discussion.  The primary genetic defect in patients with type III HLP is the presence of apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2), an isoform of apoE, and accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma has been thought to be attributable to the presence of apoE2, which bind poorly to low density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in defective remnant lipoprotein clearance.  In the normal population, ApoE3 isoform is the most prevalent, and ApoE2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. ApoE2 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Arg158Cys located near the LDLR recognition site exhibits impaired binding to the receptor and an inability to promote clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles; this isoform is associated with Type-III hyperlipoproteinemia. In the normal population apo E3 isoform is most prevalent and apo E2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. From the data of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of hyperlipoproteinemia. We describe a new variant of apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, which is, in contrast to apoE-2, dominantly associated with type III HLP. ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by delayed chylomicron and VLDL remnant catabolism and is associated with homozygosity for the apoE-2 allele. The association of the E2/2 phenotype with type IV/V hyperlipoproteinemia rather than type III hyperlipoproteinemia in identical twin brothers led us to investigate the primary structure of their apoE. ApoE2 is defective in binding and homozygosity for apoE2 is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Homozygous carriers of apoE2 have an increased risk to develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia, whereas apoE4 is associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Patients homozygous for apolipoprotein E2 are predisposed to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and apoE2 may be protective against AD.	['ApoE2 isoform', 'Apolipoprotein E2 isoform']
56e2cec751531f7e33000015	What is the structural fold of bromodomain proteins?	These new studies also support the notion that functional diversity of a conserved bromodomain structural fold is achieved by evolutionary changes of structurally flexible amino-acid sequences in the ligand binding site such as the ZA and BC loops. Although the overall fold resembles the bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences can be found in loop regions, especially in the ZA loop in which a two amino acids insertion is involved in an uncommon pi-helix, termed piD In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal bromodomain (BD1, residues 74-194) of human BRD2. This is the first observation of a homodimer among the known bromodomain structures, through the buried hydrophobic core region at the interface. The Brg1 bromodomain conserves the left-handed, four-helix bundle topology found in other bromodomain structures. However, the alphaZ helix of Brg1 bromodomain is about 4 residues shorter relative to previously published bromodomain structures. Here, we report the solution structure of BRD7 bromodomain determined by NMR spectroscopy, and its binding specificity revealed by NMR titration with several acetylated histone peptides. The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of the double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side, four-helix bundles with a highly polarized surface charge distribution The structure has a left-handed four-helix bundle topology, with two short additional helices in a long connecting loop. The structure reveals an unusual left-handed up-and-down four-helix bundle.  In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein.

56f553e309dd18d46b000006	What is the function of the spliceosome complex?	The spliceosome machinery is composed of multimeric protein complexes that generate a diverse repertoire of mRNA through coordinated splicing of heteronuclear RNAs.  Splicing and alternate splicing are the two key biological processes that result in the generation of diverse transcript and protein isoforms in Plasmodium falciparum as well as in other eukaryotic organisms.   Spliceosome assembly belongs to the key processes that enable splicing of mRNA and modulate alternative splicing. The excision of introns from nascent eukaryotic transcripts is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a highly complex and dynamic macromolecular machine composed of RNA and protein.  Recent advances have begun to provide exciting new insights into the dynamic interactions that govern the function of the spliceosome, the multi-megadalton complex that performs splicing.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a support modality used within the pediatric cardiac ICU population as a bridge to recovery or decision in the setting of acute myocardial decompensation, support for combined cardiopulmonary failure or in the setting of refractory cardiopulmonary arrest. Pati OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a widely used technique for treating postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS); however, no study has compared the long-term outcomes of patients who receive ECMO support for PCS with those of the general population post cardiac su Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a kind of technique that uses extracorporeal circulation system to draw patients' blood into the circuit, and then oxygenate the blood when it passes along the membrane, followed by returning the blood into patients. At pr FINDINGS: Major technological improvements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines and the positive results of the conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR) trial have reignited interest in VV-ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent hypoxemia or hypercarbia on conventional mechanical ventilation. BACKGROUND: The use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the adult patient has increased slowly since the first reported successful treatment in 1972 (Hill et al., 1972) and is seen increasingly as a successful therapy when conventional medical treatment has failed.

5a9700adfcd1d6a10c00002c	Sclerostin regulates what process?	 Sclerostin is a soluble antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling secreted primarily by osteocytes. Current evidence indicates that sclerostin likely functions as a local/paracrine regulator of bone metabolism rather than as an endocrine hormone.  After discovering that lack of Sost/sclerostin expression is the cause of the high bone mass human syndromes Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis, extensive animal experimentation and clinical studies demonstrated that sclerostin plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and that its deficiency or pharmacological neutralization increases bone formation Sclerostin is a locally acting regulator of late-osteoblast/preosteocyte differentiation and regulates mineralization through a MEPE-ASARM-dependent mechanism. The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. Sclerostin is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of bone mass. Sclerostin secreted by osteocytes is mechanosensory and important in bone remodeling. Sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt signaling pathway and also has an important role in postmenopausal bone loss. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt pathway signaling. Sclerostin, an osteocyte-expressed negative regulator of bone formation, is one of the inhibitors of Wnt signaling that is a critical pathway in the correct process of osteoblast differentiation. Sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein, regulates osteoblast function. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt signaling pathway and also has an important role in postmenopausal bone loss. Since sclerostin expression is confined to the bone-resorbing osteoclast, it provides a mechanism whereby bone apposition is inhibited in the vicinity of resorption. Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Sclerostin regulates release of bone mineral by osteocytes by induction of carbonic anhydrase 2. The secreted glycoprotein, sclerostin alters bone formation. Sclerostin, encoded by the sost gene, and a product of the osteocyte, is a negative regulator of bone formation.  Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity and bone turnover, and it plays a role in cardiovascular calcification processes.   Sclerostin plays a major role in regulating skeletal bone mass, but its effects in articular cartilage are not known. Sclerostin is a key negative regulator of bone formation Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation In humans, the SOST gene encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone growth and remodeling, which also negatively regulates the bone repair process.

The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects. Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power to detect such signals through meta-analyses. In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing, storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS. The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS.

589635dd78275d0c4a000009	Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?	LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations. In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a β-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org).

54e0d1491388e8454a000014	Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?	Efficacy and safety profile of evolocumab (AMG145), an injectable inhibitor of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9: the available clinical evidence. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation.  Efficacy and safety of evolocumab (AMG 145), a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, in hyperlipidaemic patients on various background lipid therapies: pooled analysis of 1359 patients in four phase 2 trials. We report a pooled analysis from four phase 2 studies of evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9.  Reduction in lipoprotein(a) with PCSK9 monoclonal antibody evolocumab (AMG 145): a pooled analysis of more than 1,300 patients in 4 phase II trials. METHODS: A pooled analysis of data from 1,359 patients in 4 phase II trials assessed the effects of evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, on Lp(a), the relationship between Lp(a) and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the influence of background statin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab resulted in significant dose-related reductions in Lp(a).  Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, including evolocumab (previously AMG 145), dramatically lowered LDL-C in phase 2 clinical trials when administered alone or in combination with a statin.  Evolocumab (AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9, inhibiting its interaction with the LDL receptor to preserve LDL-receptor recycling and reduce LDL-C. Antibody therapeutics in Phase 3 studies are described, with an emphasis on those with study completion dates in 2014, including antibodies targeting interleukin-17a or the interleukin-17a receptor (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (alirocumab, evolocumab, bococizumab), and programmed death 1 receptor (lambrolizumab, nivolumab). BACKGROUND: Evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in phase 2 studies of 12 weeks' duration.  These compounds act either by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) production by inhibiting apolipoprotein B synthesis with an antisense oligonucleotide (mipomersen) or by inhibiting microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (lomitapide), or by enhancing LDL catabolism via monoclonal antibody-mediated inhibition of the activity of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) (evolocumab).  Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (TESLA Part B): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), reduced LDL cholesterol by 16% in a pilot study.  PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (RUTHERFORD-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We investigated the effect of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab (AMG 145) on LDL cholesterol in patients with this disorder.  Some of the anti-dyslipidemic drugs which work by PCSK9 inhibition include evolocumab, alirocumab and ALN-PCS. We highlight the different steps of this adventure and review the published clinical trials especially those with the anti-PCSK9 antibodies evolocumab (AMG 145) and alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727), which are in phase III trials. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 represent so far the most advanced approach in clinical development, with alirocumab, evolocumab and bococizumab under advanced clinical development.  AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that binds to hepatic LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation. Phase II (for evolocumab and alirocumab) and III (for evolocumab) trials show that PCSK9 inhibitors are equally well tolerated, with adverse events mainly limited to mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis, injection-site pain, arthralgia and back pain.  Four classes of newer lipid-lowering drugs offer promising advances in treating FH, namely the apolipoprotein-B synthesis inhibitors (mipomersen), the microsomal transfer protein inhibitors (lomitapide), the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (anacetrapib, evacetrapib) and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab). Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades the LDL receptor, like alirocumab and evolocumab, are in phase 3 trials. In support of the drug development program for Evolocumab, a fully human IgG₂ antibody that targets PCSK9, a quantitative ELISA to measure free PCSK9 in human serum was developed.  IMPORTANCE: In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.  Anti-PCSK9 antibody effectively lowers cholesterol in patients with statin intolerance: the GAUSS-2 randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of evolocumab. Evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), demonstrated marked reductions in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in a phase 2 study in statin-intolerant patients. Anti-PCSK9 monotherapy for hypercholesterolemia: the MENDEL-2 randomized, controlled phase III clinical trial of evolocumab. BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced LDL-C in phase II trials.  BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in phase 2 studies.  Effects of evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, in hypercholesterolemic, statin-treated Japanese patients at high cardiovascular risk--primary results from the phase 2 YUKAWA study.

5ebac76b0d431b5f7300000d	Which histone mark is recognized by HP1?	Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4 Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.  Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure. We show that methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (Me9H3) is a marker of heterochromatin in divergent animal species.  Finally, we provide evidence that Me9H3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to chromosomal DNA. Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tai Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing Methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 is recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which directs the binding of other proteins to control chromatin structure and gene expression.  In Drosophila S2 cells, and on polytene chromosomes, methyl-Lys 27 and Pc are both excluded from areas that are enriched in methyl-Lys 9 and HP1 To better understand the molecular basis for the selection of methyl-lysine binding sites, we solved the 1.8 A structure of the Pc chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 27, and compared it with our previously determined structure of the HP1 chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 9. Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 is important for recruiting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging and heterochromatin formation.  We investigated the role of Suz12 in constitutive heterochromatin and discovered that Suz12 is required for histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in differentiated but not undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells. Pericentric H3K9me3 Formation by HP1 Interaction-defective Histone Methyltransferase Suv39h1 Pericentric regions form epigenetically organized, silent heterochromatin structures that accumulate histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a methylated H3K9-binding protein.  LSD1 cooperates with ASXL1 in transcriptional repression, presumably by removing H3K4 methylation, an active histone mark, but not H3K9 methylation, a repressive histone mark recognized by HP1. We investigated the chromatin marks to which TFL2/LHP1 binds and show that, in vitro, TFL2/LHP1 binds to histone H3 di- or tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3), the marks recognized by HP1, and to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), the mark deposited by PRC2. Cbx3 is one of the paralogues of HP1 proteins, which has been reported to specifically recognize trimethylated histone H3K9 mark, and a consensus binding motif has been defined for the Cbx3 chromodomain. For instance, tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is important for recruiting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging, and heterochromatin formation. Here we discuss functions of the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins that recognize H3K9me, an epigenetic mark generated by the histone methyltransferases SU(VAR)3-9 and orthologues. Binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark is a hallmark of establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. Al so on. Cbx3 is one of the paralogues of HP1 proteins, which has been reported to specifically recognize trimethylated histone H3K9 mark, and a consensus binding motif has been defined for the Cbx3 chromod Until now, little was known about the regulation of effector-histone mark interactions, and in particular, of the binding of HP1 to H3K9me3. Recently, we and others presented evidence that a "binary methylation-phosphorylation switch" mechanism controls the dynamic release of HP1 from H3K9me3 during the cell cycle: phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph) occurs at the onset of mitosis, interferes with HP1-H3K9me3 interaction, and therefore, ejects HP1 from its binding site. Our simulated results further confirm the essential role of cation-pi interactions for the binding of a methylated H3 tail by an HP1 chromodomain but indicate that the effect from an electrostatic origin is not dominant in distinguishing between the H3K9Me3 mark and its unmethylated counterpart. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins, recognized readers of the heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and chromosome structure.

The hydrophobic major structural protein GvpA forms the ribbed gas vesicle wall.  The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC,  The wall of these gas vesicles is freely permeable to gas molecules and is composed of a small hydrophobic protein, GvpA, which forms a single-layer wall. Gas vesicles are intracellular, microbial flotation devices that consist of mainly one protein, GvpA. Modeling of the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA: from protein sequence to vesicle wall structure. Gas vesicle production and the expression of the gvpA gene encoding the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA, was monitored in each Haloferax volcanii transformant.

CONTENT: Although CD19-targeted agents (blinatumomab or inebilizumab) are not associated with an increased risk of infection, they may cause IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia.

5a39453d966455904c000006	Which method for subsampling of NGS reads requires only gene counts?	Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the Illumina SBS coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. Interestingly, after subsampling to the same coverage for GSNAP and TopHat, we find that both mappers have similar performance, implying that the advantage of TopHat is mainly an artifact of the lower coverage.  By subsampling sequence reads, we found that when using four-fold biological replication, 6 million reads per condition achieved 96% power to detect a two-fold change (or more) at a 5% false discovery rate. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth subSeq: determining appropriate sequencing depth through efficient read subsampling. We introduce an R package called samExploreR that allows the subsampling (m out of n bootstraping) of short-reads based on SAM files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth related questions for the experimental design. We applied subsampling to ascertain the effect of training sample size and the number of RNA sequencing reads on classification accuracy of molecular subtype and routine biomarker prediction models (unsupervised and supervised). samExploreR: exploring reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq results based on SAM files. By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing experiment and determining where the saturation of power and accuracy occurs, one can determine what the most useful depth should be for future experiments, and furthermore, confirm whether an existing experiment had sufficient depth to justify its conclusions One complication is that the power and accuracy of such experiments depend substantially on the number of reads sequenced, so it is important and challenging to determine the optimal read depth for an experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an existing experiment	['subSeq']
58efa1b870f9fc6f0f000003	What is a "chemobrain"?	Frequency of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment or "chemobrain" is mentioned to be significant in literature, although very little is known about the chemotherapy-caused chemobrain and its connection with metal homeostasis alteration. Cognitive decline or dementia is a debilitating problem of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, including special conditions like chemobrain.  Most cancer patients treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy endure long-lasting side effects including decrease in concentration, forgetfulness and slower thinking, which are globally termed "chemobrain."  The frequent use of chemotherapy to combat a range of malignancies can elicit severe cognitive dysfunction often referred to as "chemobrain," a condition that can persist long after the cessation of treatment in as many as 75% of survivors. The term "chemobrain" is sometimes used to denote deficits in neuropsychological functioning that may occur as a result of cancer treatment.

58e7902b3e8b6dc87c000007	Which is the most common gene signature in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients?	A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements.R Baseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM. This signature was also well correlated between disease-affected tissue and WB in subjects with SLE, DM, PM and SSc. We identified an arsenic exposure related 51-gene signature at PND1 and PND70 with several hubs of interaction (Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a). A CD4 T cell gene signature for early rheumatoid arthritis implicates interleukin 6-mediated STAT3 signalling, particularly in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody-negative disease A 12-gene transcriptional 'signature' identified RA patients in the training cohort and predicted the subsequent development of RA among UA patients in the validation cohort (sensitivity 68%, specificity 70%).  The involvement of HIF isoforms in generating the angiogenic signature of RA FLS stimulated with hypoxia and/or cytokines was investigated using a DNA-binding assay and RNA interference. The objective of our study was to characterise the angiogenic gene signature of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in response to hypoxia, as well as Th1 and T-helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokines, and in particular to dissect out effects of combined hypoxia and cytokines on hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) and angiogenesis. Multiple folate metabolism-related genes were consistently and significantly altered between the 3 groups in both cohorts. Concurrent with evidence of an immune-activation gene signature in MTX-naive RA patients, significant up-regulation of the folate-metabolizing enzymes γ-glutamyl hydrolase and dihydrofolate reductase, as well as the MTX/folate efflux transporters ABCC2 and ABCC5, was observed in the MTX-naive RA group compared to healthy controls. We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 30 RA patients to assess the effect of different biologic agent (biologics) treatments and to quantify the degree of a type-I interferon (IFN) signature in these patients.  The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient.  IL-17A inhibitors produced rapid down-regulation of the psoriasis gene signature and high clinical response rates in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, consistent with an important role for IL-17A in psoriasis pathogenesis.  We observed that baseline synovial myeloid, but not lymphoid, gene signature expression was higher in patients with good compared with poor European league against rheumatism (EULAR) clinical response to anti-TNFα therapy at week 16 (P =0.011).  Flow cytometry and gene profiling indicated that RA-SF macrophages express pro-inflammatory polarization markers (MMP12, EGLN3, CCR2), lack expression of markers associated with homeostatic and anti-inflammatory polarization (IGF1, HTR2B) and exhibit a transcriptomic profile that resembles the activin A-dependent gene signature of pro-inflammatory in vitro-generated macrophages. Gene expression analyses showed a greater prevalence of significantly upregulated genes in HCs with negative ANA values than in those with significant ANA positivity. Genes upregulated in high ANA HCs included a celiac disease autoantigen and some components of the Type I interferon (IFN) gene signature. We therefore initiated this study to identify signatures that would be of utility in studying rheumatoid arthritis (RA).We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 30 RA patients to assess the effect of different biologic agent (biologics) treatments and to quantify the degree of a type-I interferon (IFN) signature in these patients Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis demonstrate an interferon signature similar to but less intense than that seen in patients with lupus. To analyze the relationship between the type I interferon (IFN) signature and clinical response to rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.Twenty RA patients were treated with rituximab (cohort 1). To validate the presence and demonstrate the clinical value of the type I interferon (IFN)-signature during arthritis development.In 115 seropositive arthralgia patients who were followed for the development of arthritis (Amsterdam Reade cohort), and 25 presymptomatic individuals who developed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) later, and 45 population-based controls (Northern Sweden cohort), the expression levels of 7 type I IFN response genes were determined with multiplex qPCR and an IFN-score was calculated. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, psoriasis, and a fraction of patients with rheumatoid arthritis display a specific expression pattern of interferon-dependent genes in their leukocytes, termed the interferon signature. More recently, large-scale differential gene expression studies performed on selected tissues from patients with autoimmune disorders, have led to the identification of gene signatures associated with the activation of specific pathways in these diseases (e.g. interferon signature in lupus). Relationship between the type I interferon signature and the response to rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

56c58f1b5795f9a73e000001	Which species of bacteria did the mitochondria originate from?	Recently, α-proteobacteria have been shown to possess virus-like gene transfer agents that facilitate high frequency gene transfer in natural environments between distantly related lineages. This system could have driven the genomic integration of the mitochondrial progenitor and its proto-eukaryote host and contributed to the evolutionary mosaic of genes seen in modern-day prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Although the Alphaproteobacteria are thought to be the closest relatives of the mitochondrial progenitor, there is dispute as to what its particular sister group is. More detailed phylogenetic analyses with additional Alphaproteobacteria and including genes from the mitochondria of Reclinomonas americana found matches of mitochondrial genes to those of members of the Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, and Rhodospirillaceae families. Biologists agree that the ancestor of mitochondria was an alpha-proteobacterium. Mitochondria originated by permanent enslavement of purple non-sulphur bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses based on genes located in the mitochondrial genome indicate that these genes originated from within the alpha-proteobacteria. The strong relationship with alpha-proteobacterial genes observed for some mitochondrial genes, combined with the lack of such a relationship for others, indicates that the modern mitochondrial proteome is the product of both reductive and expansive processes. Accumulating evolutionary data point to a monophyletic origin of mitochondria from the order Rickettsiales. Evolutionary analyses of proteins encoded in the genome contain the strongest phylogenetic evidence to date for the view that mitochondria descend from alpha-proteobacteria. The functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes: no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either R. prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes, but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in R. prowazekii. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that R. prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far. The phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that mitochondria are derived from the alpha-proteobacteria and more specifically from within the Rickettsiaceae. We have estimated that the common ancestor of mitochondria and Rickettsiaceae dates back to more than 1500 million years ago. GOBASE also includes a fully reannotated genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii, one of the closest bacterial relatives of mitochondria, and will shortly expand to contain more data from bacteria from which organelles originated. The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of mitochondria. Although mitochondria derive from alpha-proteobacteria, many proteins acting in this organelle did not originate from bacteria.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries have a reported incidence of between 3 and 37%, depending on the clinical setting. The most common mechanism of injury in motor vehicle accidents is a dashboard injury or direct force to the proximal anterior tibia. Hyperflexion was the most common mechanism of injury, followed by pretibial trauma in the hyperflexed knee or in the "dashboard" injury. 	['Posterior cruciate ligament']
5a86e6fafaa1ab7d2e000036	What is the nucleotide composition of the Lamin Associated Domains (LADs)?	Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence. In metazoans, the nuclear lamina is thought to play an important role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment.

The outcomes of the clinical trials of the γ-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat (LY-450139) and the γ-secretase modulator (GSM) Tarenflurbil were disappointing, but may not represent the end of the γ-secretase era.  A selective BACE inhibitor and the γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139 (semagacestat) were used to inhibit respective secretase. ACS chemical neuroscience molecule spotlight on semagacestat (LY450139). Semagacestat (LY450139) is a novel γ-secretase inhibitor currently in late-stage development by Eli Lilly and Company as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

6030fe7a1cb411341a000128	Which class of disorders are caused by AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit defects?	AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit defects are a cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits encoded by GRIA1-4 genes. GluA2 has an especially important role because, following post-transcriptional editing at the Q607 site, it renders heteromultimeric AMPARs Ca2+-impermeable, with a linear relationship between current and trans-membrane voltage. Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels. When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification. Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

54fc91e96ad7dcbc12000001	PBT2 has been tested for which disorder?	PBT2 improved cognition in a phase II clinical trial with AD patients, and further clinical testing is currently underway. In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.  The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia.  The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight the emerging notion that metal chaperones, such as PBT2 (Prana Biotechnology), modulate a variety of critical pathways affecting key aspects of the AD cascade to provide a more "holistic" approach to the treatment of this disease. The Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2 promotes amyloid-β degradation and GSK3 phosphorylation via a metal chaperone activity. The leading compound in this class of therapeutic, PBT2, improved cognition in a clinical trial with AD patients.  Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD. Metalloproteinase modifiers such as PBT2 may be useful AD therapies, but current evidence gives no support to their immediate use in pre-symptomatic AD. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials.  PBT2 rapidly improves cognition in Alzheimer's Disease: additional phase II analyses.  A recent Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta42, and significantly improved executive function on a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within 12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD.  These findings further encourage larger-scale testing of PBT2 for AD. Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Experimental treatments potentially useful for Alzheimer's disease include dimebon, PBT2 and etanercept; the safety and efficacy of the Alzheimer's vaccine remains to be proven, and growth hormone secretagogue and tarenflurbil are likely ineffective.  The recent report of positive results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of PBT2, a novel drug that targets amyloid-beta-metal interactions, underscores the value of abnormal transition metal metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. It has performed very satisfactorily in toxicology and Phase I clinical trials and is advancing as a disease-modifying candidate drug for Alzheimer's disease. Future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness. Small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions (e.g., PBT2) are currently advancing through clinical trials and show increasing promise as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease based on the "metal hypothesis." Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD.	["Alzheimer's disease"]

5c2f669e133db5eb78000031	How many genes in S. cerevisiae are the result of an ancient whole genome duplication?	By comparing three species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, and S. castellii) that underwent WGD to a nonduplicated outgroup (Kluyveromyces lactis), and by using a synteny framework to establish orthology and paralogy relationships at each duplicated locus, we show that 56% of ohnolog pairs show significantly asymmetric protein sequence evolution In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes.  The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication.	['2500']
53130a77e3eabad02100000f	Which hormone deficiency is implicated in the Costello syndrome ?	Measurements obtained after growth hormone exposure in 15 individuals were excluded in this analysis. Furthermore, we observed that RasGRF1 becomes phosphorylated in ARMS after stimulation by several pro-metastatic factors, such as SDF-1 and HGF/SF, as well as after exposure to growth-promoting Igf-2 and insulin. Progressively worsening hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a child with newly diagnosed Costello syndrome while receiving growth hormone therapy. This report highlights two important concepts: the association of genetic syndromes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the possibility of worsening severity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy linked to growth hormone therapy. Oncogenic HRAS mutations cause prolonged PI3K signaling in response to epidermal growth factor in fibroblasts of patients with Costello syndrome. Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of patients with BRAF and MEK1 mutations reported here, for polyhydramnios, growth hormone deficiency and the presence of more than one papilloma, which were less common in CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients.  Endocrine abnormalities including growth hormone deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, glucose intolerance, parathyroid adenoma with hyperprolactinemia and hypoglycemia have been described. Hypoglycemia has been documented due to growth hormone and cortisol deficiency.  Endocrine problems in this series were osteoporosis, central hypogonadism, and delayed puberty. Growth hormone deficiency in Costello syndrome. We report on three patients with Costello syndrome and isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency treated with biosynthetic GH. To our knowledge, these are the only patients with Costello syndrome who have been successfully treated for GH deficiency. We review the pathophysiology of Costello syndrome and highlight the recent recommendations of tumor screening and cardiac surveillance in this population, of particular relevance to those receiving GH therapy. Costello syndrome with growth hormone deficiency and hypoglycemia: a new report and review of the endocrine associations. We describe an 18-month-old boy with Costello syndrome (CS) with proven partial growth hormone (GH) deficiency and hypoglycemic episodes. The hypoglycemia is deemed to be due to cortisol deficiency. This report represents the second published case of cortisol deficiency in the CS. We present the case of a boy with Costello syndrome who developed osteofibrous dysplasia during a phase of growth hormone therapy. Thus, although osteofibrous dysplasia in Costello syndrome has not been reported before, growth hormone therapy should be used under close supervision in children with this syndrome.

56c1f040ef6e394741000055	Which antibodies cause Riedel thyroiditis?	LEARNING POINTS: There are potential clinical applications of identifying subsets of patients with IgG4 thyroiditis (FVHT and Riedel thyroiditis). The importance of IgG4 in the predictive model of thyroiditis. Increased lymphangiogenesis in Riedel thyroiditis (Immunoglobulin G4-related thyroid disease). The present study describes in depth a case of Riedel thyroiditis (RT) to clarify its pathogenesis and its putative inclusion in the spectrum of IgG4-related disease.  Our findings support the inclusion of RT within the spectrum of IgG4-related thyroid disease (IgG4-RTD). Although the etiology and physiopathology of IgG4-RTD still remain elusive, the results obtained in the present case suggest the participation of lymphatic vessels in the pathogenesis of RT. More than 80 % of the left thyroid lobe was effaced by fibrosis and inflammation (lymphocytes, 57 IgG4+ plasma cells per 1 high-power field, an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.67, and eosinophils) with extension into the surrounding tissues and occlusive phlebitis.  Diagnosed early as Riedel disease, the high serum IgG4, immunohistopathology and decreased fibrosis with corticosteroid therapy, finally confirm for the first time, the origin of IgG4-RSD fibrosis of the thyroid.  While IgG4-RSD is well documented in the pancreas and other organs, it is poorly characterized in the thyroid gland.  He was careful to distinguish this from Riedel thyroiditis but it has become clear that fibrosis and atrophy of the thyroid are indeed components of Hashimoto thyroiditis, and in rare cases IgG4-related sclerosing disease may be an outcome.  The relationship between HT and Riedel thyroiditis remains unclear; however, recent evidence seems to suggest that it may also be part of the spectrum of Ig4-related sclerosing disease.   One patient with advanced thyroid fibrosis associated with Riedel thyroiditis and a history of disease in multiple other organ systems did not have improvement in the thyroid gland, but the disease did not progress to involve new organs.  IgG4RD may be present in a certain proportion of patients with a wide variety of diseases, including Mikulicz's disease, autoimmune pancreatitis, hypophysitis, Riedel thyroiditis, interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, prostatitis, lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal fibrosis, inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory pseudotumor.

55475dc2f35db75526000001	Which is the most known bacterium responsible for botulism (sausage-poisoning)?	Botulism is a serious foodborne neuroparalytic disease, caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Cattle botulism is a fatal intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D Botulism in horses in the USA is attributed to Clostridium botulinum types A, B or C. Clostridium botulinum is the etiological agent of botulism. Due to food-borne poisoning and the potential use of the extremely toxic botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) from C. botulinum Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is one of the most dangerous toxin in the world. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease that can occur in all warm-blooded animals, birds, and fishes. The disease in animals is mainly caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum strains belonging to group III, although outbreaks due to toxins produced by group I and II organisms have been recognized. Botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, all warm-blooded animals, and some fishes. The disease is caused by exposure to toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by different strains of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum are responsible for the disease botulism and include a group of immunologically distinct serotypes (A, B, E, and F) that are considered to be the most lethal natural proteins known for humans. Botulinumtoxin (BTX) is a neurotoxin produced from Clostridium botulinum under anaerobic conditions and is responsible for botulism, a notifiable, bacterial form of food poisoning. Botulism is a disease characterized by neuromuscular paralysis and is produced from botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) found within the Gram positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum. An epidemiological investigation and laboratory detection studies showed that sausage contaminated by type A Clostridium botulinum caused this outbreak of food poisoning.

Seroprevalence in animal species were: goats (66.8%), cattle (28.2%), dogs (7.4%), pigs (4.7%), chickens (1.2%), geese (1.7%), rodents (4.4%) and hedgehogs (2.7%). The possibility that SFTSV transmission may occur by both the transstadial and transovarial routes was suggested by the fact that viral RNA was detected in H. longicornis at all developmental stages. Tick-derived sequences shared over 95.6% identity with human- and animal-derived isolates. This study provides evidence that implicates ticks as not only vectors but also, reservoirs of SFTSV. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new emerging zoonosis. A survey of reptile-associated ticks and their infection status with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus was conducted to determine the relative abundance and distribution among lizards, skinks, and snakes in the Republic of Korea (ROK). In total, 84 ixodid ticks belonging to two genera (Ixodes and Amblyomma) were collected from 28/132 (21.2%) lizards, skinks, and snakes. These results implicate lizards and snakes as potential hosts of SFTS virus.

51405cd123fec90375000005	Which is the defective protein causing the lysosomal storage disease Fabry?	The lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease is characterized by excessive globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in major organs such as the heart and kidney. Defective lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (Gla) is responsible for excessive Gb3 accumulation, and one cell sensitive to the effects of Gb3 accumulation is vascular endothelium. Anderson-Fabry disease (referred to as Fabry disease) is an X-linked disorder characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A and the subsequent accumulation in various tissues of globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)), the main substrate of the defective enzyme. Human alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22; alpha-Gal A) is the lysosomal exoglycosidase responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-galactosyl residues from glycoconjugates and is the defective enzyme causing Fabry disease (McKusick 301500).

58af16ea717cd3f655000002	What happens to H2AX upon DNA bouble strand breaks?	Histone H2AX phosphorylation as a measure of DNA double-strand breaks and a marker of environmental stress and disease activity in lupus DSBs were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets from patients with SLE, healthy controls, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by measuring phosphorylated H2AX (phospho-H2AX) levels with flow cytometry Most hydrogen peroxide-induced histone H2AX phosphorylation is mediated by ATR and is not dependent on DNA double-strand breaks. The nuclear foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) are frequently used as a marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) following ionizing radiation (IR) These results suggest that a major fraction of γH2AX induced by oxidative stress is not associated with DSBs. Single-stranded DNA arisen from stalled replication forks can cause the ATR-mediated induction of γH2AX H2AX phosphorylation at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks in cultivated mammalian cells and tissues A sequence variant of histone H2A called H2AX is one of the key components of chromatin involved in DNA damage response induced by different genotoxic stresses  Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) is rapidly concentrated in chromatin domains around DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) after the action of ionizing radiation or chemical agents and at stalled replication forks during replication stress DNA double-strand breaks in heterochromatin elicit fast repair protein recruitment, histone H2AX phosphorylation and relocation to euchromatin he cellular response to DSBs depends on damage signaling including the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX (γH2AX). However, a lack of γH2AX formation in heterochromatin (HC) is generally observed after DNA damage induction. Here, we examine γH2AX and repair protein foci along linear ion tracks traversing heterochromatic regions in human or murine cells and find the DSBs and damage signal streaks bending around highly compacted DNA.

5313058de3eabad02100000e	Abnormality in which vertebral region is important in the Bertolotti's syndrome?	Bertolotti's syndrome (BS), a form of lumbago in lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, is an important cause of low back pain in young patients.   Common causes of back pain were the ipsilateral L5-S1 facet joint, neoarticulation, the SI joint, and disc degeneration.  Patients with Bertolotti's syndrome have characteristic lumbosacral anomalies and often have severe sciatica.  We suggest that the intractable sciatica in this syndrome could arise from impingement of the nerve root extraforaminally by compression caused by the enlarged transverse process. Radiofrequency sensory ablation as a treatment for symptomatic unilateral lumbosacral junction pseudarticulation (Bertolotti's syndrome): a case report. She was found to have an elongated right L5 transverse process that articulated with the sacral ala (Bertolotti's syndrome). Lumbosacral transitional vertebra is an anatomical variation of the fifth lumbar vertebra in which an enlarged transverse process can form a joint or fusion with the sacrum or ilium. The association of that variant with low back pain and the change in the biomechanical properties of the lumbar spine is called Bertolotti's syndrome.  Radiographic investigation revealed an anomalous enlargement of the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra forming a pseudarthrosis with the infrajacent ala of the sacrum.  Transitional lumbosacral vertebrae and low back pain: diagnostic pitfalls and management of Bertolotti's syndrome.  Bertolotti's syndrome is a spine disorder characterized by the occurrence of a congenital lumbar transverse mega-apophysis in a transitional vertebral body that usually articulates with the sacrum or the iliac bone.  It is characterized by an enlarged transverse process at the most caudal lumbar vertebra with a pseudoarticulation of the transverse process and the sacral ala.  Bertolotti's syndrome is characterised by anomalous enlargement of the transverse process(es) of the most caudal lumbar vertebra which may articulate or fuse with the sacrum or ilium and cause isolated L4/5 disc disease.

The locations of DAVFs were the transverse-sigmoid sinus in 11, tentorium in 10, cranial vault in 9, and superior sagittal sinus, jugular bulb, foramen magnum, and middle cranial fossa in 1 each. Borden classification was type I in 7, type II in 3, and type III in 24. Transarterial glue embolization is highly effective for Borden type III DAVF with direct cortical venous drainage, but has limitations for Borden type I and II DAVFs in which the affected sinus is part of the normal venous circulation. The results of subtype (Borden and Cognard classification), venous reflux and fistula sites were also accurately exhibited in 4D-CTA. The commonly used Borden and Cognard classification systems for the prediction of clinical behavior of cranial dural arteriovenous shunts focus on the venous drainage, particularly the presence of leptomeningeal venous drainage, and on the direction of flow, particularly the presence of retrograde flow.  The CS DAVFs and the NCS DAVFs were categorized using the Barrow and Borden classification systems, respectively.  The two most commonly used and clinically accepted DAVF classifications are the Merland-Cognard classification and the Borden classification, both based on the morphology of the venous drainage. When analyzed according to the Borden classification, none (0%) of 55 Type I intracranial dural AVFs, two (11%) of 18 Type II, and 14 (48%) of 29 Type III intracranial dural AVFs presented with hemorrhage (p < 0.0001).

CEP family protein is the active component of centrosome Cep135/Bld10 is a conserved centriolar protein required for the formation of the central cartwheel, an early intermediate in centriole assembly. Thus, in flies, Cep135/Bld10 is not essential for cartwheel assembly or for establishing the ninefold symmetry of centrioles; rather, it appears to stabilize the connection between inner and outer centriole components. Cep135 is a 135-kDa, coiled-coil centrosome protein important for microtubule organization in mammalian cells 135 kDa centrosomal protein (CEP135) In the present study, we investigated a novel interaction between CEP135 and C-NAP1, two core centriolar proteins. Drosophila Bld10, the ortholog of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Bld10p and human Cep135, is a ubiquitous centriolar protein that also localizes to the spermatid basal body. M BLD10/CEP135 is a microtubule-associated protein that controls the formation of the flagellum central microtubule pair. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS6, SAS4/CPAP and BLD10/CEP135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. pericentriolar material proteins including pericentrin and CEP135. hereas Cep135 and CPAP formed a core structure within the proximal lumen of both parental and nascent centrioles .

56cafa845795f9a73e00002e	Which protein pathway is regulating SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a to control cell proliferation?	The mTOR pathway controls cell proliferation by regulating the FoxO3a transcription factor via SGK1 kinase the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314 These results suggest that mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314 SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation.

This was initially treated with analgesia, caffeine, and fluids for the presumed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak she was treated for CSF leak using an epidural blood patch. Epidural blood patching may be necessary to seal the leak - CT fluoroscopy may be helpful in delivering the patch directly to the site of the leak  invasive measures with epidural blood patch providing the cornerstone of the invasive measures However the present results, allows us to conclude that EBP in treatment-refractory low CSF pressure headache can be considered as a treatment option. In high-risk patients , for example, age < 50 years, postpartum, large-gauge needle puncture, epidural blood patch should be performed Both parturients were successfully managed using acupuncture rather than an epidural blood patch. The weight of existing literature supports EBP as an initial treatment of SIH, although its effectiveness does not approach that seen when EBP is used to treat meningeal puncture headache. In this case, a 17-yr-old girl had symptoms of a low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement alleviated by an epidural blood patch.

51542e44d24251bc05000081	Mutations in which gene determine response to both erlotinib and gefitinib?	Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are frequently observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have transformed therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and have proved superior to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for this patient group. Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are promising therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs. NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases. Patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and active EGFR mutation have a high response rate (60-70%) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with little immediate progression (primary resistance). Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. EGFR-TKI yields a long survival period in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with EGFR gene mutations, Efficacy of erlotinib was recognized in the cases in which disease control was obtained by initial treatment with gefitinib. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who carry epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations respond remarkably well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib, or erlotinib. lung adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib; The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated treatments with these drugs. These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to other EGFR-TKIs. The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this seemed to be the cause of drug resistance. Patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma exhibiting overexpression or mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor tend to respond better to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with adenocarcinoma and never smokers. Some common somatic mutations in EGFR, including deletion mutations in exon 19 and leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 858 (L858R) in exon 21, have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib, which are selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in lung adenocarcinomas that respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)(such as gefitinib or erlotinib)treatment of lung cancer harboring EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies. patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations who received CSF examinations during epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment (250 mg daily gefitinib or 150 mg daily erlotinib). The evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as gefitinib and erlotinib was first confirmed as the second-line treatment for non-selective patients with advanced NSCLC. patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, the first-line treatment with gefitinib had achieved a significant prolongation of progression-free survival compared with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in a few phase III trials, and became a new standard of care. Gefitinib is highly effective for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation even if their performance status is poor, although one should always pay careful attention to fatal interstitial lung disease. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), which are molecularly targeted drugs, and it has now become possible to select treatment methods by choosing from a number of anticancer drugs. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to have a very high cytoreductive effect on lung cancers that have EGFR gene mutations. EGFR gene mutations at kinase domain in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers led to development of the small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been found in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with good clinical response to gefitinib therapy. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.

In this study, we assessed the feasibility of fetal RhD genotyping by analysis of cell-free fetal DNA(cffDNA) extracted from plasma samples of Rhesus (Rh) D-negative pregnant women by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Performing real-time PCR on cffDNA showed accurate, efficient and reliable results, allowing rapid and high throughput non invasive determination of fetal sex and RhD status in clinical samples Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal RhD by using free fetal DNA The aim of this study is to determine fetal RhD status in the Rh incompatible pregnancies with an non-invasive technique; free fetal DNA isolation from maternal circulation.  The detection of fetal RhD status by using a non-invasive method from maternal circulation was found to be possible. Assessing fetal RhD status non-invasively by using free fetal DNA in maternal blood will be cost-efficient, avoiding unnecessary indirect Coombs test and unnecessary Rhogam applications that is used in RH incompatible pregnancies. Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection. Non-invasive antenatal diagnosis of fetal rhesus status in an alloimmunised patient. Our subsequent investigations have shown that this elevation in fetal cell traffic may serve as an early marker for those pregnancies at risk for this disorder.A very recent exciting discovery has been that free extracellular fetal DNA can be detected in the plasma and serum of pregnant women, which may permit the rapid and accurate detection of uniquely fetal loci, such as the fetal rhesus D gene in rhesus D negative pregnant women. Fetal rhesus D (RhD) status determination using circulating cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma or serum is now recognized in Europe as a reliable and useful tool. NGS is now sufficiently sensitive to analyze circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood (cell-free fetal DNA, cffDNA), enabling applications such as non invasive diagnosis of fetal sex (and X-linked diseases), fetal rhesus among rhesus-negative women, trisomy and, in the near future, Mendelian mutations High throughput non-invasive determination of foetal Rhesus D status using automated extraction of cell-free foetal DNA in maternal plasma and mass spectrometry Non-invasive RNA-based determination of fetal Rhesus D type: a prospective study based on 96 pregnancies. BACKGROUND: Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders.  Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.  Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing by analysis of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is a rapidly evolving field.

Lately the development of 3 novel second-generation androgen receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) chanced the treatment landscape of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  CONCLUSION: Our outcomes support equivalent efficacy and similar risk of adverse effects between apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide, supporting the use of these antiandrogen agents in high-risk of progression nmCRPC. Furthermore, the combination of BAY 1895344 with the novel, nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist darolutamide resulted in significantly improved antitumor efficacy compared with respective single-agent treatments in hormone-dependent prostate cancer, and addition of EBRT resulted in even further enhanced antitumor efficacy.  The antiandrogen therapeutics apalutamide and darolutamide entered the clinic in 2018 and 2019, respectively, for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  This has been further verified by the recent FDA approval of the other two second-generation AR antagonists, apalutamide and darolutamide, for the treatment of prostate cancer.  The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer.  BACKGROUND: Darolutamide is recently approved for the treatment of non-metastatic castrate resistance prostate cancer.  Multiple agents including abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T have been approved for advanced prostate cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: NSAAs improve survival in high-risk nmCRPC. Apalutamide and enzalutamide may result in improved oncologic outcomes. Darolutamide may result in fewer AEs. Phase IV data are needed to validate these findings. Darolutamide for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Budget impact analysis of darolutamide for treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist with a distinct molecular structure, significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival versus placebo in the phase III ARAMIS study in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). BACKGROUND: Darolutamide is a structurally distinct androgen-receptor inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide in Nonmetastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, an oral androgen receptor inhibitor, has been approved for treating nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), based on significant improvements in metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the ARAMIS clinical t Based on positive results in the phase III ARAMIS trial, darolutamide was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we evaluate the activity of darolutamide in enzalutamide-resistant castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as well as in AR mutants detected in patients after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide. BACKGROUND: Darolutamide, a structurally distinct androgen receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), has been shown to increase metastasis-free survival among men with nmCRPC compared with placebo. For non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, recent phase III placebo-controlled trials with enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide all demonstrated benefits in improving metastasis-free survival.

Comparative efficacy of apalutamide darolutamide and enzalutamide for treatment of non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Studies using apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide have shown improved metastasis free survival (MFS) rates, leaving clinicians with a dilemma of choosing one over the other, for nonmetastatic castration recurrent prostate cancer (nmCRPC). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Darolutamide is a novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonist approved for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  Apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Apalutamide and enzalutamide appear to be more efficacious agents for therapy of nmCRPC, while darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile.  Darolutamide: A Review in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.  In the pivotal multinational, phase 3 ARAMIS trial in men with nmCRPC, relative to placebo plus ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), darolutamide (+ ADT) significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival (MFS) at the time of the primary analysis and overall survival (OS) at the time of the final OS analysis and was generally well tolerated in extended follow-up.  The phase III ARAMIS study shows that the androgen-receptor antagonist darolutamide delays metastasis in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer by a median of 22 months compared with a placebo. Since 2018, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide have been approved for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC). Apalutamide, enzalutamide, and most recently, darolutamide (novel androgen receptor antagonists) have been approved for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).

56ed27202ac5ed145900000c	In which cells are A-type lamins expressed?	Antibodies specific for mouse A/C lamins, human A/C lamins, or B lamins have been used to define the lamin complement as a function of time in culture and of cell type.  dramatic increase in lamin A/C-positive cells was observed in the first 3 days of culture with both accessory cells and macrophages expressing lamins A/C as soon as such cell types could be identified. Parallel in vivo experiments showed that treatment with thioglycollate caused the percentage of lamin A/C-positive peritoneal macrophages to increase from 5 to 80% between Days 0 and 6. Early embryonic cells and stem cells of mammals generally possess only lamin B while lamins A and C appear later during differentiation.  Northern analysis and immunoblotting demonstrated that lamin A/C mRNA and protein were not detectable in some human cell lines whereas lamin B1 was always present In the rat brain, lamin A and C are expressed in relatively equal amounts, while the expressions of lamin B1 and B2 vary depending on the cell type. Hemopoietic cells from blood and bone marrow of mammals usually do not express lamins A/C but only lamin B, and this feature distinguishes these cells from the vast majority of somatic cells of the adult animal, which reveal lamins A/C as well as lamin B These results demonstrated that EC cells devoid of lamins A and C nevertheless possessed the appropriate mechanisms for the localization and mitotic redistribution of exogenous lamins A and C. Spermatogonia and seminoma cells, which follow a differentiation pathway along the spermatogenic lineage and show characteristics of germ cells, do not express A-type lamins. While B-type lamins are expressed in almost all cell types, no A-type lamins are present in early vertebrate embryos or undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines. B-type lamins are present in almost all cell types, but A-type lamins are expressed predominantly in differentiated cells, suggesting a role in maintenance of the differentiated state. The expression of A-type lamins coincides with cell differentiation and as A-type lamins specifically interact with chromatin, a role in the regulation of differential gene expression has been suggested for A-type lamins. In the literature it is conveyed that only B-type lamins are required in these early stages of development and that A-type lamins are not present or required until differentiation of specific cell types associated with specialized tissue is initiated. B-type lamins are present in almost all cell types, but A-type lamins are expressed predominantly in differentiated cells, suggesting a role in maintenance of the differentiated state The nuclear lamina is a meshwork of intermediate filaments adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane that in mammalian cells is predominantly composed of three proteins: lamin A, lamin B, and lamin C. Because lamin A and C (A-type lamins) expression has been shown to be lacking in several types of undifferentiated or rapidly proliferating cells, we investigated lamin expression in the human liver in conditions with hepatocellular regeneration (cirrhosis of various etiologies and macroregenerative nodules) and in hepatocellular carcinomas of various grades of differentiation Our results identify the absence of A-type lamin expression as a novel marker for undifferentiated ES cells and further support a role for nuclear lamins in cell maintenance and differentiation In an attempt to provide an additional meaning to lamin-genome contacts, a recent study characterized the association of gene promoters with A-type lamins in progenitor and differentiated cells Previous studies have shown that lamin A/C is not expressed during mouse development before day 9, nor in undifferentiated mouse embryonic carcinoma cells.  Ectopic expression of an A-type lamin does not interfere with differentiation of lamin A-negative embryonal carcinoma cells. Intriguingly, expression of A-type lamins occurs concomitant with cell differentiation and embryonic development.  While B-type lamins are expressed in almost all cell types, no A-type lamins are present in early vertebrate embryos or undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell lines.

Here we show the full domain architecture of human TMEM132 family proteins solved using in-depth sequence and structural analysis. We reveal them to be five previously unappreciated cell adhesion molecules whose domain architecture has an early holozoan origin prior to the emergence of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals. These findings strongly predict a cellular adhesion function for TMEM132 family, connecting the extracellular medium with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton.

55411d9f379ddf3f47000001	Which is the most typical peptide sequence responsible for retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal proteins from the Golgi apparatus?	Retention of soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent on their interaction with the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor in the Golgi apparatus and their subsequent retrieval back to the endoplasmic reticulum. the retrieval system for lumenal ER proteins. These proteins carry a specific sorting signal, typically the tetrapeptide KDEL, which is bound by a receptor in the Golgi apparatus. The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s) the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack retrieval of KDEL-containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway The erd2 protein is the receptor responsible for recycling proteins bearing the carboxyl-terminal sequence KDEL (single-letter amino acid code) to the endoplasmic reticulum, following their loss from that organelle by the process of forward transport	['the carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL)']
5c73acef7c78d69471000088	Which receptor is targeted by Erenumab?	Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling are being explored as prophylactic treatments for migraine. Erenumab (AMG 334) is the first potent, selective, and competitive human mAb antagonist of the CGRP receptor.  Erratum: Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor as a novel target for the management of people with episodic migraine: current evidence and safety profile of erenumab [Corrigendum]. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab).  Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab).  Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor as a novel target for the management of people with episodic migraine: current evidence and safety profile of erenumab. Erenumab is the only mAb that targets the CGRP receptor instead of the ligand, with high specificity and affinity of binding. BACKGROUND We tested erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, for the prevention of episodic migraine. We assessed the efficacy and safety of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the CGRP receptor, in patients with chronic migraine. Erenumab is a novel CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). Erenumab (AMG 334) is the first potent, selective, and competitive human mAb antagonist of the CGRP receptor. OBJECTIVE To assess long-term safety and efficacy of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor erenumab in patients with episodic migraine (EM). CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks. Currently, 4 monoclonal antibodies targeting either the CGRP ligand or receptor are being studied for migraine prevention: ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG 334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab), and TEV-48125 (fremanezumab). Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine. OBJECTIVE To determine the potential impact of erenumab, a human anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, on total exercise time (TET), time to exercise-induced angina, and ST depression in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with stable angina due to documented coronary artery disease. Background We evaluated the effect of erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, on migraine-related disability, impact, and health-related quality of life among patients with episodic migraine. METHODS Thirteen migraine patients, previously enrolled in erenumab anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody trials, received CGRP in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design to investigate their susceptibility to migraine induction. Currently, 4 monoclonal antibodies targeting either the CGRP ligand or receptor are being studied for migraine prevention: ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG 334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab), and TEV-48125 (fremanezumab).  Erenumab did not adversely affect exercise time in a high cardiovascular risk population of patients, supporting that inhibition of the canonical CGRP receptor does not worsen myocardial ischemia.

54fc99f36ad7dcbc12000004	Neurostimulation of which nucleus is used for treatment of dystonia?	Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS was performed in five SD patients and unilateral ventralis oralis anterior and posterior (Voa/Vop) nucleus of the thalamus DBS in two post-stroke hemiballismus patients.  BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum (GPi-DBS) is effective for various types of drug-refractory primary dystonias.  METHODS: In the parent trial, 40 patients were randomly assigned to either sham neurostimulation or neurostimulation of the internal globus pallidus for a period of 3 months and thereafter all patients completed 6 months of active neurostimulation. 38 patients agreed to be followed up annually after the activation of neurostimulation, including assessments of dystonia severity, pain, disability, and quality of life. INTERPRETATION: 3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia. This long-term observation provides further evidence in favour of pallidal neurostimulation as a first-line treatment for patients with medically intractable, segmental, or generalised dystonia. We describe a patient who received bilateral globus pallidus internus DBS for dystonia with initially good clinical response, but the device eventually failed.  Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis cerebral palsy: a prospective pilot study. Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown.  INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP.  Pallidal deep-brain stimulation in primary generalized or segmental dystonia. BACKGROUND: Neurostimulation of the internal globus pallidus has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of primary dystonia.  CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation for 3 months was more effective than sham stimulation in patients with primary generalized or segmental dystonia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) on mood and cognitive performance in patients with dystonia before surgery (at baseline, while patients received their usual treatment) and 12 months postoperatively (while patients received neurostimulation and their medications) in a multicenter prospective study.  CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal stimulation has a good benefit-to-risk ratio as it did not negatively affect cognitive performance and mood in primary dystonia, while a significant motor improvement was obtained. Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes.  Bilateral deep-brain stimulation of the globus pallidus in primary generalized dystonia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, controlled, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 22 patients with primary generalized dystonia.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the efficacy and safety of the use of bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in selected patients with primary generalized dystonia. Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients. This suggests that neurostimulation of the VIM may be an effective treatment for myoclonus in pharmacologically intractable IMDS. We report on the effects of bilateral neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) in a patient with medically intractable and progressing inherited myoclonus dystonia syndrome (IMDS).  Neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus in inherited myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. Pallidal and thalamic neurostimulation in severe tardive dystonia. After informed consent, a bilateral stereotactic electrode placement targeting the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) was performed. Stimulation of the VIM did not improve the hyperkinetic movements and simultaneous stimulation of both the GPi and the VIM did not result in any additional benefit.  Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. 3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia.

5171438a8ed59a060a000007	What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?	Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S). In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i.e. MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T). RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCR Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The germline mutation was detected because of the systematic genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, which is useful for genetic counseling of potential risk of HSCR and MTC in other family members. This family could be added to the small worldwide cohort of families with MEN2A/FMTC-HSCR. Germline mutations of the ret protooncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and a proportion of cases of HSCR. In this report, we describe a new kindred in which the MEN2 and HSCR phenotypes are associated with a single C620S point mutation at one of the cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the ret protooncogene. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene.	['Ret']

554356d0ed966d112c000005	Which is the most common measure of differences between dinucleotide relative abundance "genomic signatures"	The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signature', the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs) The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows on a given genome. The profile is computed from the base step "odds ratios" that compare dinucleotide frequencies to those expected under the assumption of stochastic equilibrium (thorough shuffling). The genome signatures (dinucleotide relative abundance values) the set of dinucleotide biases constitutes a 'genomic signature' that can discriminate sequences from different organisms. the set of dinucleotide odds ratio (relative abundance) values constitute a signature of each DNA genome, which can discriminate between sequences from different organisms. Genomic homogeneity is investigated for a broad base of DNA sequences in terms of dinucleotide relative abundance distances (abbreviated delta-distances) delta-distances between different genomic sequences in the same species are low, only about 2 or 3 times the distance found in random DNA, and are generally smaller than the between-species delta-distances the set of dinucleotide odds ratios or 'general design' is a remarkably stable property of the DNA of an organism The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signature', between bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. The dinucleotide relative abundance profile can be regarded as a genomic signature because, despite diversity between species, it varies little between 50 kilobase or longer windows on a given genome. The correlation between the genomic signature and DNA-DNA hybridisation values was high and taxa that showed less than 30% DNA-DNA binding will in general not have dinucleotide relative abundance dissimilarity (delta*) values below 40. Previously, the concept of a genomic signature was introduced with the observation of species-type specific Dinucleotide Relative Abundance Profiles (DRAPs); dinucleotides were identified as the subsequences with the greatest bias in representation in a majority of genomes. Comparisons within and between species sample sequences are based on the profile of dinucleotide relative abundance values (The profile is rho*XY = f*XY/f*Xf*Y for all XY, where f*X denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and f*XY denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complement). The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or genomic signature, between bacterial chromosomes and plasmids.

The PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was well tolerated in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) is a humanised anti-programmed death-1 (anti PD-1) antibody. Decitabine plus camrelizumab may reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Addition of Low-Dose Decitabine to Anti-PD-1 Antibody Camrelizumab in Relapsed/Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. CONCLUSION CR rate in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were clinically naïve to PD-1 blockade was significantly higher with decitabine plus camrelizumab than with camrelizumab alone. As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. Recent phase 1-2 trials reported manageable safety profiles and promising antitumor activities of anti-PD-1 drugs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab and JS001) with/without chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC), however head-to-head comparison among these regimens is lacking.

Lactate dehydrogenase and baseline markers associated with clinical outcomes of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with camrelizumab (SHR-1210), a novel anti-PD-1 antibody. All patients were administered intravenous camrelizumab (SHR-1210), a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, at doses of 60 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg (4-week interval after first dose followed by a 2-week schedule) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Here we describe a case of a novel pattern of RRP induced by anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab 2 years after radiotherapy, with some focus on further understanding of this phenomenon.  After 15 months, due to tumor progression and brain metastasis, he started with administration of anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab (200 mg q2w) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).  We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients. This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In our present report, we described a newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer patient who suffered from focal vitiligo for approximately ten years and was treated with the anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor antibody camrelizumab (SHR-1210), which accelerated the aggravation of depigmentation of the skin over the whole body in just half a year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, phase II study, the safety and efficacy of combined regimen of chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GVD) plus anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was assessed in rrPMBCL.  Apatinib plus camrelizumab (anti-PD1 therapy, SHR-1210) for advanced osteosarcoma (APFAO) progressing after chemotherapy: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial. We further benchmarked the dissociation kinetics for three clinically approved PD-1 blockade mAbs (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Camrelizumab), intriguingly correlating well with the objective response rates in the hepatocellular carcinoma second-line treatment. Purpose: Camrelizumab inhibits PD-1 in non-clinical models and showed typical non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles for an IgG4 monoclonal antibody.  Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor. sions: Our findings suggest that (I) PD-1 targeted immunotherapy with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab yielded a promising outcome in Chinese HBV patients with HCC and that (II) immunotherapy was well tolerated generally and had manageable side effects.

Ca INTRODUCTION: Camrelizumab (also known as SHR-1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has been shown to block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and consequently inhibit the immune escape of tumor cells The structure of the camrelizumab/PD-1 complex reveals that camrelizumab mainly utilizes its heavy chain to bind to PD-1, while the light chain sterically inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1. Here, we demonstrate varied N-glycan composition in PD-1, and show that the binding affinity of camrelizumab, a recently approved PD-1-specific MAb, to non-glycosylated PD-1 proteins from E. coli is substantially decreased compared with glycosylated PD-1. This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.M INTRODUCTION: Camrelizumab (also known as SHR-1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has been shown to block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and consequently inhibit the immune escape o Purpose: Camrelizumab inhibits PD-1 in non-clinical models and showed typical non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles for an IgG4 monoclonal  Camrelizumab (AiRuiKa™), a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor being developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd, recently received conditional approval in China for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib had efficacy in a phase II trial. PURPOSE: We assessed the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) plus apatinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGFR]-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, all three patients responded to low-dose decitabine, an epigenetic drug, in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), with only controllable adverse events, indicating that low-dose decitabine can sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Background: Camrelizumab is a promising anti-programmed cell death-1 agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and induces reactive capillary hemangiomas (RCHs).  Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor; however, current evidence of its efficacy in PSC is lacking. Camrelizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor originally developed in China for the treatment of refractory lymphoma.  Recent phase 1-2 trials reported manageable safety profiles and promising antitumor activities of anti-PD-1 drugs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab and JS001) with/without chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC), however head-to-head comparison among these regimens is lacking.  Camrelizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

531a3a58b166e2b806000037	To what extent does HPV vaccination reduce the risk for cervical cancer?	The success of HPV vaccination as a major public health prevention opportunity, however, will entirely depend on efficient infrastructures to deliver the vaccines and on the acceptance by individuals, parents and health care providers. The most effective strategy therein was vaccination of 12-year-olds, plus a temporary 12-24-year-old catch-up program covering both sexes; whereby HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, high-grade cervical precancer, and genital wart incidence was reduced by 84-98% during year 50 following vaccine introduction the introduction of cervical screening programs, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has been drastically reduced On the assumption that the vaccine provided lifelong immunity, the cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was $43,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, as compared with the current screening practice Vaccine efficacy in prevention of CIN 2 or higher lesions in HPV 16 or HPV 18 negative women, who received all vaccination doses, ranges between 98% and 100% Life expectancy gained from vaccination is 13.04 years and average Quality Adjusted Life Years saved (QALYs) is 24.4 in vaccinated vs 6.29 in unvaccinated Organized vaccination programs against HPV have the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancers and the vast majority of the other HPV-related conditions.  However, existing data strongly suggests that as many as 440,000 cervical cancer cases and 220,000 deaths due to this malignancy will be prevented with the establishment of an effective worldwide HPV immunization program Prophylactic HPV vaccination against HPV 16 and 18 has been shown to be highly effective in preventing HPV related malignancy in clinical trials Nevertheless women up to 45 years of age have been shown to exhibit strong immune responses to the bivalent HPV vaccine which might be expected to reduce the risk of HPV re-infection and address the second peak of HPV related malignancy in later life, evident over 45 years of age Reduced costs, simple vaccine regimes and strengthening vaccine delivery platforms for adolescents should eventually facilitate HPV vaccine introduction in developing countries. Besides cost, there are several socio-cultural and ethical issues involved with the implementation of already developed vaccines including the acceptability of HPV vaccination by preadolescent girls and their parents in India.

550e828c71445a662f000002	Which molecule is targeted by the drug Gevokizumab?	Detailed mechanistic analysis of gevokizumab, an allosteric anti-IL-1β antibody with differential receptor-modulating properties. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism.  These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases. Most recently, rising evidence reports on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab, while use of anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents (anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab), IL-6 blockers (tocilizumab), and rituximab (depleting anti-CD20 antibody) is also increasing. One target-two different binding modes: structural insights into gevokizumab and canakinumab interactions to interleukin-1β. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies.  Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1β bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1β signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1β.  In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1β and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechanisms of IL-1β pathway attenuation. Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody.  Interleukin-1β-regulating antibody XOMA 052 (gevokizumab) in the treatment of acute exacerbations of resistant uveitis of Behcet's disease: an open-label pilot study. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a recombinant humanised anti-interleukin 1β antibody, in Behçet's disease patients with uveitis.  Gevokizumab, an anti-IL-1β mAb for the potential treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. XOMA is developing gevokizumab (XOMA-052), an IgG2 humanized mAb against human IL-1β, for the potential treatment of these diseases. Gevokizumab has a high affinity for IL-1β and a long t1/2, which would allow for once-monthly dosing and offer a considerable advantage for patients over agents requiring more frequent dosing. To meet these challenges, we developed XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a potent anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody that was designed in silico and humanized using Human Engineering™ technology.  In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies. Gevokizumab is a novel, human-engineered monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody.

5e6399dd1af46fc13000000f	What cellular process is JAK/STAT involved in?	JAK/STAT signal pathway, a requisite part in the signaling process of growth factors and cytokines, has become attractive targets for numerous immune, inflammatory and hematopoietic diseases Role of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in regulation of innate immunity in neuroinflammatory diseases The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is utilized by numerous cytokines and interferons, and is essential for the development and function of both innate and adaptive immunity. Stimulation of the cholinergic inflammatory pathway can attenuate collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and inhibit synovitis by Janus kinase (JAK) 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signaling. Cytokines are key modulators of immunity. Most cytokines use the Janus kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway to promote gene transcriptional regulation, but their signals must be attenuated by multiple mechanisms Moreover , JAK/STAT signaling , especially via the IL-6/STAT3 axis , is believed to be involved in the transition of inflammatory lesions to tumors leading to colitis-associated cancer ( CAC The JAK/STAT cascade is a principal signal transduction pathway in cytokine and growth factor signaling, regulating various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway constitute the fulcrum in many vital cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and regulatory immune functions.

In addition to sampling H3 and H4 modification status, we show that the DPF cooperates with the MYST domain to promote H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, although not if H3K4 is trimethylated	['the double PHD finger domain']
6057c0cd94d57fd879000032	What impacts stability of genomic imprinting in mouse pluripotent stem cells?	A Susceptibility Locus on Chromosome 13 Profoundly Impacts the Stability of Genomic Imprinting in Mouse Pluripotent Stem Cells. Cultured pluripotent cells accumulate detrimental chromatin alterations, including DNA methylation changes at imprinted genes known as loss of imprinting (LOI). Although the occurrence of LOI is considered a stochastic phenomenon, here we document a genetic determinant that segregates mouse pluripotent cells into stable and unstable cell lines. Unstable lines exhibit hypermethylation at Dlk1-Dio3 and other imprinted loci, in addition to impaired developmental potential. Stimulation of demethylases by ascorbic acid prevents LOI and loss of developmental potential. Susceptibility to LOI greatly differs between commonly used mouse strains, which we use to map a causal region on chromosome 13 with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Our observations identify a strong genetic determinant of locus-specific chromatin abnormalities in pluripotent cells and provide a non-invasive way to suppress them.

5a6a3464b750ff4455000026	Which algorithm has been developed in order to improve multiple circular sequence alignment using refined sequences?	MARS: improving multiple circular sequence alignment using refined sequences. We present MARS, a new heuristic method for improving Multiple circular sequence Alignment using Refined Sequences. MARS was implemented in the C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences. Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results show, among others, that the average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA sequences is reduced by around 5% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence alignment is performed.

601c4b231cb411341a000020	Givosiran is used for treatment of which disease?	Cost savings with hemin versus givosiran for the treatment of patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).  In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria CONCLUSIONS: Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for all AIP patients and subpopulations.  New treatment options include givosiran (siRNA) to down-regulate ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1) and the messenger RNA of PBGD (PBGD mRNA) delivered to the liver cells of patients with AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. BACKGROUND: Induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1) gene expression and accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates result in neurovisceral attacks and disease manifestations in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, a rare inherited disease of heme biosynthesis. Givosiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1 synthesis.METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria. In part A of the trial, patients without recent porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly injections of givosiran in patients who had recurrent porphyria attacks resulted in mainly low-grade adverse events, reductions in induced ALAS1 mRNA levels, nearly normalized levels of the neurotoxic intermediates delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, and a lower attack rate than that observed with placebo.  In November 2019 givosiran became the second small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based drug to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, it has been developed for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a disorder characterized by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks. The clinical performance of givosiran revealed that suppression of ALAS1 by GalNac-decorated siRNAs represents an additional approach for the treatment of patients with AIP that manifests recurrent acute neurovisceral attacks. Phase 3 Trial of RNAi Therapeutic Givosiran for Acute Intermittent Porphyria. Givosiran is being developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). Givosiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid agent that was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). This technology has led to the approval of givosiran for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, and there are another seven conjugates in registrational review or phase 3 trials and at least another 21 conjugates at earlier stages of clinical development. In November 2019, givosiran was approved in the USA for the treatment of adults with AHP based on the positive results from the multinational, phase III ENVISION trial. In preliminary results, givosiran achieved clinical endpoints for AIP, reducing urinary ALA levels, and presented a safety profile that enabled further drug development. This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of subcutaneously (SC) administered givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common AHP type. Givosiran, another RNAi therapeutic, targeting 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, has been positively tested in acute intermittent porphyria in phase 1/2 and ongoing phase 3 trials.	['porphyria']

55192892622b194345000012	Which E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the interferon receptor type 1 (IFNAR1)?	IFNAR1 ubiquitination is facilitated by the βTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recruited to IFNAR1 upon its degron phosphorylation, which is induced by the ligand. Both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways converge on phosphorylation of Ser(535) within the IFNAR1 degron leading to recruitment of beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase and concomitant ubiquitination and degradation. The SCF(betaTrcp) (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box complex) E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation in cells can conjugate both types of chains in vitro.  Levels of IFNAR1 (regulated via degradation mediated by the betaTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase) and IFNalpha signaling were reduced in 1205Lu melanoma cell line that harbors activated BRAF and exhibits high levels of betaTrcp ubiquitin ligase. IFNalpha promotes the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser535, followed by recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, beta-TrCP2 (beta-transducin repeats-containing protein 2), ubiquitination of IFNAR1 and proteolysis.  Ubiquitination, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation of the IFNAR1 (interferon alpha receptor 1) subunit of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor is mediated by the SCFbeta-Trcp (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein beta transducin repeat-containing protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here we show that IFNAR1 interacts with the Homolog of Slimb (HOS) F-box protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and that this interaction is promoted by interferon alpha (IFNalpha). IFNAR1 is ubiquitinated by the Skp1-Cullin1-HOS-Roc1 (SCF(HOS)) ubiquitin ligase in vitro.

5a43a139966455904c000008	What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?	Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS).  Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. Genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation within individual DNA molecules. Importantly, NOMe-seq obtains DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same DNA molecule, giving the first genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq).  Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. To address this we used Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy profiles between normal and cancer cell line models of the breast and prostate. Here we describe the bioinformatic pipeline and methods that we developed for the processing and analysis of the NOMe-seq data published by (Taberlay et al., 2014 [1]) and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession GSE57498. The NOMe-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements. TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Finally, these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively. Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq). Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules. We develop a statistical method, epiG, to infer and differentiate between different epi-allelic haplotypes, annotated with CpG methylation status and DNA polymorphisms, from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and nucleosome occupancy from NOMe-seq data. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients.

5a871b8d61bb38fb2400000a	What body process does the Dentate Gyrus Mossy Cell control?	We propose that this aberrant activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity, which lastingly impairs the information processing of cortical inputs in dentate gyrus, may participate in hippocampal-related cognitive deficits, such as those reported in patients with epilepsy Within the hippocampal formation neuronal networks undergo major reorganization, including the sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus; they establish aberrant recurrent synapses between dentate granule cells and operate via postsynaptic kainate receptors.  The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolism‑associated genes in recurrent neonatal seizure‑induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis Mossy cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus constitute a major excitatory principal cell type in the mammalian hippocampus; however, it remains unknown how these cells behave in vivo. Here, we have used two-photon Ca2+imaging to monitor the activity of mossy cells in awake, behaving mice. We find that mossy cells are significantly more active than dentate granule cells in vivo, exhibit spatial tuning during head-fixed spatial navigation, and undergo robust remapping of their spatial representations in response to contextual manipulation. Our results provide a functional characterization of mossy cells in the behaving animal and demonstrate their active participation in spatial coding and contextual representation. Recent experimental and modeling results demonstrated that surviving mossy cells in the dentate gyrus play key roles in the generation of network hyperexcitability. Mossy cells give rise to the commissural and associational pathway of the dentate gyrus, and receive their major excitatory inputs from the mossy fibers of granule cells. Through these feed-back excitatory connections, mossy cells have been suggested to play important roles in both normal signal processing in learning and memory, as well as in seizure propagation. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are thought to be essential to memory function by decorrelating overlapping input patterns (pattern separation). A second excitatory cell type in the dentate gyrus, the mossy cell, forms an intricate circuit with granule cells, CA3c pyramidal cells, and local interneurons, but the influence of mossy cells on dentate function is often overlooked.

Loss-of-function nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans. The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort.METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. CONCLUSION We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

5547a01cf35db75526000005	In which kingdom do microsporidia belong, according to their current classification scheme?	Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites. Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi.  Microsporidia are ubiquitous fungi with genomes that have undergone a strong reduction Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites.  Phylogenomics supports microsporidia as the earliest diverging clade of sequenced fungi. A combined analysis of thousands of gene trees supports a topology in which microsporidia is a sister group to all other sequenced fungi. Altogether, our data strongly support a scenario in which microsporidia is the earliest-diverging clade of sequenced fungi. Microsporidia are a large diverse group of intracellular parasites now considered as fungi. The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi. The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because of protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related to conventional Fungi, not Protozoa. The preponderance of evidence as to the origin of the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister group to it. In a subsequent analysis, we excluded the other Microsporidia from the analysis to look for relationships before the divergence of Microsporidia, and found that 43% of the microsporidial genes scored highest with fungal genes, and a higher mean LPI was found with Fungi than with other kingdoms, suggesting that Microsporidia is closely related to Fungi at the genomic level. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi.

Original Fanconi anemia data, for which no information about the ascertainment was available, were then analyzed, with results that confirmed a monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. X-linked inheritance has important consequences for genetic counseling of families with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B. Its presence as a single active copy and essentiality for a functional Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway make FANCB a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity.

Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average diameter of 10 nm. Ultrastructurally, rhabdoid cells showed paranuclear aggregates and whorls of intermediate filaments with a 9-10 nm diameter. After removing IFs by calcination, electron microscopy revealed hollow silica nanotubes several micrometers long, with outer diameters of 35-55 nm and an average inner diameter of 10 nm (comparable to that of IFs) Intermediate filaments are filaments 10 nm in diameter that make up an important component of the cytoskeleton in most metazoan taxa. Neurofilaments (NFs) are essential cytoskeletal filaments that impart mechanical integrity to nerve cells. They are assembled from three distinct molecular mass proteins that bind to each other to form a 10-nm-diameter filamentous rod with sidearm extensions. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs showed that acidic keratins and basic keratins can assemble into dimers and further into 10 nm filamentsin vitro. Intermediate in diameter between microtubules and microfilaments, IFs constitute the third cytoskeletal filament system of metazoan cells. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a diameter of 100 Angstroms and a low-density core. Further, using cryo-transmission electron microscopy on native, fully hydrated, vitreous epidermis we show that the subfilametous keratin electron density pattern consists, both in corneocytes and in viable keratinocytes, of one axial subfilament surrounded by an undetermined number of peripheral subfilaments forming filaments with a diameter of approximately 8 nm.

56e0447a51531f7e3300000b	Which are the smallest known subviral pathogens of plants?	Since the discovery of non-coding, small, highly structured, satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and viroids as subviral pathogens of plants , have been of great interest to molecular biologists as possible living fossils of pre-cellular evolution in an RNA world. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants.  Viroids are plant subviral pathogens whose genomes are constituted by a single-stranded and covalently closed small RNA molecule that does not encode for any protein.  Viroids are small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules that cause several infectious plant diseases.  Viroids: petite RNA pathogens with distinguished talents. Subviral pathogens of plants: viroids and viroidlike satellite RNAs. Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses are not the smallest causative agents of infectious diseases. Single-stranded RNAs as small as 246 nucleotides exist in certain higher plants and cause more than a dozen crop diseases. These RNAs have been termed viroids. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids. Viroids, subviral pathogens of plants, are composed of a single-stranded circular RNA of 246-399 nucleotides. During 1970 and 1971, I discovered that a devastating disease of potato plants is not caused by a virus, as had been assumed, but by a new type of subviral pathogen, the viroid. Viroids are so small--one fiftieth of the size of the smallest viruses--that many scientists initially doubted their existence.  The database of the smallest known auto-replicable RNA species: viroids and viroid-like RNAs. Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the &apos;brotherhood&apos; of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs.  Replicating circular RNAs are independent plant pathogens known as viroids, or act to modulate the pathogenesis of plant and animal viruses as their satellite RNAs. The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming.	['Viroids']
5e49c2356d0a277941000010	Which database exists that contains regulatory SNPs which affect predicted transcription factor binding site affinity?	SNP2TFBS - a database of regulatory SNPs affecting predicted transcription factor binding site affinity. SNP2TFBS is a computational resource intended to support researchers investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in the human genome. The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor. These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive SNP catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual SNP, to extract SNPs based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of SNPs or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected SNPs.

Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis.  We found that PB demonstrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2 mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively.  However, recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB.  Here, we compared the efficiency of two different transposon systems, Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB), for the generation of murine iPS.  However, recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. In this study, we compared the genomic integration efficiencies and transposition site preferences of Sleeping Beauty (SB or SB11), Tol2, and piggyBac (PB) transposon systems in primary T cells derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). We found that PB demonstrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2 mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively.  Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. Although Sleeping Beauty had no detectable genomic bias with respect to insertions in genes or intergenic regions, both Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons displayed preferential integration into actively transcribed loci. We have compared the chromosomal mobilization efficiency and insertion site preference of the two transposons mobilized from the same donor site in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions in which there were no selective constraints on the transposons&apos; insertion sites. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis.

Telomerase vaccination (GV1001) in combination with chemotherapy appeared to be safe but the immune responses were weak and transient.  Gemcitabine and capecitabine with or without telomerase peptide vaccine GV1001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (TeloVac): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential or simultaneous telomerase vaccination (GV1001) in combination with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects. Peptide GV1001 is a peptide vaccine representing a 16-amino acid human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence, which has been reported to possess potential antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory activity.  Based on this review, the most promising current telomerase targeting therapeutics are the antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor GRN163L and immunotherapies that use dendritic cells (GRVAC1), hTERT peptide (GV1001) or cryptic peptides (Vx-001). A reverse-transcriptase-subunit of telomerase (hTERT) derived peptide, GV1001, has been developed as a vaccine against various cancers. Of the increasing number of immunological agents, the GV1001 antitelomerase vaccine holds some interest.

5fe30e06a43ad31278000037	Which histone mark distinguishes active from inactive enhancers?	We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300.  This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an "active enhancer landscape" and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and H3K27me3, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. rthermore, like H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K14ac can also differentiate active enhancers from inactive ones. A  observation suggests that histone acetyl transferases (HATs) prime inactive genes by H3K14ac for stimuli dependent activation. In  e level of binding signal for TAL1 or GATA1 did not help distinguish TAL1-bound DNA segments as active versus inactive enhancers, nor did the density of regulation-related histone modifications.

5e2e11a1fbd6abf43b000021	Which de novo mutation in FGFR cause achondroplasia?	Achondroplasia, the most common cause of chondrodysplasia in man (1 in 15,000 live births), is a condition of unknown origin characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and macrocephaly. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals, suggesting that de novo mutations are of paternal origin. Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia. We show that the mutant genotype segregates with the disease in these families. Thus it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein account for all cases (23/23) of achondroplasia in our series.	['G380R']
5fe0b4cda43ad31278000034	Which conditions is caused by mutations in HFE?	The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined Hereditary hemochromatosis: HFE mutation analysis in Greeks reveals genetic heterogeneity Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians; reported disease frequencies vary from 0.3 to 0.8%. Identification of a candidate HFE gene in 1996 was soon followed by the description of two ancestral mutations The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in South Africa in order to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder.DESIGN: DNA samples of patient and control groups were screened for two common haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. High prevalence of the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation facilitates an improved diagnostic service for hereditary haemochromatosis in South Africa mutations of HFE, which is a candidate gene for hemochromatosis, Our data do not confirm an association of PCT with the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation, strongly associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European countries Haploinsufficiency of HFE may be one possible explanation for hemochromatosis in this patient. Geographic and racial/ethnic differences in HFE mutation frequencies in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Status of HFE mutation in thalassemia syndromes in north India Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive and most commonly inherited single gene disorder among Caucasians, with a prevalence of 5 per 1,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 10. Two point mutations were described and are referred as C282Y and H63D hereditary hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE These results suggest that lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage, and that this capacity is somehow related to the presence of the C282Y HFE mutation. Compared to previous studies, we show that HFE mutation can possess the risk of AD in transferrin-, APOE- and APP-normal patients. Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin-receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin, hepcidin, or ferroportin genes. Genotyping of hemochromatosis-associated mutations in the HFE gene by PCR-RFLP and a novel reverse hybridization method. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common condition caused by HFE gene mutations, can lead to excess iron storage and disease but clinical penetrance of HFE gene mutations is low and many people with elevated iron stores lack HFE mutations. The three main mutations in gene HFE (C282Y, H63D, S65C) are the cause of development of 97% of cases of inherent hemochromatosis. Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. He Genetic iron overload, or hemochromatosis, can be caused by mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin, and hepcidin genes. He Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). W The mechanism of excessive iron storage in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis caused by mutations of the HFE gene seems to be a failure to up-regulate hepcidin in the face of increased body iron ith the common disease hereditary hemochromatosis, which is often caused by an HFE mutation, may have retinal iron overload predisposing to AMD. Preliminary data  oxylase. New speculations have appeared on the possible relation of this role of iron and the occurrence of mutation of the recently discovered gene of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE, which may cause the iron overloading of the  Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least five different genes (HFE, HJV, TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP) involved in the production or activity of the liver hormone hepcidin, a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Neverth Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A.  The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.-20G>A and c.718A>G (p.K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively. There are 2 main causes of iron overload: hereditary hemochromatosis which is a primary cause, is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations of genes that control iron metabolism and secondary hemochromatosis caused by multitransfusions, chronic hemolysis, and intake of iron rich food. Less common non-HFE-related forms of hemochromatosis have been reported and are caused by mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 gene and in a gene localized to chromosome 1q. Most types of genetic hemochromatosis are due to mutations in the HFE gene, although similar iron overload and organ damage can also result from mutations in genes other than HFE in rare types of hemochromatosis. Mutations in HFE are the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Furthermore, these results suggest that natural genetic variation in the human ortholog TMPRSS6 might modify the clinical penetrance of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis, raising the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of TMPRSS6 could attenuate iron loading in this disorder. The hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE promotes the expression of hepcidin, a circulating hormone produced by the liver that inhibits dietary iron absorption and macrophage iron release. Mutations in the Hfe gene are associated with the iron overload disease, hemochromatosis. It is known that about 85% of patients with inherent hemochromatosis are either homo-zygotic agents of mutation C282Y or carry compound-heterozygote C282Y/H63D. Therefore, the molecular genetic study intended for detection of these three mutations in gene HFE takes important place in diagnostic of inherent hemochromatosis. [The comparison of three molecular genetic techniques for identifying major mutations in gene HFE related to development of inherent hemochromatosis.] The most common type of hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by HFE gene mutation. HFE participates in the regulation of iron metabolism, its mutations are primary cause of hereditary hemochromatosis and appear to be more frequent in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetic hemochromatosis now corresponds to six diseases, namely classical hemochromatosis HFE 1; juvenile hemochromatosis HFE 2 due to mutations in an unidentified gene on chromosome 1; hemochromatosis HFE 3 due to mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2); hemochromatosis HFE 4 caused by a mutation in the H subunit of ferritin; and hemochromatosis HFE 6 whose gene is hepcidine (HAMP). Mutations in HFE causing hemochromatosis are associated with primary hypertriglyceridemia. factors. Elevated iron storage is associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity, and all of them are associated with HTG.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze whether HFE mutations causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are associated with primary HTG.DESIGN: Genetic predisposition to HH was analyzed in a case-control study.SETTING: The study was conducted at University Hospital Lipid Clinic.PARTICIPANTS: We studied two groups: 1) the HTG group, composed of 208 patients; and 2) the control group, composed of 215 normolipemic subjects and 161 familial hypercholesterolemia patients.INTERVENTION: Two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We measured HH genetic predisposition difference between groups.RESULTS: HH genetic predisposition was 5.9 and 4.4 times highe	['Hemochromatosis', 'haemochromatosis', 'Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)']

56f3faed09dd18d46b000002	What is the mechanism of viroid replication?	Together with the specific alpha-amanitin sensitivity of viroid replication observed in vivo, these findings suggest that viroids replicate by an entirely novel mechanism in which infecting viroid RNA molecules are copied by the host enzyme which is normally responsible for the synthesis of nuclear precursors to messenger RNA In vitro synthesis of complementary RNA produces distinct transcripts larger than unit length thus reflecting the in vivo mechanism of viroid replication. This mechanism could account for the origin of viroids and also RNA viruses, whereby modules of genetic information may have undergone repeated exchange between RNA pathogens and the RNA of their hosts. The replication of many viral and subviral pathogens as well as the amplification of certain cellular genes proceeds via a rolling circle mechanism. Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation. Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent.  Subsequently, an in vitro selection procedure based on a model rolling circle replication assay was developed. Replication of these minimal genomes, composed exclusively by a circular RNA of 246-401 nt, occurs in the nucleus (family Pospiviroidae) or in the chloroplast (family Avsunviroidae) by an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism with three steps: (1) synthesis of longer-than-unit strands catalyzed by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases recruited and redirected to transcribe RNA templates, (2) cleavage to unit-length, which in family Avsunviroidae is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes, and (3) circularization through an RNA ligase or autocatalytically. Viroid replication: rolling-circles, enzymes and ribozymes. Viroid replication proceeds through an RNA-based rolling-circle mechanism with three steps that, with some variations, operate in both polarity strands: i) synthesis of longer-than-unit strands catalyzed by either the nuclear RNA polymerase II or a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, in both instances redirected to transcribe RNA templates, ii) cleavage to unit-length, which in the family Avsunviroidae is mediated by hammerhead ribozymes embedded in both polarity strands, while in the family Pospiviroidae the oligomeric RNAs provide the proper conformation but not the catalytic activity, and iii) circularization. Viroid replication is entirely dependent on host transcription machinery, and their replication/accumulation in the infected cells can activate RNA silencing-a host defense mechanism that targets the viroid itself.  Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation. Viroids replicate via a rolling circle mechanism, and cleavage/ligation requires extensive rearrangement of the highly base-paired native structure. Viroids are not translated; they are replicated by a host enzyme (or enzymes) (probably RNA polymerase II) via oligomeric RNA intermediates by a rolling circle mechanism. We hypothesize that the intramolecular self-ligation which produces circular conformers may contribute to the circularization step of the rolling circle replication, while the intermolecular non-enzymatic ligation is a potential mechanism for the sequence reassortment of viroids and viroid-like species Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) contains a viroid-like circular RNA that is presumed to replicate via a rolling circle replication mechanism mediated by cellular RNA polymerases Viroid replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism using either a symmetric or asymmetric pathway in three steps, RNA transcription, processing and ligation Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent.

However, the exact mechanism of rolling circle replication for HDV RNA and viroids is not clear.  Viroids replicate through a rolling circle mechanism that is exclusively RNA dependent. In this study, we initially revisited the determination of the replication initiation sites of peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd).

5a70d42899e2c3af26000002	Mutation of which gene causes arterial tortuosity syndrome?	Mutations in SLC2A10, a gene that encodes the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10, cause ATS. RECENT FINDINGS: Although arterial tortuosity has been primarily described in Loeys-Dietz syndrome due to TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mutations and in arterial tortuosity syndrome due to SLC210A mutations, recent studies that use quantitative measures of tortuosity suggest that tortuosity is present in many other genetic conditions associated with aortic dilation and dissection. Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, which encodes facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome: homozygosity for two novel and one recurrent SLC2A10 missense mutations in three families with severe cardiopulmonary complications in infancy and a literature review. ATS is caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene, which encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). Approximately 100 ATS patients have been described, and 21 causal mutations have been identified in the SLC2A10 gene. Mutations in SLC2A10/GLUT10, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, are associated with altered transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS).

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrythmogenic disease characterized by exercise--or stress--induced ventricular tachyarrythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases. Previously, autosomal dominant catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT [1]) was mapped to chromosome 1q42-43 with identification of pathogenic mutations in RYR2.  Several mutations in the genes encoding RyR1 and RyR2 have been identified in autosomal dominant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle, such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), central core disease (CCD), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2).

Phenotypes resulting from variants in LMNB1 and LMNB2 have been much less clearly defined.METHODS: We investigated exome and genome sequencing from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study and the 100,000 Genomes Project to identify novel microcephaly genes.RESULTS: Starting from a cohort of patients with extreme microcephaly, 13 individuals with heterozygous variants in the two human B-type lamins were identified. Recurrent variants were established to be de novo in nine cases and shown to affect highly conserved residues within the lamin ɑ-helical rod domain, likely disrupting interactions required for higher-order assembly of lamin filaments.CONCLUSION: We identify dominant pathogenic variants in LMNB1 and LMNB2 as a genetic cause of primary microcephaly, implicating a major structural component of the nuclear envelope in its etiology and defining a new form of laminopathy. The distinct nature of this lamin B-associated phenotype highlights the strikingly different developmental requirements for lamin paralogs and suggests a novel mechanism for primary microcephaly warranting future investigation.

The NDRG1 gene is located within this interval and NDRG1 mutations have been shown to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in humans (CMT4D). Genetic studies have revealed the following gene mutations as the causes of inherited neuropathies; PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, SOX10, SIMPLE/LITAF, ARHGEF10 for CMT1 (autosomal dominant demyelinating form); GDAP1, MTMR2, SBF2/MTMR13, KIAA1985, NDRG1 PRX for CMT4 (autosomal recessive demyelinating form), MFN2, KIF1B, RAB7, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8 for CMT2 (autosomal dominant axonal form); LMNA, GAN1, KCC3, TDP1, APTX, SETX for AR-CMT2 (autosomal recessive axonal form); GIB1 for CMTX (X-linked CMT); DNM2 for CMT-DI (autosomal dominant CMT with intermediate nerve conduction velocities); and DHH for minifascicular neuropathy.

In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1), at least 15 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage or point mutation of PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, EGR2, MTMR2, NDRG1, PRX, SOX10, GDAP1 and MTMR13/SBF2. In the primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2), at least 10 genes have been associated with these disorders; NEFL, KIF1B, MFN2, GAN1, LMNA, RAB7, GARS, TDP1, APTX, and SETX. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1). In the primary peripheral axonal neuropathies(CMT2), at least 8 genes have been associated with these disorders; the neurofilament light chain gene(NEFL), the kinesin 1B gene(KIF1B), the gigaxonin gene(GAN1), Lamin A/C(LMNA) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1(TDP1).  NDRG1 is an intracellular protein that is induced under a number of stress and pathological conditions, and it is thought to be associated with cell growth and differentiation. Recently, human NDRG1 was identified as a gene responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom (classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D), which is characterized by early-onset peripheral neuropathy, leading to severe disability in adulthood. Recent genetic studies have revealed their phenotypic and genetic diversities. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1). Recent genetic studies have revealed their phenotypic and genetic diversities. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1), at least 15 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage or point mutation of PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, EGR2, MTMR2, NDRG1, PRX, SOX10, GDAP1 and MTMR13/SBF2. Western blot analysis demonstrated an absence of NDRG1 protein in peripheral nerve biopsy of an affected Greyhound. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for polyneuropathy in Greyhounds and identified the first genetically characterized canine CMT model which offers an opportunity to gain further insights into the pathobiology and therapy of human NDRG1 associated CMT disease. In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1), at least 15 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage or point mutation of PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, EGR2, MTMR2, NDRG1, PRX, SOX10, GDAP1 and MTMR13/SBF2. The NDRG1 gene is located within this interval and NDRG1 mutations have been shown to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in humans (CMT4D). In the primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies(CMT1), at least 9 genes have been associated with the disorders; altered dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22) or point mutation of PMP22, the gap junction protein 1(GJB1), the myelin protein zero gene(MPZ), the early growth response gene 2(EGR2), the myotubularin-related protein 2 gene(MTMR2), the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the L-periaxin gene(PRX), SRY-related HMG-BOX gene 10(SOX10) and the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene(GDAP1).

53175e9fb166e2b80600000a	What is the physiological role of LKB1 involved in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome?	Recent functional genetic studies have pointed out that LKB1 plays a physiological role in controlling the Wnt-signaling pathway and activation of the pathway as a consequence of LKB1 haploinsufficiency might be responsible for the development of harmatomatous polyps. PJS polyps from all patients showed generalized membrane and cytoplasmic localizations of beta-catenin along the mucosal endothelium.

5319ac99b166e2b806000034	Which is the third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1?	The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.	['TBC1D7']
5c59872b86df2b9174000017	Which tool has been developed for coverage calculation for genomes?	Mosdepth: quick coverage calculation for genomes and exomes. Mosdepth is a new command-line tool for rapidly calculating genome-wide sequencing coverage. It measures depth from BAM or CRAM files at either each nucleotide position in a genome or for sets of genomic regions. Genomic regions may be specified as either a BED file to evaluate coverage across capture regions, or as a fixed-size window as required for copy-number calling. Mosdepth uses a simple algorithm that is computationally efficient and enables it to quickly produce coverage summaries. We demonstrate that mosdepth is faster than existing tools and provides flexibility in the types of coverage profiles produced.Availability and implementation: mosdepth is available from https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth under the MIT license.

5e51dc516d0a27794100003e	Which is the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in Europeans?	Loss-of-function nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans. The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort.METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses. We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

58853667e56acf5176000015	What is the effect of the direct interaction of Ikaros and Foxp1 in B-lymphocytes?	Direct interaction of Ikaros and Foxp1 modulates expression of the G protein-coupled receptor G2A in B-lymphocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We describe a novel physical and functional interaction between the proteins, which requires the central zinc finger domain of Ikaros. The Ikaros-Foxp1 interaction is abolished by deletion of this region, which corresponds to the IK6 isoform that is commonly associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also identify the Gpr132 gene, which encodes the orphan G protein-coupled receptor G2A, as a novel target for Foxp1.  Our results reveal a novel effect of Ikaros haploinsufficiency on Foxp1 functioning, and identify G2A as a potential modulator of the cell cycle in Ikaros-deleted B-ALL.

517818508ed59a060a000035	Which is the neurodevelopmental disorder associated to mutations in the X- linked gene mecp2?	Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Rett syndrome is one of the most common causes of complex disability in girls. It is characterized by early neurological regression that severely affects motor, cognitive and communication skills, by autonomic dysfunction and often a seizure disorder. It is a monogenic X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder related to mutation in MECP2, which encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2. Recently, this syndrome has been associated with mutations of the MECP2 gene, a transcriptional repressor of still unknown target genes. Here we report a detailed mutational analysis of 62 patients from UK and Italian archives, representing the first comparative study among different populations and one of the largest number of cases so far analyzed. Out of the 365 cases, 315 had MECP2 gene mutations and 3 had de novo CDKL5 gene mutations. No patients had FOXG1 mutation. Mutations were detected in ≈ 70% of classic and ≈ 21% of variant RTT, respectively. Amongst MR cases, 2.1% carried MECP2 mutations. Mutations in the MECP2 gene were detected in 13 of the 20 (65 percent) RS patients. This multicenter investigation into the phenotypic correlates of MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome has provided a greater depth of understanding than hitherto available about the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with commonly occurring mutations Mutation screening revealed 31 different mutations in 68 patients and 12 non-pathogenic polymorphisms. In this study, the MECP2 sequences in 121 unrelated Chinese patients with classical or atypical RTT were screened for deletions and mutations. In all, we identified 45 different MECP2 mutations in 102 of these RTT patients. Mutations in MECP2 were found in about 55% We identified mutations in the MECP2 gene and documented the clinical manifestations in 65 Rett syndrome patients to characterize the genotype-phenotype spectrum. We searched for mutations by sequencing the MECP2 coding region in 45 sporadic cases (35 with classic RTT, eight with variant forms and two males) and in seven families with two or more affected females. Following our previous report of mutations in two families and eight sporadic cases, we here present 18 additional mutations. The responsible gene, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), was recently discovered. Here we explore the spectrum of phenotypes resulting from MECP2 mutations. Both nonsense (R168X and R255X) and missense (R106W and R306C) mutations have been found, with multiple recurrences. Mutations were identified in 44/55 (80%) unrelated classical sporadic and familial RTT patients, but only 1/5 (20%) sporadic cases with suggestive but non-diagnostic features of RTT Collectively, we tested 228 unrelated female patients with a diagnosis of possible (209) or classic (19) RTT and found MECP2 mutations in 83 (40%) of 209 and 16 (84%) of 19 of the patients, respectively. Thirty-two different mutations were identified (8 missense, 9 nonsense, 1 splice site, and 14 frameshifts), of which 12 are novel and 9 recurrent in unrelated patients. Mutations in MECP2 were identified from most of the patients with classical and variant RTT (25 of 27 cases) In our series, 19 different de novo MECP2 mutations, eight of which were previously unreported, were found in 35 out of 50 Rett girls (70%) Causative mutations in the MeCP2 gene were identified in 63% of patients, representing a total of 30 different mutations. Mutations were identified in 72% of patients with classical RTT and one third of atypical cases studied (8 of 25). We have identified 15 different MECP2 mutations in 26 of 30 Danish RTT patients.

5aa50086d6d6b54f7900000c	Which is the function of ubiquilins?	Ubiquilin (UBQLN) proteins are adaptors thought to link ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Ubiquilins are proteins that function as ubiquitin receptors in eukaryotes. Mutations in two ubiquilin-encoding genes have been linked to the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, ubiquilin functions are still poorly understood. Ubiquitination and subsequently ubiquitin (Ub) receptor proteins (e.g., p62 and ubiquilins) are important common factors for targeting misfolded proteins to multiple quality control destinies, including the proteasome, lysosomes, and perhaps aggresomes, as well as for triggering mitophagy to remove defective mitochondria.  We show that Ubiquilin family proteins bind transmembrane domains in the cytosol to prevent aggregation and temporarily allow opportunities for membrane targeting. Over time, Ubiquilins recruit an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate bound clients. The attached ubiquitin engages Ubiquilin's UBA domain, normally bound to an intramolecular UBL domain, and stabilizes the Ubiquilin-client complex. Ubiquilins (Ubqlns) are a family of ubiquitin receptors that promote the delivery of hydrophobic and aggregated ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation.   Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways. Ubiquilins (UBQLN), a family of adaptor proteins with partial homology with ubiquitin, are proposed to facilitate proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated substrates	['Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways.']
58cd90c202b8c60953000040	What is the role of IL-18BP?	Interleukin 18--binding protein ameliorates liver ischemia--reperfusion injury.  IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective effects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme activities and cytokine levels.  Because of IL-18's potential pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive effects, its biological activities are tightly controlled in the body by its naturally occurring antagonist called IL-18BP. The antagonist is produced in the body both constitutively and in response to an increased production of IL-18 as a negative feedback mechanism. Under physiological conditions, most of IL-18 in the circulation is bound with IL-18BP and is inactive. However, an imbalance in the production of IL-18 and its antagonist (an increase in the production of IL-18 with a decrease, no increase or an insufficient increase in the production of IL-18BP) has been described in many chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. L-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.  Platelets also contain the IL-18 antagonist, the IL-18-Binding Protein (IL-18BP) The natural inhibitor IL-18BP , whose production is enhanced by IFN-γ and IL-27, further regulates IL-18 activity in the extracellular environment.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-18.  IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. The balance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important role in the inflammatory setting.	['IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.

5aa55b45d6d6b54f7900000d	What organism causes scarlet fever also known as scarletina?	Scarlet fever is one of a variety of diseases caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS). In a small epidemic of scarlet fever a healthy carrier of hemolytic streptococcus was detected; the organism carried was identical in its serological reactions with strains of hemolytic streptococci isolated from active cases of scarlet fever. No morphological or cultural characteristics peculiar to the hemolytic streptococcus from scarlet fever can be demonstrated. Application of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and comparative sequencing of the gene (speA) encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (scarlet fever toxin) revealed that new waves of scarlet fever are associated with an increase in frequency of S. pyogenes clones carrying variant speA alleles. Additionally, S. pyogenes induces toxin-mediated syndromes, i. e. scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF).

5880e417713cbdfd3d000001	Which disease is treated with ZMapp?	Gene Transfer of ZMapp Antibodies Mediated by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Protects Against Ebola Infections. Vectored delivery of the ZMapp antibody cocktail (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) by using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) could be useful for preventive immunization against Ebola virus infections because rAAVs can generate long-term antibody expression. ZMapp Reinforces the Airway Mucosal Barrier Against Ebola Virus. Addition of ZMapp, a cocktail of Ebola-binding immunoglobulin G antibodies, effectively reduced mobility of Ebola pseudovirus in the same mucus secretions. Topical delivery of ZMapp to the mouse airways also facilitated rapid elimination of Ebola pseudovirus.  Several strategies have been developed in the past to treat EBOV infection, including the antibody cocktail ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in nonhuman primate models of infection 1 and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans 2  Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.  Only recently have vaccine or drug regimens for the Ebola virus been developed, including Zmapp and peptides.  Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir, favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp).  The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. However, during the recent outbreak, monoclonal antibody cocktails such as ZMapp, ZMAb and MB-003 were either tested in a human clinical safety and efficacy trial or provided to some based on compassionate grounds. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. BACKGROUND  Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). For example, several patients of the present Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa were treated with ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies which are expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) . Several patients with Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies , TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA , brincidofovir , and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics . BACKGROUND Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). METHODS Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of care alone in patients with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an experimental drug named ZMapp was administered on an emergency basis to seven patients of which five were recovered. BACKGROUND: Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. This includes agents belonging to various therapeutic classes, namely direct antiviral agents (favipiravir and BCX4430), a combination of antibodies (ZMapp), type I interferons, RNA interference-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and anticoagulant drugs (rNAPc2).  During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients.  Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics.  The human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail ZMapp, previously shown to be efficacious in EBOV (variant Kikwit) lethally infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administration was initiated up to 5 days, was used in some patients during the outbreak. We show that a two-antibody cocktail, MIL77E, is fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV variant Makona, the virus responsible for the ongoing 2014-2015 outbreak, whereas a similar formulation of ZMapp protected two of three NHPs.  The growing promise of plant-made biologics is highlighted by the success story of ZMapp™ as a potentially life-saving drug during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016.  Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp. Background Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Several patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA, brincidofovir, and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics. Also there is no specific vaccine and treatment for Ebola virus; however, many candidate vaccines and antiviral-drugs such as ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are being developed for Ebola virus disease. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of ZMapp for Ebola Virus Infection. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola.  Going forward, this work now provides a basis for strategic selection of next-generation antibody cocktails against Ebola and related viruses and a model for predicting the impact of ZMapp on potential escape mutations in ongoing or future Ebola outbreaks. Some potential therapeutic materials including ZMapp were supplied and the treated people got over the EVD. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. This review explores some of the more prominent recent advances in the biofarming of viral vaccines and therapies, including the recent use of ZMapp for Ebolavirus infection, and explores some possible future applications of the technology.

51387022bee46bd34c000002	Which is the process that Conserved noncoding elements mostly regulate?	Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development. Some characteristics of CNEs include their high frequency in mammalian genomes, their potential regulatory role in gene expression, and their enrichment in gene deserts nearby master developmental genes Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes. These results suggest important roles for SINEs in the development of the mammalian neuronal network, a part of which was initiated with the exaptation of AmnSINE1 in a common mammalian ancestor. Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation. The majority of tetrapod-specific UCEs are noncoding and associated with genes involved in regulation of transcription and development. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development	['Development']

In brain homogenates with Aβo, the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is reversed by mGluR5-directed antagonists or antibodies directed against the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153. Silent allosteric modulators of mGluR5 do not alter Glu or basal mGluR5 activity, but they disrupt the Aβo-induced interaction of mGluR5 with PrP(C) The assays described here have the potential to identify and develop new compounds that inhibit the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by transmitting the signal from extracellular Aβo into the cytosol. Silent Allosteric Modulation of mGluR5 Maintains Glutamate Signaling while Rescuing Alzheimer's Mouse Phenotypes.

601c3fc21cb411341a000019	Which receptor is blocked by Finerenone?	Finerenone (FIN), a novel, nonsteroidal, potent, and selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improves endothelial dysfunction through enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreasing superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in vascular and renal superoxide dismutase activity. Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys. Other nonsteroidal MRA such as apararenone, finerenone, AZD9977, and LY2623091 are in different clinical trials in patients with hypertension suffering from renal or hepatic fibrotic diseases. (-)-Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes.  Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists: a Comprehensive Review of Finerenone. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to review the mechanism of action and safety profile of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and discuss the differences between selective and non-selective MRAs. More specifically, finerenone is a new medication that is currently under investigation for its promising cardiovascular and nephrological effects.  A new selective MRA named finerenone (originally BAY 94-8862) has shown promising results in several trials (ARTS-HF and ARTS-DN) and smaller studies. Finerenone may have a dose-dependent benefit over older MRAs, decreasing rates of albuminuria and levels of BNP and NT-ProBNP without causing a significant increase in serum potassium levels. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism by finerenone is sufficient to improve function in preclinical muscular dystrophy. The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone prevents cardiac fibrotic remodeling. A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis induced by short-term isoproterenol injection was used to compare the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone and the steroidal MRA eplerenone in equi-efficient systemic MR blocking dosages. Finerenone is a novel selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Finerenone is a selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Nonsteroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Finerenone Protects Against Acute Kidney Injury-Mediated Chronic Kidney Disease: Role of Oxidative Stress. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored. The Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rat is a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low nitric oxide availability. We hypothesize that the new highly selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, finerenone, reverses both endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Two months after coronary artery ligation causing MI, mice with VSMC-specific MR deletion (MI-MR(SMKO)) and mice treated with the MR antagonist finerenone (MI-fine) had improved left ventricular compliance and elastance when compared with infarcted control mice (MI-CTL), as well as reduced interstitial fibrosis. Importantly, the coronary reserve assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was preserved (difference in myocardial perfusion before and after induction of vasodilatation, mL mg(-1) min(-1): MI-CTL: 1.1 ± 0.5, nonsignificant; MI-MR(SMKO): 4.6 ± 1.6 [P<0.05]; MI-fine: 3.6 ± 0.7 [P<0.01]). AIMS: To investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and at high risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening renal dysfunction. Finerenone : third-generation mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and diabetic kidney disease. Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal MRA, with higher selectivity toward the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared to spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone. Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy.

530cf4c54a5037880c000008	What is the name of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?	Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL.  Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1.  Targeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.  Next, we used this model to study ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development.  Ibrutinib: a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor with outstanding responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown highly encouraging results in phase I/II trials in patients with treatment-naive, relapsed and refractory CLL even in the presence of high risk disease or poor prognostic markers.  The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor.  Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis.  Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy.  More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263).

57092332cf1c325851000018	What is the molecular function of the Chd1 protein?	The DNA-binding domain of the Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzyme contains SANT and SLIDE domains The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzyme Chd1 is a 168-kDa protein consisting of a double chromodomain, Snf2-related ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The presence of these domains in ISWI and Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzymes may provide a means of efficiently harnessing the action of the Snf2-related ATPase domain for the purpose of nucleosome spacing and provide an explanation for partial redundancy between these proteins. Here we identify the chromatin remodelling protein Chd1 (chromo-ATPase/helicase-DNA binding domain 1) as a component of SAGA and SLIK one of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity Human but not yeast CHD1 binds directly and selectively to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 via its tandem chromodomains In the current study, we identify human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4 human CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein. We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not.  Analysis of nucleosome repositioning by yeast ISWI and Chd1 chromatin remodeling complexes. However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end, whereas Isw1b can. The ISWI and CHD1 chromatin remodelling activities influence ADH2 expression and chromatin organization Here we show that the absence of the Isw1 and Chd1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activities delays the maximal expression of ADH2 without impairing the chromatin remodelling that occurs upon activation. Thus, the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling, but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome. the lack of Chd1 combined with the absence of Isw1 and Isw2 impairs nucleosome spacing along the ADH2 gene, and genome-wide in S. cerevisiae Through inclusion of Chd1 sequences in homology searches SLIDE domains were identified in CHD6-9 proteins.  The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster.  Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9. Histone H3K4 and K36 methylation, Chd1 and Rpd3S oppose the functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4-Spt5 in transcription. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.

Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9.  Chromodomain from heterochromatin protein 1 and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine-methylated histone H3 tail-binding module. Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, containing two tandem chromodomains. Over-expression of an ATPase inactive form of CHD1 did not result in severe chromosomal defects, suggesting that the ATPase activity is required for this in vivo phenotype. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.

In this commentary, we review literature on sexual behavior change accompanying PrEP use, discuss risk compensation concerns and the &amp;quot;Truvada whore&amp;quot; stereotype as PrEP barriers, question the appropriateness of restricting PrEP access because of risk compensation, and consider sexual pleasure as a benefit of PrEP, an acceptable motive for seeking PrEP, and a core element of health.  BACKGROUND Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples. Its co-formulation with emtricitabine (Truvada) is particularly convenient for treating both HIV and HBV in co-infected individuals. In January 2011, following publication of evidence of safety and efficacy of daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (TDF)/emtricitabine 200 mg (FTC) (Truvada, Gilead Sciences) as antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk for HIV acquisition among MSM in the iPrEx trial, CDC issued interim guidance to make available information and important initial cautions on the use of PrEP in this population. Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. BACKGROUND Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples. Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Truvada]) prevents HIV without penalizing sexual pleasure, and may even enhance pleasure (e.g., by reducing HIV-related anxiety). The pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug Truvada is a new HIV prevention technology that is predominantly promoted as relevant to HIV-negative gay men. INTRODUCTION The FEM-PrEP trial was a pre-exposure prophylaxis clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine) in the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using the antiretroviral drug emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of HIV acquisition for women at higher risk of infection if taken daily. Third, Truvada can be used prophylactically to prevent transmission of HIV infection. Daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (emtricitabine FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate TDF) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to reduce HIV incidence among men who have sex with men. It is the only drug approved to prevent HIV infections, and Truvada is the key pharmaceutical component of pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is aimed at preventing, rather than treating, HIV infection and transmission. Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples.

5c588efb86df2b9174000004	What is the mechanism of action of Brigatinib?	Molecular inhibitory mechanism study on the potent inhibitor brigatinib against four crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations. As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer. In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib.   Together, the detailed explanation of mechanisms of those mutations with brigatinib further provide several guidelines for the development of more effective ALK inhibitors. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents.RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib.  With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n = 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n = 25). Lung toxicity is a rare albeit potentially severe side effect in NSCLC patients receiving ALK-TKIs, apparently more frequent with brigatinib.  Ceritinib and alectinib are approved for metastatic ALK positive NSCLC patients, while brigatinib received granted accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration.  Since the discovery, development and approval of crizotinib in 2011, three second-generation ALK-TKIs, ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib have been approved by the FDA. In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib. These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region. As a potent and selective drug, brigatinib exhibits high efficacy against wild-type and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proteins to treat non-small cell lung cancer. This report describes the design and synthesis of a series of 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine-based potent and selective ALK inhibitors culminating in identification of the investigational clinical candidate brigatinib. Brigatinib displayed low nanomolar IC50s against native ALK and all tested clinically relevant ALK mutants in both enzyme-based biochemical and cell-based viability assays and demonstrated efficacy in multiple ALK+ xenografts in mice, including Karpas-299 (anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [ALCL]) and H3122 (NSCLC).

5335f053d6d3ac6a34000055	How can the expression of SerH3 immobilization antigen be regulated?	mRNA stability plays a major role in regulating the temperature-specific expression of a Tetrahymena thermophila surface protein. The presence of specific proteins (known as immobilization antigens) on the surface of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is under environmental regulation. A temperature shift from 40 to 28 degrees C rapidly induced expression of a specific immobilization antigen at the cell surface in Tetrahymena thermophila.  Expression of each allele is regulated by temperature-sensitive mRNA stability. H mRNAs are stable at <36 degrees but are unstable at >36 degrees.  In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of the temperature-specific surface protein SerH3 is controlled primarily by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of its mRNA.  we studied SerH3-ts1, a temperature-sensitive allele of the temperature-regulated SerH3 gene normally expressed from 20-36 degrees.  In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of a temperature-specific surface protein known as SerH3 is primarily controlled by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of the mRNA that encodes this protein.  The expression of Tetrahymena surface proteins serotype H3 (SerH3) and serotype T (SerT) is under environmental regulation. SerH3 is expressed when cells are incubated between the temperatures of 20 and 35 degrees C, while SerT is expressed when cells are grown at temperatures above 35 degrees C.  The surfaces of Tetrahymena thermophila cells grown between 20 and 35 degrees C are covered by one or more variants of H antigens.  SerH3, a Tetrahymena thermophila gene encoding a temperature-regulated surface antigen. In the holotrich Tetrahymena thermophila five alternative cell surface immobilization proteins (i-antigens) are expressed under different conditions of temperature (L, H, T) and culture media (I, S).

51724fca8ed59a060a000013	Which  is the execution time (complexity) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences	The problem of finding an optimal structural alignment for a pair of superimposed proteins is often amenable to the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm, which runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned. While this result is not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm, its complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches. If we use N, M and C to represent the size of an amino acid sequence, the size of a structure template, and the maximum cut size of long-range interactions, respectively, the algorithm finds an optimal structure-sequence alignment in O(21C NM) time, a polynomial function of N and M when C = O(log(N + M)). When running on structure-sequence alignment problems without long-range intersections, i.e. C = 0, the algorithm achieves the same asymptotic computational complexity of the Smith-Waterman sequence-sequence alignment algorithm. The algorithm is based on fractional programming and its running time is O(n2log n). In practice, normalized local alignment is only 3-5 times slower than the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm.

5c580aff07647bbc4b00001a	Which ultraconserved element is associated with Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) self-renewal?	An Ultraconserved Element Containing lncRNA Preserves Transcriptional Dynamics and Maintains ESC Self-Renewal. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) show the peculiar feature to retain extended perfect sequence identity among human, mouse, and rat genomes. Most of them are transcribed and represent a new family of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the transcribed UCEs (T-UCEs). Despite their involvement in human cancer, the physiological role of T-UCEs is still unknown. Here, we identify a lncRNA containing the uc.170+, named T-UCstem1, and provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that it plays essential roles in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by modulating cytoplasmic miRNA levels and preserving transcriptional dynamics.

5fe09c99a43ad31278000033	What percentage of C. elegans genes reside in operons?	Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.  Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome. Operons are widespread in prokaryotes, but are uncommon in eukaryotes, except nematode worms, where approximately 15% of genes reside in over 1100 operons in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Overall, our data demonstrate that >17% of all C. elegans genes are in operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Like more than 15% of C. elegans genes, xrn-2 occurs in an operon, and we identify additional operons under its control, consistent with a broader function of XRN2 in polycistronic gene regulation. provides convincing evidence that at least 15% of Caenorhabditis elegans genes are co-transcribed within over a thousand operons. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the genome contains >1000 operons that compose approximately 15% of the protein-coding genes. Genes in nematode and ascidian genomes frequently occur in operons--multiple genes sharing a common promoter to generate a polycistronic primary transcript--and such genes comprise 15-20% of the coding genome for Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis.

51bdd9c2047fa84d1d000002	Which is the receptor for substrates of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy?	These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor. CMA activity has been shown to be proportional to levels of the CMA receptor Lamp-2a. Lysosomes from livers of lipid-challenged mice had a marked decrease in the levels of the CMA receptor, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A, We report that Bcl-2-related early rod apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of autophagy markers including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) substrate receptor LAMP-2 we examined gene expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane 2 (LAMP-2), a CMA receptor The lysosomal-membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) acts as the receptor for the substrates of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective type of autophagy by which specific cytosolic proteins are sent to lysosomes for degradation. Substrate proteins bind to the lysosomal membrane through the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), one of the three splice variants of the lamp2 gene, and this binding is limiting for their degradation via CMA. Substrate proteins only bind to monomeric LAMP-2A, while the efficient translocation of substrates requires the formation of a particular high-molecular-weight LAMP-2A complex We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA In this study, we found that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for CMA, We have previously described an age-related decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy, by which particular cytosolic proteins are delivered to lysosomes after binding to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), a receptor for this pathway. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective pathway for the degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. CMA declines with age because of a decrease in the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) type 2A, a lysosomal receptor for this pathway. Oxidation-induced activation of CMA correlates with higher levels of several components of the lysosomal translocation complex, but in particular of the lumenal chaperone, required for substrate uptake, and of the lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a, previously identified as a receptor for this pathway. We now demonstrate that this protease activity triggers the degradation of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a), a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). We have previously identified this receptor as the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a) Lamp2a acts as a receptor in the lysosomal membrane for substrate proteins of chaperone-mediated autophagy. These characteristics may be important for lamp2a to act as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy. A progressive age-related decrease in the levels of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a that acts as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy Hsc70 and Hsp40 are members of a molecular chaperone complex required for protein transport into the lysosome during chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Once there, substrate proteins bind to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2 isoform A (LAMP2A), inducing assembly of this receptor protein into a higher molecular weight protein complex that is used by the substrate proteins to reach the lysosomal lumen.  Protein substrates bind to a receptor in the lysosomal membrane, the lysosome-associated membrane protein (lamp) type 2a.	['LAMP2A', 'Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform A']

The OTOF (Locus: DFNB9), encoding otoferlin, is reported to be one of the major causes of non-syndromic hearing loss, and is also reported to be the most common cause of non-syndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Otoferlin (OTOF) gene mutations are the most common cause of hereditary ANSD according to investigations in several countries. Different mutations of the OTOF gene, encoding for otoferlin protein expressed in the cochlear inner hair cells, induces a form of deafness that is the major cause of nonsyndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder in humans. Mutations in OTOF (otoferlin) can be the cause of nonsyndromic deafness DFNB9. The OTOF gene encodes otoferlin, a critical protein at the synapse of auditory sensory cells, the inner hair cells (IHCs).

601bde6e1cb411341a000006	Which disease is caused by de novo VPS4A mutations?	De Novo VPS4A Mutations Cause Multisystem Disease with Abnormal Neurodevelopment. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) are essential for multiple membrane modeling and membrane-independent cellular processes. Here we describe six unrelated individuals with de novo missense variants affecting the ATPase domain of VPS4A, a critical enzyme regulating ESCRT function. Probands had structural brain abnormalities, severe neurodevelopmental delay, cataracts, growth impairment, and anemia. In cultured cells, overexpression of VPS4A mutants caused enlarged endosomal vacuoles resembling those induced by expression of known dominant-negative ATPase-defective forms of VPS4A. Proband-derived fibroblasts had enlarged endosomal structures with abnormal accumulation of the ESCRT protein IST1 on the limiting membrane. VPS4A function was also required for normal endosomal morphology and IST1 localization in iPSC-derived human neurons. Mutations affected other ESCRT-dependent cellular processes, including regulation of centrosome number, primary cilium morphology, nuclear membrane morphology, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle formation, and cell cycle progression. We thus characterize a distinct multisystem disorder caused by mutations affecting VPS4A and demonstrate that its normal function is required for multiple human developmental and cellular processes.

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000d	Which hormone abnormalities are common in Williams syndrome ?	WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. The cortisol awakening response in WS was associated with parent-reported levels of somatic complaints and social difficulties. Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile that may be sensitive to social and activity transitions throughout the day. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior.  Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects.  Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized by cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended.  In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation.  Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.  None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism.  Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well.  Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). A WS patient with CPP is presented, whose pubertal development and bone age progression were arrested by administration of GnRH analogues.   This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy.  In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height. Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent.  Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS.  Thyroid hemiagenesis and elevated thyrotropin levels in a child with Williams syndrome. A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. However, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and thyroid dysgenesis have been found in other WS cases.  We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.  Although growth hormone deficiency is not likely to be a common cause of short stature in Williams-Beuren syndrome, we nevertheless recommend evaluation of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis in all cases. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.  Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels.  These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion. It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome.   These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion, compared with a group of seven normal children. Our studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome. Additional periodic evaluations during childhood: serum concentration of calcium, thyroid function, hearing, and renal and bladder ultrasound examination. Periodic evaluations during adulthood: glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, and arterial stenosis; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function.  Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%).	['thyroid']
5e50123e6d0a277941000036	Which programming language has been used for implementing GWAR?	In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there is a variety of statistical techniques in order to conduct the analysis, but, in most cases, the underlying genetic model is usually unknown. Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results: The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls. Overall, this is the first complete effort to implement procedures for analysis and meta-analysis in GWAS using Stata.Availability and Implementation: A Stata program and a web-server are freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/GWAR.

6060701c94d57fd87900003c	Which R/bioconductor package exists for discovery of intergenic transcripts?	PRAM: a novel pooling approach for discovering intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments. Publicly available RNA-seq data is routinely used for retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology. Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA-seq data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a '2-Step' approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq data sets, we developed a novel '1-Step' approach named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA-seq data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of PRAM to mouse hematopoietic RNA-seq data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene Pik3cg implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human. PRAM is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package.	['PRAM', 'Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models']
5d35be1cb3a6380763000005	What is the function of WAPL protein on cohesin?	Human Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that promotes sister-chromatid resolution in mitotic prophase We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase. Conversely, overexpression of Wapl causes premature separation of sister chromatids. Wapl physically associates with cohesin in HeLa-cell nuclear extracts. Wapl controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin Here, we show that the interaction between cohesin and chromatin is controlled by Wapl, a protein implicated in heterochromatin formation and tumorigenesis. Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay. Wapl depletion also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin in interphase. Our data indicate that Wapl is required to unlock cohesin from a particular state in which it is stably bound to chromatin. In recent articles published in Cell and Current Biology, the characterization of Wapl, a newly identified cohesin-interacting protein, suggests that a dynamic interaction between the cohesin complex and chromatin is important for normal regulation of sister chromatid cohesion. Wapl protein regulates binding of the cohesin complex to chromosomes during interphase and helps remove cohesin from chromosomes at mitosis Wapl-AG was found to increase the stability of cohesin binding to polytene chromosomes. Our data suggest that increasing cohesin stability interferes with PcG silencing at genes that are co-regulated by cohesin and PcG proteins. . First, during prophase and prometaphase, the bulk of cohesin is driven from chromosome arms by the cohesin antagonist WAPL.  s a consequence, WAPL-depleted cells undergo anaphase with segregation errors, including both lagging chromosomes and catenanes, resulting in micronuclei and DNA damage. Stable WAPL depletion arrests cells in a p53-dependent manner but causes p53-deficient cells to become highly aneuploid. Our data show that the WAPL-dependent prophase pathway is essential for proper chromosome segregation and is crucial to maintain genomic integrity. cohesin suppresses compartments but is required for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops ohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL. The Cohesin Release Factor WAPL Restricts Chromatin Loop Extension. Cohesin's DNA release factor WAPL restricts this loop extension and also prevents looping between incorrectly oriented CTCF sites We conclude that the balanced activity of SCC2/SCC4 and WAPL enables cohesin to correctly structure chromosomes. Cohesin is positioned in mammalian genomes by transcription, CTCF and Wapl. the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl).  In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. the cohesin regulator Wapl promotes the release of cohesin from chromosomes during both interphase and mitosis.  Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl differentially control cohesin chromosome association and function. Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin. Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction. 	['Wapl is a cohesin unloading factor']

In this report, interactions between human Ctf4 (hCtf4) and the replicative helicase containing the cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45)/minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (Mcm2-7)/Go, Ichi, Nii, and San (GINS) (CMG) proteins [human CMG (hCMG) complex] were examined We demonstrate that the hCtf4-CMG complex contains a homodimeric hCtf4 and a monomeric hCMG complex and suggest that the homodimeric hCtf4 acts as a platform linking polymerase α to the hCMG complex Drosophila Ctf4 is essential for efficient DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression The Ctf4 protein has been shown to be a central member of the replication fork and links the replicative MCM helicase and DNA polymerase α primase  it has been implicated as a member of a complex that promotes replication fork stability, the Fork Protection Complex (FPC), and as being important for sister chromatid cohesion Drosophila Ctf4 is a conserved protein that interacts with members of the GINS complex, Mcm2, and Polymerase α primase Ctf4 remains a central player in DNA replication These data indicate that Ctf4p facilitates Mcm10p to promote the DNA replication  hCtf4 plays an essential role in DNA replication and its ability to stimulate the replicative DNA polymerases  Our data indicate that a complex of the GINS and Ctf4 components of the RPC is crucial to couple MCM2-7 to DNA polymerase alpha coupling MCM2-7 to replicative polymerases is an important feature of the regulation of chromosome replication in eukaryotes, and highlight a key role for Ctf4 in this process Ctf4 coordinates the progression of helicase and DNA polymerase alpha Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication We show that And-1/Ctf4 (Chromosome transmission fidelity 4) interacts with Mcm10, which associates with MCM2-7, and with the p180 subunit of DNA pol alpha And-1/Ctf4 is therefore a new replication initiation factor that brings together the MCM2-7 helicase and the DNA pol alpha-primase complex, analogous to the linker between helicase and primase or helicase and polymerase that is seen in the bacterial replication machinery Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication. Ctf4 remains a central player in DNA replication. Drosophila Ctf4 is essential for efficient DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression. Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1 on DNA replication. Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In this report, we examined the mechanism of action of human Ctf4 (hCtf4) in DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo. And-1/Ctf4 is therefore a new replication initiation factor that brings together the MCM2-7 helicase and the DNA pol alpha-primase complex, analogous to the linker between helicase and primase or helicase and polymerase that is seen in the bacterial replication machinery. We show that cells lacking both Ctf4 and Mrc1 experience chronic activation of the DNA damage checkpoint during chromosome replication and do not complete the cell cycle. Using in vivo RNAi knockdown of CTF4 in Drosophila we show that Ctf4 is required for viability, S phase progression, sister chromatid cohesion, endoreplication, and coping with replication stress. We show that Ctf4 function is conserved and that Drosophila can be effectively used as a model to further probe the precise function of Ctf4 as a member of the replication fork and possible roles in development. Chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (Ctf4) is a conserved protein required for DNA replication. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. A key role for Ctf4 in coupling the MCM2-7 helicase to DNA polymerase alpha within the eukaryotic replisome.

In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling repair factor Adaptive (stationary phase) mutagenesis is a phenomenon by which nondividing cells acquire beneficial mutations as a response to stress. the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels.
