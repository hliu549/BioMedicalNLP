{"id": "643c183b57b1c7a31500002c_2", "question": "What are the most common assays to profile chromatin accessibility?", "context": "Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) originating from Staphylococcus aureus is a calcium dependent ribo- and desoxyribonuclease which has endo- and exonucleolytic activity of low sequence preference. MNase is widely used to analyze nucleosome positions in chromatin by probing the enzyme's DNA accessibility in limited digestion reactions.", "label": "yes"}

{"id": "643c183b57b1c7a31500002c_4", "question": "What are the most common assays to profile chromatin accessibility?", "context": "Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies and accompanying reductions in cost have led to an explosion of techniques to examine DNA accessibility and protein localization on chromatin genome-wide. Generally, accessible regions of chromatin are permissive for factor binding and are therefore hotspots for regulation of gene expression; conversely, genomic regions that are highly occupied by histone proteins are not permissive for factor binding and are less likely to be active regulatory regions.", "label": "yes"}
