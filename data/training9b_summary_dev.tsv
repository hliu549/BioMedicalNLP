5507fc114b2a315d41000003	What is the biological role of K-48 linked protein ubiquitination?	On the LCV, AnkB triggers docking of K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins that are degraded by the host proteasomes to elevate cellular levels of amino acids needed for intracellular proliferation.  Transcription and injection of ankB is triggered by attached extracellular bacteria followed by rapid farnesylation and anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane beneath bacterial attachment, where K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins are assembled and degraded by the proteasomes, leading to a rapid rise in the cellular levels of amino acids. Although it has been known for a long time that ubiquitylation has a major role in the activation and regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, recent studies have revealed that the picture is a lot more complex than originally thought. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins.  The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  Covalent and reversible post-translational modifications of proteins are a common theme in signaling. Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues. Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system. Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery	['The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.

5c6f0ebf7c78d69471000050	What is the mechanism of action of Pitolisant?	The histamine H3 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug target that is highly expressed in the CNS, where it acts as both an auto- and hetero-receptor to regulate neurotransmission. As such, it has been considered as a relevant target in disorders as varied as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A range of competitive antagonists/inverse agonists have progressed into clinical development, with pitolisant approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. Given the breadth of compounds developed and potential therapeutic indications, we assessed the comparative pharmacology of six investigational histamine H3 agents, including pitolisant, using native tissue and recombinant cells. Whilst all of the compounds tested displayed robust histamine H3 receptor inverse agonism and did not differentiate between the main H3 receptor splice variants, they displayed a wide range of affinities and kinetic properties, and included rapidly dissociating (pitolisant, S 38093-2, ABT-239) and slowly dissociating (GSK189254, JNJ-5207852, PF-3654746) agents. Furthermore, pitolisant, ABT-239 and PF-3654746 also displayed appreciable sigma-1 receptor affinity, suggesting that this property differentiates clinically evaluated histamine H3 receptor antagonists and may play a role in their efficacy. The pharmacological profile of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, indicates that this compound might reduce body weight and metabolic disturbances.   Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the following classes of drugs as narcolepsy treatments: alerting medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol [JZP-110]), antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), sodium oxybate, and the H3-receptor inverse agonist/antagonist pitolisant. In March 2016, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for pitolisant (WakixR) (as the first representative of the H3 inverse agonists) for the treatment of narcolepsy. The involvement of histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) in memory is well known, and the potential of H3R antagonists in therapeutic management of neuropsychiatric diseases, e.g., Alzheimer disease (AD) is well established. Therefore, the effects of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonist E159 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male rats on dizocilpine (DIZ)-induced memory deficits were studied in passive avoidance paradigm (PAP) and in novel object recognition (NOR) using pitolisant (PIT) and donepezil (DOZ) as standard drugs. Pitolisant is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the human histamine H3 receptor.  The small molecule drug, pitolisant, acts as an inverse agonist/antagonist at the H3 receptor, thus increasing histaminergic tone in the wake promoting system of the brain.

52ed27c098d0239505000030	What is the role of thyroid hormone in Stem cell differentiation?	During T3-dependent amphibian metamorphosis, the digestive tract is extensively remodeled from the larval to the adult form for the adaptation of the amphibian from its aquatic herbivorous lifestyle to that of a terrestrial carnivorous frog. This involves de novo formation of ASCs that requires T3 signaling in both the larval epithelium and nonepithelial tissues. Our results revealed that T3 induces distinct tissue-specific gene regulation programs associated with the remodeling of the intestine, particularly the formation of the ASCs, and further suggested the existence of potentially many novel stem cell-associated genes, at least in the intestine during development. BMP signaling is an important modulator of the late differentiation stages in MSC chondrogenesis and the thyroid hormone induces this pathway.  In addition, thyroid hormone treatment of hiPS-CMs attenuated the fetal gene expression in favor of a more adult-like pattern.  Exposure of embryos at this developmental stage for 24 h to either a TH antagonist, NH-3, or to tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant and known TH disruptor, differentially modulated the expression of a number of TH target genes implicated in neural stem cell function or neural differentiation.  In the intestinal epithelium and the retina, TRα1 and TRβ2 are expressed at the level of the precursors where they induce cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.  Thyroid hormone signaling acts as a neurogenic switch by repressing Sox2 in the adult neural stem cell niche. We will discuss observations suggesting that liganded T3 receptor (TR) regulates cell autonomous formation of adult intestinal progenitor cells and that T3 action in the connective tissue is important for the establishment of the stem cell niche. In general, in vitro stem cell differentiation techniques stimulate a wide range of developmental programs, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR) pathways. Although no difference of in vitro proliferation of NSCs was observed in the presence of epidermal growth factor, maturation of oligodendrocytes (defined by process number and length) was enhanced in hyperthyroidism, suggesting a more mature state than in control animals.  Terminal erythroid maturation was significantly improved by adding human serum and thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine [T3]) to the differentiation medium. This resulted in highly synchronous differentiation of the cells toward enucleated erythrocytes within 6 days T(3) alone stimulated neural differentiation in a similar fashion as that seen with RA in both wtES and mES cells.  Thus, c-erbA/TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate: unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation.  The thyroid hormone receptor functions as a ligand-operated developmental switch between proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors. Thyroid hormones induce hemopoietic pluripotent stem cell differentiation toward erythropoiesis 	['Thyroid hormone treatment of Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes attenuates the fetal gene expression and induces differentiation.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have raised the possibility that patient-specific insulin-secreting cells might be derived from somatic cells through cell fate reprogramming. We demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs might be ideal substitutes to induce pancreatic differentiation in hiPSCs. Pluripotent stem cells as a potential tool for disease modelling and cell therapy in diabetes. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs). ESCs and iPSCs have a great potential to differentiate into all cell types, and they have a high ability to differentiate into insulin-secreting β cells.  Several iPSC lines have been recently generated from patients with different types of diabetes, and most of these cell lines are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting β cells. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the differentiation of pancreatic β cells from PSCs, and describe the challenges for their clinical use in diabetes cell therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PDX-1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1), NeuroD1 (neurogenic differentiation-1) and MafA (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A) in the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into insulin-producing cells and to explore this new approach of cell transplantation therapy for type 1 diabetes in mice.  iPSCs were infected with adenovirus (Ad-Mouse PDX-1-IRES-GFP, Ad-Mouse NeuroD1-IRES-GFP and Ad-Mouse Mafa-IRES-GFP) and then differentiated into insulin-producing cells in vitro.  The insulin-producing cells we obtained from three-gene-modified EBs may be used as seed cells for tissue engineering and may represent a cell replacement strategy for the production of β cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. To date, the pathogenesis of diabetes is far to be understood, and there is no permanent treatment available for diabetes. One of the promising approaches to understand and cure diabetes is to use pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PCSs (iPSCs).	['One of the promising approaches to cure diabetes is to use induced PCSs (iPSCs) and to differentiate them into insulin-secreting β cells.

5e46fef23f54159529000014	What are the eRNA-producing centers (EPCs)?	Active enhancers in mammals produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are bidirectionally transcribed, unspliced, and unstable. Enhancer regions are also enriched with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts, which are typically spliced and substantially more stable. In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA-producing centers (EPCs). EPCs found very close to transcription start sites of lncRNAs exhibit attributes of both enhancers and promoters, including distinctive DNA motifs and a characteristic chromatin landscape. These EPCs are associated with higher enhancer activity, driven at least in part by the presence of conserved, directional splicing signals that promote lncRNA production, pointing at a causal role of lncRNA processing in enhancer activity. Together, our results suggest that the conserved ability of some enhancers to produce lncRNAs augments their activity in a manner likely mediated through lncRNA maturation.

5319a83bb166e2b80600002c	What is the use of emulsion PCR in Next Generation Sequencing?	Emulsion PCR-coupled target enrichment: an effective fishing method for high-throughput sequencing of poorly preserved ancient DNA We present a unified strategy in which emulsion PCR is coupled with target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing. The method made it possible to obtain efficiently non-duplicated reads mapped to target sequences of interest, and this can achieve deep and reliable sequencing of ancient DNA from typical materials, even though poorly preserved. Three multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to amplify the coding exons of 328 genes including FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. DNA fragments from different samples were ligated with barcoded sequencing adaptors. Template preparation and emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particles enrichment were carried out using an Ion One Touch system. The ion sphere particles were sequenced on a 318 chip using the PGM platform. In our NGS approach, the 16,569-bp mtDNA is enriched by long-range PCR and the 108 nuclear genes (which represent 1301 amplicons and 680 kb) are enriched by RainDance emulsion PCR. Sequencing is performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or MiSeq platforms, and bioinformatics analysis is performed using commercial and in-house developed bioinformatics pipelines. However, pyrosequencing of emulsion PCR reactions, amplifying from only one molecule at a time, can generate megabases of clonally amplified loci at high coverage, thereby greatly simplifying allelic sequence determination. During genomic PCR, in this 4-primer system, the outer set of primers containing the MID and the 454 adaptor sequences are incorporated into an amplicon generated by the inner HLA target-specific primers each containing a common sequence tag at the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Pools of the resulting amplicons are used for emulsion PCR and clonal sequencing on the 454 Life Sciences GS FLX System, followed by genotyping with Conexio software. The purpose of our study was to compare NGS enrichment methods for a clinical assay targeting the nine genes known to be associated with aortopathy. RainDance emulsion PCR and SureSelect RNA-bait hybridization capture enrichment methods were directly compared by enriching DNA from eight samples. We show the efficacy by comparing the method to a commercial kit and further demonstrate that emulsion PCR can be used for bias free amplification and virtual immortalization of DNA template libraries. Here, we describe a novel approach for normalization of multiplex next generation sequencing libraries after emulsion PCR. Briefly, amplified libraries carrying unique barcodes are prepared by fluorescent tagging of complementary sequences and then resolved by high-speed flow cytometric sorting of labeled emulsion PCR beads. The protocol is simple and provides an even sequence distribution of multiplex libraries when sequencing the flow-sorted beads. Moreover, since many empty and mixed emulsion PCR beads are removed, the approach gives rise to a substantial increase in sequence quality and mean read length, as compared to that obtained by standard enrichment protocols. Based on the mechanism of emulsion PCR, a unique DNA template would only generate a unique sequence read after being amplified and sequenced on GS FLX. Prior to SOLiD sequencing reaction, the libraries were amplified with emulsion PCR and enriched with the P2 enrichment beads. The library samples were loaded to sequencing Chip for Work Flow Analysis (WFA) or sequencing running with default parameters.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000006	What is the association between moon cycle and rupture risk  of intracranial aneurysms?	Recently, it has been reported that moon phases correlate with the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), however, another author found no such association.  We found no correlation between incidence of aneurysmal SAH, location of the aneurysm, initial clinical presentation, or amount of subarachnoid blood and the lunar cycle.  The moon influences neither the incidence of aneurysmal SAH nor the grade of initial neurological deterioration or amount of subarachnoid blood. We did not observe any significant impact of the lunar cycle on the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in 717 consecutive patients (p=0.84). The impact of the lunar cycle on aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is a myth rather than reality. An incidence peak for aneurysm rupture (28 patients) was seen during the phase of new moon, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The lunar cycle seems to affect the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, with the new moon being associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal SAH.

51492168d24251bc05000041	Which depression rating scales were shown to have acceptable psychometric properties for screening of poststroke depression?	The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD) (sensitivity: 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; specificity: 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (sensitivity: 0.84; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90; specificity:0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.90) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (sensitivity: 0.86; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94; specificity: 0.79; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90) appeared to be the optimal measures for screening measures. There are a number of possible instruments that may help in screening for poststroke depression but none are satisfactory for case-finding. Preliminary data suggests the CESD, HDRS or the PHQ-9 as the most promising options. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered. The balance of sensitivity and specificity was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Discriminating abilities of all the scales for major and all PSD were good (area under ROC values 0.88-0.93 and 0.88-0.92 at 2 weeks; and 0.93-0.96 and 0.89-0.91 at 1 year, respectively). We compared the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Visual Analogue Mood Scale, proxy assessment, and Clinical Global Impression of the nursing and study personnel, together with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, in assessing depression after stroke in a follow-up study of 100 patients. The sensitivity and specificity against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria were acceptable with the Clinical Global Impression, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, mostly in the range of 0.70 to 1.00. The Visual Analogue Mood Scale was not a sensitive instrument (sensitivity, 0.20 to 0.60) and did not correlate with the Beck Depression Inventory during the first year after stroke. Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Clinical Global Impression assessment by professionals, in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, are useful in assessing depression, but none of these instruments clearly stood apart from the others. Proxy ratings should be used with caution, and the use of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale among patients with aphasia and other cognitive impairments cannot be recommended. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS), a diagnostic tool specifically devised to assess depression after stroke, in comparison to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). At their optimum cut-off points, the Ham-D and PSDRS showed good sensitivity and specificity for MDL or MDL + MDDM; the PSDRS had a higher positive predictive value for MDL in respect of the Ham-D (78 vs. 59%). Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of the PSDRS was higher in respect of the Ham-D in aphasic patients. The Ham-D and PSDRS are both reliable diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of PSD. We suggest that the PSDRS could be a useful tool in clinical practice and in therapeutic trials. The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35.2%) patients as depressed. Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38.0%) and 18/30 (60.0%) patients as potentially depressed. The proportion of patients correctly identified as depressed by the test (sensitivity) when rated by nurses was 64%, and the proportion of patients not depressed who were correctly identified by the test (specificity) was 61%, whereas carers achieved sensitivity 90% and specificity 35%. The Signs of Depression Scale is easily completed by clinical staff, although we found the sensitivity when completed by nurses to be low. Information from carers shows potential to improve screening and it is important for nurses to value the knowledge and skills of carers in detecting depression following a stroke. Further refinement of the Signs of Depression Scale, with accompanying research, is required. The VAMS was not useful in screening for depression in Chinese stroke patients while both the HADS and the GDS demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. At their respective optimum cutoff values, the sensitivity of the self-rated scales varied between 80% and 90%, while the specificity was about 60%. For the observer-rated scale (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), sensitivity was 78.1%, and specificity was 74.6%. The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68% depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50% depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists). Although there were no marked differences in the screening abilities for PSD between the scales, differences were found in factors influencing misclassification. Assessment scales with less somatic items may be recommended for the screening of PSD, particularly at the acute phase of stroke.	['The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, The Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Poststroke Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scale appeared to have acceptable psychometric properties for identifying depression in patients after stroke. Therefore, these scales can be used for screening of post-stroke depression. Signs of Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Mood Scale showed inferior psychometric properties and therefore should not be used for screening for post-stroke depression.']

Spt6 is a highly conserved histone chaperone that interacts directly with both RNA polymerase II and histones to regulate gene expression.

Binding of elongation factor Spt6 to Iws1 provides an effective means for coupling eukaryotic mRNA synthesis, chromatin remodelling and mRNA export.

5e2903978b3851296d000007	Describe the mechanism of action of Luspatercept.	The method is a modification of a recently published protocol for Luspatercept (ACE-536, ACVR2B-Fc), another erythropoiesis stimulating fusion protein. They are dimeric recombinant fusion proteins composed of the extracellular domain of a human activin receptor (ActRIIA or IIB) linked to the Fc part of human IgG1. Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (a modified ActRIIB-Fc) in particular are now in phase 2/3 of clinical trials against anemia and included in the prohibited list established by the World Anti-Doping Agency.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sotatercept and luspatercept are recombinant soluble activin type-II receptor-IgG-Fc fusion proteins that are tested in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of anemias, including renal anemia.  Other newly developed ESAs - luspatercept and sotatercept, both activin receptor type II-Fc fusion proteins (ActRII-Fc) - are also now prohibited and could be used in combination with rEPOs.  Recently, activin inhibitors such as Luspatercept have shown to be effective in patients' refractory to ESAs and further clinical trials are ongoing to explore this further. Combined detection of the ActRII-Fc fusion proteins Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (modified ActRIIB-Fc) in serum by means of immunoaffinity purification, tryptic digestion, and LC-MS/MS. In particular, activin receptor competitors, such as the ActRII-Fc fusion proteins Sotatercept (ActRIIA-Fc) and Luspatercept (modified ActRIIB-Fc), have the potential for being misused as doping agents in sports as they were found to inhibit negative regulators of late-stage erythropoiesis. An example is luspatercept, an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-β signaling, thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis.

57169a49cb4ef8864c00000a	What is the mechanism of action of decitabine?	The use of the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine (Dacogen®) has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and its clinical effects on solid tumors have gained attention. low-dose decitabine and combined therapy show significant improvement in solid tumor treatment. Here, we demonstrate dose-dependent degradation of Dnmt1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing catalytic site mutant (cys-ser), confirming that the covalent bond formation between Dnmt1 and decitabine-incorporated DNA is not essential for this process. NMT1o, the oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the N-terminal 118-amino acid domain, did not undergo decitabine-mediated degradation, which further proves the requirement of multiple domains including nuclear localization signa Analysis of glycerol density gradient fractions of micrococcal nuclease-digested nuclei showed that both nucleosomal and nucleoplasmic DNMT1 are degraded upon decitabine treatment. The maximal effect caused by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) persuaded us to investigate further its role in decitabine-mediated DNMT1 degradation.  These studies provide substantial evidence that decitabine-induced degradation of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 does not require covalent bond formation with the substrate and also elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Decitabine is a potent demethylating agent that exhibits clinical activity against myeloid malignancies. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. Recent studies indicating that decitabine also induces regional chromatin remodeling of some unmethylated genes suggest additional mechanisms of action. Our findings indicate that decitabine can relieve p21WAF1 repression in AML by a mechanism that involves release of HDAC1 without requiring promoter demethylation. Numerous genes silenced by hypermethylation are reactivated by decitabine through a mechanism involving promoter demethylation with subsequent release of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and accumulation of acetylated histones. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) can relieve p21WAF1 repression in human acute myeloid leukemia by a mechanism involving release of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) without requiring p21WAF1 promoter demethylation. Decitabine, a demethylating drug, is the first-line treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and gains better overall survival, which is based on epigenetic mechanism Demethylating agent decitabine was reported to be able to up-regulate CTAs through its hypomethylation mechanism, thus enhance the immunogenicity of leukemia cells However, further elucidation of its mechanism of action is required, as clinical response to decitabine does not correlate with demethylation of the p15 gene promoter or the repetitive DNA element LINE.  In the area of epigenetic therapy, the demethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is increasingly used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but the mechanisms of its anticancer activity have remained unclear.

58cd633c02b8c6095300003a	What is known about telomere length shortening and stress?	A significant relationship between more perceived stress and shorter telomere length is consistent with theoretical frameworks positing that stress induces physiological changes that result in shortened telomeres.  Psychological stress contributes to numerous diseases and may do so in part through damage to telomeres, protective non-coding segments on the ends of chromosomes. Our results support the hypothesis that depression is associated with accelerated cell aging. Future studies are required to clarify whether the association is mediated through environmental stress, and whether effective treatment can halt cell aging. Telomere length, a reliable predictor of disease pathogenesis, can be affected by genetics, chronic stress and health behaviors. Cross-sectionally, highly stressed postmenopausal women have shorter telomeres, but only if they are inactive.

58a9d3cd396a458e50000004	What is Eteplirsen (Exondys 51)?	Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to induce exon 51 skipping that is developed by Sarepta Therapeutics. Intravenous eteplirsen has received accelerated approval from the US FDA for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is a therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that has been in development for close to two decades. This approach uses antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modulate pre-mRNA splicing of dystrophin transcripts to restore the disrupted DMD reading frame.  By the method of exon skipping in dystrophin pre-mRNA the reading frame is restored and the internally deleted but functional dystrophin is produced.  s, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, enabled dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 51.  Restoration of the open reading frame of the DMD gene and dystrophin protein production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be achieved by exon skipping using antisense oligomers (AOs) targeted to splicing elements.  We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. AVI-4658 is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) designed to induce skipping of dystrophin exon 51 and restore its expression in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

54fc58df6ea36a810c000004	What is the main biological function of the CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing system?	Mutagenesis and homologous recombination in Drosophila cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9. We have applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Drosophila S2 cells to generate targeted genetic mutations in more than 85% of alleles. By targeting a constitutive exon of the AGO1 gene, we demonstrate homozygous mutation in up to 82% of cells, thereby allowing the study of genetic knockouts in a Drosophila cell line for the first time. We have shown that homologous gene targeting is possible at 1-4% efficiency using this system, allowing for the construction of defined insertions and deletions. This technology enables controlled genetic manipulation in Drosophila cell lines, and its simplicity offers the opportunity to study cellular phenotypes genome-wide. The prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 type II genome editing system has recently been applied in cell lines and vertebrates. We now demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish is highly efficient, reaching up to 86.0%, and is heritable. The efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system further facilitated the targeted knock-in of a protein tag provided by a donor oligonucleotide with knock-in efficiencies of 3.5-15.6%.  The ease and efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with limited off-target effects make it a powerful genome engineering tool for in vivo studies. Cas9/CRISPR has been reported to efficiently induce targeted gene disruption and homologous recombination in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sequence-specific nucleases like TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have greatly expanded the genome editing possibilities in model organisms such as zebrafish. Both systems have recently been used to create knock-out alleles with great efficiency, and TALENs have also been successfully employed in knock-in of DNA cassettes at defined loci via homologous recombination (HR). Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. The type II CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) has recently emerged as an efficient and simple tool for site-specific engineering of eukaryotic genomes. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to transform genome engineering. We and others have recently shown that the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be employed to engineer the Drosophila genome, and that these modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline. Here we highlight the variety of genome modifications facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system along with key considerations for starting your own CRISPR genome engineering project. Here, we present a simple and highly efficient method for generating and detecting mutations of any gene in Drosophila melanogaster through the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated). Recently the type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) system has been adapted to serve as a targeted genome mutagenesis tool. This CRISPR/Cas9 system represents a highly effective and scalable gene knockout method in zebrafish and has the potential for applications in other model organisms. The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an efficient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing.

55479102f35db75526000004	What heterotachy states about molecular evolutionary processes?	One of the properties of protein evolution is the variation of the relative rate of substitutions across sites and over time, the latter is the phenomenon called heterotachy. Heterotachy is a general term to describe positions that evolve at different rates in different lineages. There is widespread evidence of lineage-specific rate variation, known as heterotachy, during protein evolution. Changes in the structural and functional constraints acting on a protein can lead to heterotachy Variation in substitution rates among evolutionary lineages (among-lineage rate variation or ALRV) has been reported to negatively affect the estimation of phylogenies. When the substitution processes underlying ALRV are modeled inadequately, non-sister taxa with similar substitution rates are estimated incorrectly as sister species due to long-branch attraction. Recent advances in modeling site-specific rate variation (heterotachy) have reduced the impacts of ALRV on phylogeny estimation in several empirical and simulated datasets. Heterotachy, the variation of substitution rate at a site across time, is a prevalent phenomenon in nucleotide and amino acid alignments, which may mislead probabilistic-based phylogenetic inferences. Heterotachy is a general term to describe positions in a sequence that evolve at different rates in different lineages. homotachy (i.e., the evolutionary rates within lineages in each of the concatenated genes are constant during evolution). Here, we examine how the violation of homotachy (i.e., presence of within-site rate variation, called heterotachy) distorts species phylogenies. The rate at which a given site in a gene sequence alignment evolves over time may vary. This phenomenon--known as heterotachy--can bias or distort phylogenetic trees inferred from models of sequence evolution that assume rates of evolution are constant. The evolutionary rate at a given homologous position varies across time. When sufficiently pronounced, this phenomenon - called heterotachy - may produce artefactual phylogenetic reconstructions under the commonly used models of sequence evolution. Rate-across-site (RAS) models are commonly used evolutionary models in phylogenetic studies. These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). The rate of evolution varies spatially along genomes and temporally in time. The presence of evolutionary rate variation is an informative signal that often marks functional regions of genomes and historical selection events. There exist many tests for temporal rate variation, or heterotachy heterotachy, a phenomenon that corresponds to shifts in site-specific evolutionary rates over time. within-site rate variation (heterotachy) Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Gamma distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for "different speed" in Greek). Heterotachy occurs when the relative evolutionary rates among sites are not the same across lineages. Sequence alignments are likely to exhibit heterotachy with varying severity because the intensity of purifying selection and adaptive forces at a given amino acid or DNA sequence position is unlikely to be the same in different species. compare the evolutionary properties of homologous sequence positions in paralogs. It has been proposed that the positions that show switches in substitution rate over time--i.e., 'heterotachous sites'--are good indicators of functional divergence. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy. These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). However, recent work by Kolaczkowski and Thornton suggested, on the basis of simulations, that MP is less sensitive than ML to tree reconstruction artefacts generated by heterotachy, a phenomenon that corresponds to shifts in site-specific evolutionary rates over time. Evolutionary rates vary among sites and across the phylogenetic tree (heterotachy). The principle of heterotachy states that the substitution rate of sites in a gene can change through time.

5d3883a0a1e1595105000017	How is transcriptional elongation affected by nucleosome positioning?	Nucleosome arrays inhibit both initiation and elongation of transcripts  Both transcript initiation and elongation were inhibited, the extent of the inhibition being directly proportional to the number of nucleosome cores reconstituted onto the pT207-18 DNA templates. neither partial nor complete dissociation of the histone octamer is essential for transcription elongation through arrays of nucleosome cores in vitro. The high affinity of histones for single-stranded DNA observed in titration experiments performed using the purified (+) and (-) strands of the NX1 fragment suggests that nucleosome dissociation is not due to the formation of segments of single-stranded DNA by RNA polymerase in the elongation process These effects are especially pronounced on chromatin templates, where both transcription initiation and elongation are virtually halted. The inhibition of transcription elongation appears to result from a dramatic increase in premature termination of transcripts. By using this system, we show that BRG1, the enzymatic motor of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, is recruited to the positioned nucleosome in a transcription elongation-dependent manner and facilitates traversal of the nucleosome by RNAPII. in order to elongate their products, both DNA and RNA polymerases must be able to overcome the inhibition presented by chromatin  We suggest a three-step model in which nucleosome remodelers, general transcription factors, and the transcriptional elongation machinery are primarily involved in generating the nucleosome positioning pattern in vivo. The independent effect of lack of TFIIS on nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness supports the existence of alternative chromatin dynamics during transcription elongation.

Renal failure-associated calciphylaxis, also termed calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), is a life-threatening condition usually observed in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis or after renal transplantation Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA, calciphylaxis) is a rare disease predominantly in dialysis patients and associated with high mortality. Painful skin ulcerations and calcification of cutaneous arterioles characterize calciphylaxis <b>WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE</b>: Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially life-threatening cause of skin necrosis and is poorly recognized by clinicians in non-uraemic patients.<br><b>CASE DESCRIPTION</b>: We report five cases of warfarin-induced calciphylaxis in patients with normal renal function. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a well-described entity in end-stage kidney disease and renal transplant patients; however, little systematic information is available on calciphylaxis from nonuremic causes. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially life-threatening cause of skin necrosis and is poorly recognized by clinicians in non-uraemic patients. OBJECTIVE Calciphylaxis, a rare disorder typically affecting renal failure patients, results in vascular calcification with subsequent skin necrosis, gangrene, and often death from sepsis. Calciphylaxis is a metastatic calcification-induced vasculopathy that results in the occlusion of small blood vessels. Calciphylaxis is a small vessel vasculopathy, characterized by medial wall calcification that develops in a few patients with chronic renal failure. BACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Calciphylaxis is characterized by painful, violaceous, mottled skin lesions (livedo reticularis) that may progress to tissue necrosis, nonhealing ulcers, gangrene, and potentially amputation, sepsis, or death. Calciphylaxis is a relatively rare disease, observed mainly in patients on dialysis, associated with high mortality rates, and characterized by painful skin ulceration. Calciphylaxis is a rare condition of induced systemic hypersensitivity in which tissues respond to appropriate challenging agents with a sudden local calcification. It is characterized by acute calcium deposition in the medial layer of small and intermediate dermal vasculature that can lead to epidermal ischemia, ulceration, and necrosis Calciphylaxis is a rare condition characterized by medial calcification of small- and medium-sized vessels that subsequently leads to ischemic necrosis. Calciphylaxis is a disease in which metastatic calcification affects small- and medium-sized vessels resulting in significant dermatologic manifestations. Calciphylaxis is a severe complication of chronic renal failure, confined almost exclusively to patients on dialysis therapy. Histological characteristics of calciphylaxis include small-vessel calcifications of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and visceral organs. These vascular changes promote tissue ischemia that often results in tissue necrosis Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy, also named calciphylaxis, is a rare but serious disorder characterized by medial mural calcification of small vessel leading to tissue ischaemia.  Calciphylaxis is a rare complication that occurs in 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) each year. Extensive microvascular calcification and occlusion/thrombosis lead to violaceous skin lesions, which progress to nonhealing ulcers with secondary infection, often leading to sepsis and death.  Calciphylaxis is a rare, usually fatal vasculopathic disorder characterized by cutaneous ischemia and necrosis due to calcification of arterioles Calciphylaxis is a rare and potentially fatal complication of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with abnormal calcium metabolism.  Calciphylaxis causes calcification, thrombosis, cutaneous ischemia, and necrosis in the skin and subcutaneous tissue Calciphylaxis is a rare phenomenon of medium- and small-vessel calcifications leading to cutaneous necrosis mimicking vasculitis.  Calciphylaxis combines features of vascular thrombotic occlusion and endoluminal calcification. I Calciphylaxis refers to a syndrome of calcium deposition in the small and intermediate dermal vasculature which can lead to epidermal ischaemia, ulceration and necrosis.

516e5f4e298dcd4e51000080	What is the effect of SAHA treatment in Huntington's disease?	Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, ameliorates motor deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors, we have conducted preclinical trials with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, in the R6/2 HD mouse model. We show that SAHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases histone acetylation in the brain SAHA dramatically improved the motor impairment in R6/2 mice, clearly validating the pursuit of this class of compounds as HD therapeutics. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, protects dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin-induced damage Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was the first HDAC inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the sole use of cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential new indications of SAHA for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases in in vitro Parkinson's disease models The novel neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of SAHA demonstrated in this study suggest that further study of this HDAC inhibitor could provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases SAHA displayed dose- and time-dependent prolongation of the survival and protection against neurotoxin-induced neuronal death of dopaminergic neurons neuroprotective effects of SAHA were mediated in part by promoting release of neurotrophic factors from astroglia through inhibition of histone deacetylation	['Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, protects dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin-induced damage.

52fa74252059c6d71c00005b	Why are insulators necessary in gene therapy vectors?	hromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2 motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the "core", which provide enhancer blocking activity and reduce position effects. An attractive solution to the problem of oncogene activation is the inclusion of insulators/enhancer-blockers in the viral vectors. We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects. Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin. The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.	['a) They inhibit oncogene activation upon vector integration and b) They maximize the probability of vector expression upon integration in heterochromatinic regions', 'The presence of insulators in gene therapy vectors is necessary because these elements have the ability to help overcome the problem of position effects, caused due to random integration of the therapeutic genes in the host cell genome.']

51751ee48ed59a060a000025	How are thyroid hormones involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?	Diabetic animals developed low triiodothyronine syndrome. They also showed that diabetes during the final 8 weeks (i) caused a marked impairment in the performance of perfused hearts ex vivo of hypertensive rats but had no measurable effect in the normotensive WKY, (ii) had no effect on arterial pressure of either the normotensive or the hypertensive rats but reduced heart rate of hypertensive animals in vivo, and (iii) caused equivalent hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and hypothyroidism (depressed serum T3 and T4 levels) of hypertensive and normotensive rats. Treatment of diabetic RVH rats with T3 (10 micrograms.kg-1.day-1) in vivo was nearly as effective as insulin therapy (10 U.kg-1.day-1) in preventing the cardiac dysfunction ex vivo and was as effective as insulin therapy in preventing the bradycardia in vivo and the decline loss the diabetic state in rats is associated with lowered T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 levels Thyroid status of diabetic animals was normalized by T3 alone or in combination with myo-inositol but not by myo-inositol alone. T3 treatment alone did not prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. Untreated diabetic rats exhibited a decrease in spontaneous heart rate and myocardial cytochrome c concentrations concurrent with depressed plasma T3 values compared with untreated controls. T3 treatment did not improve in vitro cardiac performance (assessed as cardiac output times peak systolic pressure per gram dry heart weight) in hearts from diabetic rats perfused with glucose alone. Addition of octanoate reversed this depression and improved cardiac function to a greater extent in treated than in untreated diabetic animals. As triiodothyronine (T3) treatment has been shown to normalize depression of cardiac myosin ATPase in diabetic rats While diabetic rats treated with T3 alone did not show significant improvement of myocardial function when compared with untreated diabetics, the function of those treated with both T3 and methyl palmoxirate was not significantly different from that in control rat hearts Although the plasma level of thyroid hormone was decreased in the diabetic rat, thyroid hormone treatment did not restore microsomal calcium transport in the diabetic animals.

530f72fd329f5fcf1e000003	What is known about depression in caregivers of brain tumor patients?	Data suggest that patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours often have a high symptom burden and unmet needs for palliative care, and symptoms are hard to diagnose; patients suffer often and early from cognitive impairment but are rarely appropriately prepared concerning end-of-life wishes. This reflects on their caregivers' burden as well Reports of caregiver depressive symptoms and anxiety were lower when paired with higher reports of spirituality. Fifty-nine percent did not receive any financial aid for home care, 33% had increased risk for psychosomatic problems, 45% had anxiety, and 33% increased depression levels. The caregiver's quality of life was most strongly affected by the burden of care (p < .001) and the patient's mental state (p < .03). Depressive symptoms are common in cancer patients and their family caregivers (FCs).  The psychological burden induced by brain tumor is profound both for the sick person and for their own family. This particular tumor not only impacts patients' quality of life, but also reduces seriously the caregivers' quality of life.  Most caregivers experienced more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as compared with patients.  Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and treat, if necessary, caregivers' anxious or depressive symptomatology that impacts their quality of life, making them more helpless, frustrated and less able to handle the situation of disease and caregiving situation.  Group-based trajectory modeling identified high-decreasing (51.1 % of caregivers) and consistently low (48.9 %) depressive symptom trajectories, high-decreasing (75.5 %) and low-decreasing (24.5 %) anxiety trajectories, and high (37.5 %), moderate (40.9 %), and low-decreasing (21.6 %) caregiver burden trajectories. High depressive symptoms were associated with high trajectories for both anxiety and burden, lower caregivers age, income, and social support, and lower care recipient functioning. Studies suggest rates of depression and anxiety up to 48% in patients and up to 40% in caregivers, with many unmet needs and dissatisfaction with health care provider communication and information.  Caregivers try to react to the illness of their relatives by mobilizing their physical reaction and growing their self-esteem, but they live with a clinically significant impairment of their quality of life, and experience a deep level of anxiety and depression.  There was a trend for economic hardship to predict CG depressive symptoms at 4 months (P = 0.09), but not at diagnosis. Although previous research has documented the stress, depression, anxiety, and burden associated with caregiving, when these conditions occur is not known. Among patients, 30% reported anxious mood and 17% depressed mood on the HADS, while corresponding numbers for carers were 40% and 10%, respectively.  Among patients and carers, 30% and 40%, respectively, reported anxious moods and 17% and 10%, respectively, reported depressed moods on the HADS. Significant correlations were observed between the FACT-G and HADS subscales, particularly emotional well-being and anxiety, as well as physical and functional well-being and depression, and between patients' and their carers' quality of life.  Findings showed a link between care recipients' problem behaviors and caregivers' depressive symptoms, a relationship that has not been well established in oncology.  Care recipients' neuropsychiatric status consistently affected caregivers' depressive symptoms and burden, and assisting with activities of daily living affected burden related to caregivers' schedules and health. 	["Depression is common affecting up to 40% of caregivers of brain tumor patients. Depression is associated with poor quality of life of caregivers of brain tumor patients.

ASSET: a robust algorithm for the automated segmentation and standardization of early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. The early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is an attractive model to investigate evolutionarily conserved cellular mechanisms. However, there is a paucity of automated methods to gather quantitative information with subcellular precision in this system. We developed ASSET (Algorithm for the Segmentation and the Standardization of C. elegans Time-lapse recordings) to fill this need. ASSET automatically detects the eggshell and the cell cortex from DIC time-lapse recordings of live one-cell-stage embryos and can also track subcellular structures using fluorescent time-lapse microscopy. Importantly, ASSET standardizes the data into an absolute coordinate system to allow robust quantitative comparisons between embryos. We illustrate how ASSET can efficiently gather quantitative data on the motion of centrosomes and precisely track cortical invaginations, revealing hitherto unnoticed differences between wild-type and saps-1(RNAi) embryos.

55032785e9bde69634000031	What is the association between NT-proBNP and cognitive function?	RESULTS: Measures of cognitive decline were significantly associated with stroke, NT-proBNP, ABI, and cIMT, but not with nonstroke vascular events.  SCI was present at baseline more often in NYHA IV patients compared with NYHA II [odds ratio 2.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-7.51, P = 0.025], but it was not related to NT-proBNP levels.  Comparing extreme quintiles of NT-proBNP, subjects in the highest quintile were more likely to have reduced cognitive ability (within the lowest tertile of 'g') and 'possible' depression (HADS depression ≥8) (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70; p = 0.005 and OR 2.18; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.71; p = 0.004, respectively). Associations persisted when pre-morbid ability was adjusted for, but as expected were no longer statistically significant following the adjustment for diabetes-related and vascular co-variates (β -0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03, p>0.05 for 'g'; β 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, p>0.05 for depression scores). CONCLUSION: Raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly but statistically significantly associated with poorer cognitive function and depression. The prospective phases of the ET2DS will help determine whether or not NT-proBNP can be considered a risk marker for subsequent cognitive impairment and incident depression and whether it provides additional information over and above traditional risk factors for these conditions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with vascular disease and elevated serum NT-proBNP level had a lower cognition level, shorter survival time, lower renal function and a higher percentage of pathological brain imaging than patients with vascular disease and normal NT-proBNP level.  BACKGROUND: Natriuretic peptides have prognostic value across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases and may predict cognitive dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease, even in the absence of previous stroke.  In unadjusted analyses, all 3 cognitive function test scores were significantly associated with NT-proBNP levels (P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, education, hypertension, body mass index, exercise, alcohol use, smoking, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine clearance, and previous cardiovascular disease, elevated NT-proBNP levels remained independently associated with poor cognitive performance on MMSE (odds ratio [OR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.6; P=.02) and Trails B (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P=.01), but not Category Fluency (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.2; P=.19).   CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP levels were strongly and independently associated with poor cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. However, NT-proBNP level did not predict cognition as assessed by MMSE score.

52d946c798d023950500000a	What is clathrin?	Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a central and well-studied trafficking process in eukaryotic cells. We reported the first small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between the clathrin N-terminal domain (TD) and endocyctic accessory proteins (i.e., clathrin inhibition1). Tubulobulbar complexes are elaborate clathrin/actin related structures that form at sites of intercellular attachment in the seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis.  Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are formed at the plasma membrane and act as vectors for endocytosis. They also assemble at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but their exact function at this organelle is unclear.   Clathrin immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting showed increased immunoreactivity of clathrin protein in the placental tissues of mice treated with 20- and 50-nm gold nanoparticles; clathrin immunopositivity was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells.

532f06e6d6d3ac6a34000028	How does dabigatran therapy affect aPTT in patients with atrial fibrillation?	He had been started on dabigatran 150 mg twice a day about 4 months ago as an outpatient by his cardiologist. His prothrombin time (PT) was 63 seconds with international normalized ratio (INR) of 8.8 and his activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 105.7 seconds.  The aPTT assay is relatively insensitive to dabigatran, and normal aPTT results may be observed even with therapeutic dabigatran concentrations. The APTT values became prolonged under dabigatran usage and exhibited a remarkable diversity. Although major bleeding did not occur unless APTT was prolonged excessively, minor bleeding arose irrespective of the APTT values even within the range of the APTT values not exceeding 80s. Dabigatran led to a dose-dependent prolongation of the clotting times in coagulometric tests and influenced the majority of the parameters measured. Statistically significant interference could be observed with the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and PT/aPTT-based assays (extrinsic/intrinsic factors, APC-resistance test) as well as lupus anticoagulant testing. Although aPTT does not provide a linear response to dabigatran therapy, the presence of a completely normal PTT may exclude therapeutic dabigatran anticoagulation. Commonly available global coagulation time assessments (e.g. prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) are highly influenced by rivaroxaban and dabigatran but these assays are relatively insensitive.  The relationship between dabigatran plasma concentrations and activated partial thromboplastin time in healthy volunteers and patients (n=762) was best described with a combination of a linear model and a maximum effect (Emax) model, consistent with previous reports.  We found a wide distribution of APTT in NVAF patients under dabigatran treatment. High APTT might help screen for bleeding risks among patients under dabigatran, but requires future investigation.	['Dabigatran increases aPTT in patients with atrial fibrillation, although aPTT does not respond linearily to dabigatran therapy.']

Here we present Genomiser, an analysis framework that is able not only to score the relevance of variation in the non-coding genome, but also to associate regulatory variants to specific Mendelian diseases. Genomiser scores variants through either existing methods such as CADD or a bespoke machine learning method and combines these with allele frequency, regulatory sequences, chromosomal topological domains, and phenotypic relevance to discover variants associated to specific Mendelian disorders. Overall, Genomiser is able to identify causal regulatory variants as the top candidate in 77% of simulated whole genomes, allowing effective detection and discovery of regulatory variants in Mendelian disease.

Time since management, number of symptoms and comorbid medical conditions predicted anxiety, while depression was predicted by number of symptoms.  Depression (usually mild) occurred in 24% of the respondents, being significantly more common in prolonged postoperative headache patients.  Three patients had a depressive disorder in the preoperative assessment. Of the remaining 24 patients, nine (38%) had a depressive disorder at the three month check up. Deterioration of hearing was the only postoperative detriment associated with a depressive disorder (P = 0·024). All nine patients with a depressive disorder were women (P = 0·001), giving them a 69% incidence. Content analysis indicated that the majority of subjects experienced tiredness, depression, headache, and dryness of eyes and mouth in the postoperative and convalescent phases.  Treating physicians should be aware that as the number of acoustic neuroma symptoms increases, so may the likelihood of clinically significant anxiety and depression.

5c52c8b07e3cb0e23100000c	What is the contribution of ultraconserved elements in Australasian smurf-weevils?	Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) resolve the phylogeny of Australasian smurf-weevils. Here, we employ ultraconserved elements (UCEs) designed for beetles and a novel partitioning strategy of loci to help resolve phylogenetic relationships within the radiation of Australasian smurf-weevils (Eupholini). Despite being emblematic of the New Guinea fauna, no previous phylogenetic studies have been conducted on the Eupholini. In addition to a comprehensive collection of fresh specimens, we supplement our taxon sampling with museum specimens, and this study is the first target enrichment phylogenomic dataset incorporating beetle specimens from museum collections. We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group. For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs. We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns. Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci.

5319a73cb166e2b806000026	What is the mechanism of action of geldanamycin?	Geldanamycin (HSP90 inhibitor) Geldanamycin is an antibiotic originally discovered based on its ability to bind heat-shock protein 90. This interaction can lead to the disruption of heat-shock protein 90-containing multimolecular complexes. It can also induce the inhibition or even degradation of partner proteins dissociated from the 90 kDa chaperone and, eventually, can cause apoptosis, for instance, in PC12 cells. An Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, geldanamycin, inhibits luciferase reactivation demonstrating the importance of the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of E. coli Hsp90 during client protein remodeling. Unique proteome patterns were observed in HeLa cells treated with the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and were similar to the patterns induced by radicicol, a structurally different HSP90 inhibitor. the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein (Hsp) 90 is an important anticancer drug target because it maintains the conformation, stability, and function of many important oncogenic client proteins, including those involved with signal transduction, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, motility angiogenesis, and metastasis. Using the standard inhibitors of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of Hsp90, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), novel solid-phase immunoassays have been validated using a time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) end point. Their utility for confirming the mechanism of action of Hsp90 inhibition in secondary cell-based assays has been shown and applied to the novel Hsp90 inhibitor CCT018159. A recent crystal structure of the NH2-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 established the presence of a conserved nucleotide binding site that is identical with the binding site of geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90. The functional significance of nucleotide binding by Hsp90 has remained unclear. Here we present evidence for a slow but clearly detectable ATPase activity in purified Hsp90.

5a7242a22dc08e987e00000e	Describe swirl sign in intracerebral hemorrhage.	Univariate analysis showed that the presence of extravasation on CT, large initial hematoma size (>30 mL), the presence of "swirl sign" on NCCT, the Glasgow Coma Scale and ICH scores, and international normalized ratio were associated with increased mortality. BACKGROUND: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.   61% of patients with swirl sign were dead at one month compared with 21% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Only 19% of patients with swirl sign exhibited favorable outcome at three months compared with 53% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p<0.001). Swirl sign was independent predictor of death at one month (p = 0.03; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 - 6), and functional outcome at three months (p = 0.045; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.02 - 6.5).CONCLUSIONS: As swirl sign showed to be an ominous sign, we recommend identification of this sign in cases of ICHs. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape.  Risk of evolution toward BD was classified as low (corneal reflexes present and no swirl sign), high (≥1 corneal reflexes abolished and swirl sign), and intermediate. Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p < 0.001). <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.

53173fc5b166e2b806000006	What is the Timothy syndrome?	A point mutation in the gene encoding Ca(V)1.2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). o circumvent this issue, we have developed a method using human-induced pluripotent stem cells to generate cardiomyocytes from individuals with Timothy syndrome (TS), a genetic disorder characterized by QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and autism. Two de novo point mutations of Ca(v)1.2 glycine residues, G406R and G402S, cause a rare multisystem disorder called Timothy syndrome (TS). Here, we discuss recent work on the mechanisms by which Ca(v)1.2 channels bearing TS mutations display slowed inactivation that leads to increased Ca(2+) influx, prolonging the cardiac AP and promoting lethal arrhythmias Timothy syndrome is a human genetic disorder due to mutations in the Ca(V)1.2 gene. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the CaV1.2 channel (CaV1.2-TS) that decreases inactivation of the channel, which increases Ca(2+) influx, prolongs APs, and causes lethal arrhythmias.  Recent reports suggest that parental mosaicism is involved in the heritability of type 1 Timothy syndrome (TS1), an extremely rare and life-threatening multisystem disorder characterized by severe QT interval prolongation, syndactyly, and several other complications.  Timothy syndrome, long QT syndrome type 8, is highly malignant with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare long-QT syndrome caused by CACNA1C mutations G406R in exon 8A (TS1) and G402S/G406R in exon 8 (TS2). Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism. Long QT, syndactyly, joint contractures, stroke and novel CACNA1C mutation: expanding the spectrum of Timothy syndrome. Timothy syndrome (TS) is an autosomal dominant condition with the constellation of features including prolonged QT interval, hand and foot abnormalities, and mental retardation or autism. Timothy syndrome type 1 (TS-1) is a rare disorder that affects multiple organ systems and has a high incidence of sudden death due to profound QT prolongation and resultant ventricular arrhythmias. In some rare cases, such as Timothy syndrome (TS), a specific mutation in a single gene can be sufficient to generate autism or ASD in most patients, potentially offering insights into the etiology of autism in general. Both variants of TS (the milder TS1 and the more severe TS2) arise from missense mutations in alternatively spliced exons that cause the same G406R replacement in the Ca(V)1.2 L-type calcium channel. A gain-of-function G406R mutation in a cytoplasmic loop of Ca(V)1.2 channels causes long QT syndrome 8 (LQT8), a disease also known as Timothy syndrome.  A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome. Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by cardiac, hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features. The two forms are type 1 (classic) and type 2, a rare form caused by mutations in a transcript variant of the same gene. Cardiac findings include a rate-corrected QT interval of between 480 ms and 700 ms and congenital heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Hand/foot findings are unilateral or bilateral cutaneous syndactyly variably involving fingers two (index), three (middle), four (ring), and five (little) and bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of toes two and three. Facial findings include flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, thin upper lip, and round face. Neuropsychiatric involvement includes global developmental delays and autism spectrum disorders. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is the leading cause of death, followed by infection and complications of intractable hypoglycemia. Average age of death is 2.5 years.  The gain-of-function mutations were found at two mutually exclusive exons in patients with Timothy syndrome (TS). These patients exhibit prolonged QT interval and lethal cardiac arrhythmias. TS patients also suffer from multi-organ dysfunction that includes neurological disorder such as autism and mental retardation reflecting the wide tissue distribution of CaV1.2 channel. Unexpectedly, TS patients may develop recurrent infections and bronchitis that suggests a role of CaV1.2 channel in the immune system. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease of excessive cellular Ca(2+) entry and life-threatening arrhythmias caused by a mutation in the primary cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.2). The TS mutation causes loss of normal voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 current (I(Ca)). During cellular Ca(2+) overload, the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias.  Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with the mutation of a Gly residue (G402 or G406) in the Ca(v)1.2 Ca(2+) channel. G406 is localized at the end of the IS6 segment and just before the intracellular I-II loop, which is important for the regulation of channel inactivation and the binding of the Ca(v)beta subunit. Inactivation of Ca2+ channel activity is perturbed in a rare yet devastating disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS), whose features include autism or autism spectrum disorder along with severe cardiac arrhythmia and developmental abnormalities. Most cases of TS arise from a sporadic single nucleotide change that generates a mutation (G406R) in the pore-forming subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel Ca(V)1.2. Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with QT interval prolongation and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. The syndrome has been linked to mutations in Ca(V)1.2 resulting in gain of function of the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)).

5a855585faa1ab7d2e000029	What is the origin of XUT transcripts in yeast?	XUTs are a class of Xrn1-sensitive antisense regulatory non-coding RNA in yeast Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions.  Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases.  Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated, locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Strikingly, antisense transcription was detected for most protein-coding genes, correlating with low sense transcription, especially when overlapping the mRNA start site. RNA profiling revealed that the resulting aslncRNAs mainly correspond to cryptic Xrn1/Exo2-sensitive transcripts (XUTs) Finally, we showed that asXUTs are controlled by the histone chaperone Spt6 and respond to meiosis induction, in both cases anti-correlating with levels of the paired-sense mRNAs, supporting physiological significance to antisense-mediated gene attenuation. Our work highlights that antisense transcription is much more extended than anticipated and might constitute an additional non-promoter determinant of gene regulation complexity. Antisense long non-coding (aslnc)RNAs represent a substantial part of eukaryotic transcriptomes that are, in yeast, controlled by the Xrn1 exonuclease. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear. We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates XUTs degradation by NMD, assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases. Single-gene investigation, genome-wide RNA analyses, and double-stranded (ds)RNA mapping revealed that 3'-ss extensions discriminate the NMD-targeted XUTs from stable lncRNAs. Ribosome profiling showed that XUT are translated, locking them for NMD activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated XUTs, suggesting that dsRNA unwinding is a critical step for degradation. Indeed, expression of anticomplementary transcripts protects cryptic intergenic lncRNAs from NMD. Our results indicate that aslncRNAs form dsRNA that are only translated and targeted to NMD if dissociated by Mtr4 and Dbp2. We propose that NMD buffers genome expression by discarding pervasive regulatory transcripts. Notably, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. XUTs are a class of Xrn1-sensitive antisense regulatory non-coding RNA in yeast. Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) destabilizes the Xrn1-sensitive aslncRNAs (XUT), but what determines their sensitivity remains unclear.

5a70e6e899e2c3af26000009	What is the mechanism of action of Fremanezumab?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The results of phase 2 randomized controlled trials for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine demonstrating the efficacy and safety of four mAbs targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway [ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab) and TEV48125 (fremanezumab)] have been published recently, and phase 3 trials are in process.  Selective Inhibition of Trigeminovascular Neurons by Fremanezumab: A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody. Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab (formerly TEV-48125) is a monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a validated target for migraine preventive therapy.  Fremanezumab-A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody-Inhibits Thinly Myelinated (Aδ) But Not Unmyelinated (C) Meningeal Nociceptors.  As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine. We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons. To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats. Discussion Clinical data from phase II and III trials of the four monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway: Eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, collectively show a positive effect in the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine.

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000b	What is the association between h-index and academic rank in academic neurosurgery?	 The contemporary h-index was found to be significantly predictive of NIH funding (p<0.001).  Bibliometric indices are higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without, but only the contemporary h-index was shown to be predictive of NIH funding.  However, when stratified by academic rank, a trend was observed showing greater mean h-index scores for those who completed fellowships.  Overall, being a senior faculty member corresponds with a greater h-index score, regardless of whether a fellowship was completed. There was a positive association between the h-index, academic rank, and years posttraining. Application of the h-index as a bibliometric in neurosurgery can distinguish academic productivity on the basis of academic rank, years posttraining, and neurosurgical subspecialties.  Overall, the authors conclude that the h index metric is a reasonable measure of academic productivity in the pediatric neurosurgery arena that provides a robust measure of an individual's contribution to the pediatric neurosurgery literature.  The h index calculation also reveals the productivity of the pediatric neurosurgeons to be on par with the productivity of neurosurgeons in general. The h-index frequency distribution conformed to both the log-linear variation of a power law (r                         (2) = .99) and the beta distribution with the same fitting exponents as previously described in a power law analysis of the productivity of neurosurgeons.  The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors being 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis; all groups significantly different from each other except the difference between instructor and assistant professor [Conover]). Departmental chairs had a median h index of 22 (range 3-55) and program directors a median of 17 (range 0-62). Plot of the log of the rank versus h index demonstrated a remarkable linear pattern (R(2) = 0.995, p < 0.0001), suggesting that this is a power-law relationship. The distribution of the h index within an academic population is described for the first time and appears related to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. As expected, the h index increased with academic rank and there was a statistically significant difference between each rank.  Within the field of academic neurosurgery, clear differences of h indices between academic ranks exist. On average, an increase of the h index by 5 appears to correspond to the next highest academic rank, with the exception of chairperson. Scopus h-index was of borderline significance in predicting physician salary (P = 0.12). 	['Greater h-index is associated with greater academic rank in academic neurosurgery.

5e48b7e2d14c9f295d000014	What is the use of erenumab?	Phase I, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single-dose, and Multiple-dose Studies of Erenumab in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Migraine. Erenumab was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile, supporting further clinical development of erenumab for migraine prevention. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention.  Conclusions As a preventive treatment of episodic migraine, erenumab at a dosage of 70 mg monthly significantly reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication use.

The addition of saponins to existing water supplies offers a new form of intervention into the cycle of rotavirus infection. We believe that saponins will 'coat' the epithelium of the host's small intestine and prevent attachment of rotavirus. The levels of antinutrients in meal from the raw seeds were: trypsin inhibitor activity (14.6-28.7 mg trypsin inhibited/g), lectin (25.6-52.2 unit; one unit is the reverse of minimum amount of mg meal/ml assay which produced haemagglutination), saponins (1.9-2.3% as diosgenin equivalent) and phytate (8.4-10%). Quinoa cultivars currently grown in North America and Europe require removal of bitter-tasting saponins from the grain prior to human consumption.  Antinutrients, including phytate, glycoside, saponin and tannin, were screened and quantified. Phytate (112.82 ± 0.1 mg/100 g), glycoside (2.33 ± 0.00 mg/100 g), saponin (1.31 ± 0.00 mg/100g) and tannin (0.21 ± 0.00 mg/100 g) were present in the fruit but phlobatanin and glycosides with steroidal rings were not found. antinutritional factors (phytic acid, trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) and saponins)	['Saponins are considered antinutrients for humans and have a bitter taste.

54d9071a4b1fd0d33c000007	What is the mode of action of bedaquiline?	Bedaquiline works by inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and represents the first novel class of antituberculosis agents in more than 40 years.  Bedaquiline has an entirely novel mechanism of action and so should be active against otherwise highly resistant organisms. It acts on the transmembrane component of adenosine triphosphate synthase and acts by preventing electron transport. Bedaquiline - The first ATP synthase inhibitor against multi drug resistant tuberculosis.  Bedaquiline is an anti-tuberculosis drug with unique mechanism of action. It selectively inhibits the mycobacterial energy metabolism i.e. ATP synthesis and found to be effective against all states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis like active, dormant, replicating, non-replicating, intracellular and extracellular. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bedaquiline possesses a unique mechanism of action that disrupts the activity of the mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate synthase.  By directly inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, bedaquiline is effective against both replicating and dormant mycobacteria.  Enhanced sterilizing capacity via synergistic depletion of ATP further exhibits the promising potential of bedaquiline with pyrazinamide.

56bcd422d36b5da378000005	What is the purpose of the Tokuhashi scoring system?	 Those referring to representative scoring systems about predicting the survival of patients with metastatic spine tumors were used. The significance and limits of these scoring systems, and the future perspectives were described. Tokuhashi score, Tomita score, Baur score, Linden score, Rades score, and Katagiri score were introduced.  BACKGROUND: We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems.  Accuracy of the revised Tokuhashi score in predicting survival in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). PURPOSE: The revised Tokuhashi score has been widely used to evaluate indications for surgery and predict survival in patients with metastatic spinal disease. CONCLUSION: We would conclude that although the predictive value of the Tokuhashi score in terms of survival time is at best modest (66 %), the fact that there were statistically significant differences in survival between the groups looked at in this paper indicates that the scoring system, and the components which it consists of, are important in the evaluation of these patients when considering surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the specific predictive value of the Tokuhashi scoring system (T12) and its revised version (T15) in spinal metastases of various primary tumors. Is Tokuhashi score suitable for evaluation of life expectancy before surgery in Iranian patients with spinal metastases? BACKGROUND: One of the most important selection criteria for spinal metastases surgery is life expectancy and the most important system for this prediction has been proposed by Tokuhashi. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive value of the Tokuhashi score for life expectancy in Iranian patients with spinal metastases one year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Present study showed that the Tokuhashi revised scoring system may be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring system for patients with spinal metastases in Iran.

55414e4f472cfd8617000002	What is known about MER41 repeat sequences?	We report eleven new families of MEdium Reiteration frequency (MER) interspersed repeats in the genomes of Primates, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha. Two families of the human repeats, MER 46 and MER 47, represent non-autonomous DNA transposons. These sequences are flanked by TA target site duplications and have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) similar to TIRs of DNA transposons. The sequences of five other families of repeats, MER41, MER48, MER50, MER51, and RMER3, resemble long terminal repeats of retroviruses. A potential involvement of some of the reported MER repeats in the regulation of transcription and genetic rearrangements is suggested. Age estimations place the origin of most MER repeats at the time of decline in MIR (Mammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats) retroposition and before the origin of the Alu family MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence that STAT1 binds to multiple distinct motifs upon interferon-gamma stimulation in vivo. While a large majority of genomic sites with high ChIP-seq signal is associated with a nucleotide sequence resembling a STAT1 binding site, only a very small subset of the over 5 million potential STAT1 binding sites in the human genome is covered by ChIP-seq data. Furthermore a surprisingly large fraction of the ChIP-seq signal (5%) is absorbed by a small family of repetitive sequences (MER41). The observation of the binding of activated STAT1 protein to a specific repetitive element bolsters similar reports concerning p53 and other TFs, and strengthens the notion of an involvement of repeats in gene regulation. Incidentally MER41 are specific to primates, consequently, regulatory mechanisms in the IFN-STAT pathway might fundamentally differ between primates and rodents. On a methodological aspect, the presence of large numbers of nearly identical binding sites in repetitive sequences may lead to wrong conclusions about intrinsic binding preferences of TF as illustrated by the spacing analysis STAT1 tandem motifs. Therefore, ChIP-seq data should be analyzed independently within repetitive and non-repetitive sequences MER41 repeat sequences contain inducible STAT1 binding sites.

56c097deef6e394741000027	What is the role of photodynamic therapy for meningioma treatment?	CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of 5-ALA PDT could be increased by adjunction of ciprofloxacin in conventional clinical dosing and by prolongation of ALA incubation time.  CONCLUSION: Gefitinib can inhibit ABCG2-mediated PpIX efflux from malignant brain tumor cells to increase the intracellular PpIX and thereby enhance the PDT effect. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT was more effective in killing U-105MG glioma cells than CH-157MN meningioma cells. These data indicate unique features of AlPc which suggests its application as a potent, non-toxic photosensitizer in the photodynamic therapy of human meningiomas. Photodynamic therapy is being investigated as an adjuvant treatment for intracranial neoplasms.  It was found that PDT using haematoporphyrin derivative as a photosensitizing drug showed dose-dependent activity against a variety of histological subtypes of meningioma.  Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells.  Susceptibility to 5-aminolevulinic acid based photodynamic therapy in WHO I meningioma cells corresponds to ferrochelatase activity. We conclude that differences in intracellular PpIX concentrations between HBL-52 and BEN-MEN-1 benign meningioma cells were mainly due to differences in FECH activity and that these differences correspond to their susceptibility to 5-ALA-induced PDT.

5549de44f35db7552600000c	By which mechanism MutT proteins act against DNA lesions in bacteria?	in addition to the well-characterized hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP at the α-β position, MutT cleaves at the β-γ phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the α-β position MutT also catalyzes the hydrolysis of 5-methyl-dCTP The common substrate structure for the functionally diverse Nudix protein superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The substrate specificity is known for less than 1% of the 29,400 known members. Most activities result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. the pathogen is exposed to reactive oxygen species, known to damage dGTP and GTP to 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, respectively. Incorporation of the damaged nucleotides in nucleic acids is detrimental to organisms. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. Here, we characterized MtuMutT1 and Rv1700 proteins of M. tuberculosis. Unlike other MutT proteins, MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP, and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GDP. Rv1700 then converts them to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. This observation suggests the presence of a two-stage mechanism of 8-oxo-dGTP/8-oxo-GTP detoxification in mycobacteria. A to C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency) Reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization and can lead to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Among the various oxidized bases, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine seems to be the most critical during the transfer of genetic information because it can pair with both cytosine and adenine. oxidized form of GMP (8-oxo-GMP) formed by the oxidation of GMP or by the cleavage of 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP by MutT protein. The 8-oxo-GTP produced in this way and by the oxidation of GTP can be used for RNA synthesis. This misincorporation is prevented by MutT protein, which has the potential to cleave 8-oxo-GTP as well as 8-oxo-GDP to 8-oxo-GMP. By hydrolyzing the oxidized guanine nucleotides before their incorporation into nucleic acids, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing organisms to avoid their deleterious effects. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP.  A-to-C mutations (a hallmark of MutT deficiency) Reactive oxygen species induce oxidative damage in DNA precursors, i.e. dNTPs, leading to point mutations upon incorporation. Escherichia coli mutT strains, deficient in the activity hydrolysing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), display more than a 100-fold higher spontaneous mutation frequency over the wild-type strain. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated opposite template A. Prevention and correction of oxidative DNA lesions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ensured by the DNA oxidative repair system (GO). Single inactivation of mutT, mutY and mutM involved in GO led to elevated mutation rates (MRs) the GO system (mutM, mutY and mutT) Human MTH1 and Escherichia coli MutT proteins hydrolyze 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP) to monophosphate, thus avoiding the incorporation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine into nascent DNA. Unlike other MutT proteins, MtuMutT1 converts 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGDP, and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GDP. MutT proteins, belonging to a class of Nudix hydrolases, hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. By hydrolyzing the oxidized guanine nucleotides before their incorporation into nucleic acids, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing organisms to avoid their deleterious effects. MutT-related proteins, including the Escherichia coli MutT and human MutT homologue 1 (MTH1) proteins, degrade 8-oxo- 7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) to a monophosphate, thereby preventing mutations caused by the misincorporation of 8-oxoguanine into DNA. In mutator strains lacking MutT and/or MutM proteins, 8-oxoguanine of DNA increased to a concentration expected from the increased rate of mutation. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains. MutT and MutY proteins, when active, protect bacteria from mutations induced by 8-oxoG lesions in DNA. MutT-related proteins degrade 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), a mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis, in the nucleotide pool, thereby preventing DNA replication errors. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains	["MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases.

59d09a0cbc32f93e6d000001	What is the difference between ganglion mother cells (GMC) and intermediate neural precursor cells (INP) in Drosophila?	 Neuroblasts (NBs) give rise to differentiated neurons and glia via intermediate precursors called GMCs or INPs. Expression of E(spl)mγ and m8, but not of dpn, depends on Notch signalling from the GMC/INP daughter to the NB.  A new role of Klumpfuss in establishing cell fate during the GMC asymmetric cell division. Studies in the Drosophila embryonic NB4-2 lineage have suggested that the transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu) functions within embryonic neuroblast lineages to differentiate between the identities of two adjacent ganglion mother cells (GMCs) Unexpectedly, in this lineage, klu is necessary for differentiating between the fates of the two neurons born from a unique GMC Additionally, our results demonstrate that Klu operates in the GMC and/or in the newly born neuron, but not in the neuroblast.  Neural progenitors of the Drosophila larval brain, called neuroblasts, can be divided into distinct populations based on patterns of proliferation and differentiation. In both vertebrates and insects, neurons typically arise from neural stem cells or terminally dividing intermediate progenitors. Each NB has a unique identity and undergoes repeated cell divisions to produce several smaller secondary precursor cells, ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each GMC divides once to produce two neurons and/or glia, thereby generating a specific lineage of neurons/glia. Type I neuroblasts produce ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that divide once to produce differentiated progeny, while type II neuroblasts produce self-renewing intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and thus generate lineages containing many more progeny. In the Drosophila CNS, neuroblasts undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions, whereas their progeny, ganglion mother cells (GMCs), divide asymmetrically to generate terminal postmitotic neurons. NBs divide asymmetrically to regenerate themselves and produce a secondary precursor cell called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides to produce neurons and glia. Each of the approximately 25 NBs per hemisegment undergoes repeated asymmetric divisions to produce, on average, 5-10 smaller ganglion mother cells (GMCs); each GMC, in turn, divides to produce two neurons. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. In the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, secondary precursor cells-ganglion mother cells (GMCs)-divide and produce postmitotic neurons that take on different cell fates. The bipotential Ganglion Mother Cells, or GMCs, in the Drosophila CNS asymmetrically divide to generate two distinct post-mitotic neurons.	['GMC divides only once to give rise to two post-mitotic cells (neurons or glia), whereas the INP can also self-renew, albeit for fewer rounds than a NSC, and generate GMCs']
53188c12b166e2b80600001a	What is the role of RhoA in bladder cancer?	Alterations in RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42 expression play a significant role in the genesis and progression of UCC of the urinary bladder. Published reports suggest that elevated RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling plays a role in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure, ejaculation disorders, prostate and bladder cancer initiation, and eventual metastasis. The suppressive effect of Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, on oncogenic Ras/RhoA induced invasion/migration of human bladder cancer TSGH cells Our results provide evidence that Ras-induced RhoA and NF-kappaB activation was involved in the invasion/migration of bladder cancer. Increased RHOA expression was more common in grade 3 than in grade 2 tumors (P = 0.016). RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK were more abundant in tumors and metastatic lymph nodes than in nontumor bladder and uninvolved lymph nodes (P < 0.0001). High RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK expression were related to poor tumor differentiation (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively), muscle invasion (P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier plots linked high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression to shortened disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001). By univariate analysis, high RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK protein expression predicted shortened disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001). Overall survival in tumors invading muscle (T2 to T4; 44 patients) was significantly influenced by RhoA, RhoC, and ROCK in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.01, respectively).	['In urinary bladder cancer, RhoA was more commonly found to be activated in the later stages of the disease. This activation was related to poor tumor differentiation, muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, and shortened disease-free and overall survival.']
54f1e887c409818c32000004	What is known about thalidomide therapy and survival of glioblastoma patients?	In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The authors previously reported improved outcome in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with thalidomide and irinotecan compared with historical controls.  CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and irinotecan did not achieve sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation against AG, although a subset of patients experienced prolonged PFS/OS.  The treatment regimen was well tolerated. OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT. The addition of celecoxib and thalidomide to adjuvant temozolomide was well tolerated but did not meet the primary end point of improvement of 4-month PFS from study enrollment. CONCLUSION: The combination of irinotecan and thalidomide has limited activity against GBM. The combination of irinotecan, a cytotoxic agent, and thalidomide, an antiangiogenic agent, shows promising activity against recurrent GBM in patients not receiving EIACs and warrants further study.  CONCLUSION: The administration of temozolomide in association with thalidomide after radiotherapy (RT) does not offer an advantage over temozolomide alone in adults with newly diagnosed GBM. The two therapeutic strategies produce similar results for survival, but the latter regimen shows a moderate increase in toxicity. CONCLUSION: This drug combination was reasonably safe, but with little indication of improvement compared to temozolomide alone. In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased. Experimental studies have demonstrated that thalidomide has anti-tumor activity mediated by blockage of angiogenesis, with clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma, glioblastoma multiforme, and renal cell cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy was relatively well tolerated, but there was no survival advantage compared with historical studies using XRT either with adjuvant nitrosourea chemotherapy, with TMZ alone, or with the combination of TMZ and thalidomide. PURPOSE: The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide have both demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy of combination TMZ, thalid and RT was relatively well tolerated with favorable survival outcome for patients with GM when compared to patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and similar to those who have received nitrosourea adjuvant chemotherapy. It is unclear the added advantage thalid has in combination with TMZ for this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and temozolomide in the treatment of GBM appears to be more effective than that of thalidomide alone with respect to survival, TTP, and neuroradiological documentation of progression, stable disease or response.  In conclusion, thalidomide induces modest side effects and it may be considered a valid therapeutic option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Thalidomide is a well-tolerated drug that may have some activity in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.  Eight patients were alive more than 1 year after starting thalidomide, although almost all with tumor progression.   In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thalidomide prolongs disease stabilization after conventional therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression	['Findings regarding clinical value of thalidomide in terms of survival in patients with glioblastoma remain mixed. It has been shown that thalidomide can improve survival of recurrent glioblastoma patients. However, other authors have not confirmed these findings. Furthermore, thalidomide did not improve survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and pediatric glioblastoma patients.']

Mycobacterial protein tyrosine kinase, PtkA phosphorylates PtpA at tyrosine residues and the mechanism is stalled by the novel series of inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase (PtkA;TK) activated by autophosphorylation; phosphorylates TP, which subsequently leads to increase in its phosphatase activity Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA).  Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylates Toll-like receptor 4 to dissociate MyD88 and Mal/Tirap, suppressing LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR) Selective inhibition reveals cyclin-dependent kinase 2 as another kinase that phosphorylates the androgen receptor at serine 81. Aurora A kinase phosphorylates Hec1 to regulate metaphase kinetochore-microtubule dynamics. Central to this regulation is Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to promote microtubule turnover. Protein kinases are known primarily for their ability to phosphorylate protein substrates, which constitutes an essential biological process.	['Protein kinases are enzymes that add a phosphate (PO4) group to a protein, and can modulate its function.']
5a003e0a966455904c000001	What is the function of the TFIIS transcriptional factor (Dst1) in yeast?	TFIIS, an elongation factor encoded by DST1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, stimulates transcript cleavage in arrested RNA polymerase II. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TFIIS can bind the Cdk8 module and SAGA in cell-free extracts Members of the SAGA and Mediator complexes are partners of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS. It is proposed that TFIIS and the Spt8-containing form of SAGA co-operate to rescue RNA polymerase II from unproductive elongation complexes, and that the Cdk8 module temporarily blocks transcription during transcript cleavage. TFIIS promotes the intrinsic ability of RNA polymerase II to cleave the 3'-end of the newly synthesized RNA. TFIIS and Rpb9 are essential when the cells are challenged with microtubule-destabilizing drugs; While TFIIS has a pronounced effect on transcription elongation in vitro, the deletion of DST1 has no major effect on cell viability. We propose that TFIIS is required under stress conditions and that TFIIS is important for the transition between initiation and elongation in vivo. The eukaryotic transcript elongation factor TFIIS is encoded by a nonessential gene, PPR2, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide location analysis reveals a role of TFIIS in RNA polymerase III transcription. TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II) Recent studies revealed that TFIIS has also a role in Pol II transcription initiation.  TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel class of targets. These data provide strong in vivo and in vitro evidence in favor of a role of TFIIS as a general Pol III transcription factor. Transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) stimulates RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II by allowing backtracked enzymes to resume transcription elongation. TFIIS is required for the balanced expression of the genes encoding ribosomal components under transcriptional stress. We discuss the effect of transcriptional stress on ribosome biogenesis and propose that TFIIS contributes to prevent a transcriptional imbalance between rDNA and RP genes. Here, we investigated the role of nascent transcript cleavage stimulation activity on the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity in yeast. TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II). A mild but systematic increase in RNA polymerase occupancy and a strict dependency on the transcript cleavage factor TFIIS (Dst1) also suggest a slower rate of translocation or higher probability of transcriptional stalling in this mutation. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s)..

5a86bf2efaa1ab7d2e000033	What is the mechanism of the auxin-inducible degron system?	Fusion of inducible degradation signals, so-called degrons, to cellular proteins is an elegant method of controlling protein levels in vivo.  The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system allows the rapid and reversible proteolysis of proteins of interest, and enables the generation of conditional mutants of budding yeast. Strategies that use ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest, such as heat-inducible degron (td) and auxin-inducible degron (AID), are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants. Auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology allows rapid depletion of proteins in animal cells and fungi, but its application to human cells has been limited by the difficulties of tagging endogenous proteins. The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast. Here, we thoroughly and quantitatively characterize the auxin-inducible degron in single yeast cells. We show that an auxin concentration of 0.25 mM is necessary for fast and uniform protein depletion between single cells, and that in mother cells proteins are depleted faster than their daughters. we introduce an easy and efficient method to generate conditional knockout cell lines based on combining auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.  Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. Other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the SCF degradation pathway, allowing us to transplant the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system into nonplant cells and use a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability. We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1 in plants, in fission yeast. RESULTS We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1 in plants, in fission yeast. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. inducible inactivation of a protein is a powerful approach for analysis of its function within cells fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle however previously published strategies for protein depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest the aim of this work was to construct a useful and powerful protein depletion system in shizosaccaromyces pombe we constructed an auxin inducible degron aid system which utilizes auxin dependent poly ubiquitination of aux iaa proteins by scftir1 in plants in fission yeast although expression of a plant f box protein tir1 decreased mcm4 aid a component of the mcm complex essential for dna replication tagged with aux iaa peptide depletion did not result in an evident growth defect we successfully improved degradation efficiency of mcm4 aid by fusion of tir1 with fission yeast skp1 a conserved f box interacting component of scf improved aid system i aid and the cells showed severe defect in growth the i aid system induced degradation of mcm4 aid in the chromatin bound mcm complex as well as those in soluble fractions the i aid system in conjunction with transcription repression off aid system we achieved more efficient depletion of other proteins including pol1 and cdc45 causing early s phase arrest improvement of the aid system allowed us to construct conditional null mutants of s pombe we propose that the off aid system is the powerful method for in vivo protein depletion in fission yeast. plants have evolved a unique system in which the plant hormone auxin directly induces rapid degradation of the aux iaa family of transcription repressors by a specific form of the scf e3 ubiquitin ligase other eukaryotes lack the auxin response but share the scf degradation pathway allowing us to transplant the auxin inducible degron aid system into nonplant cells and use a small molecule to conditionally control protein stability the aid system allowed rapid and reversible degradation of target proteins in response to auxin and enabled us to generate efficient conditional mutants of essential proteins in yeast as well as cell lines derived from chicken mouse hamster monkey and human cells thus offering a powerful tool to control protein expression and study protein function. the analysis of consequences resulting after experimental elimination of gene function has been and will continue to be an extremely successful strategy in biological research mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly drosophila melanogaster rna interference is used extensively as well in the fly exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses however the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or rna interference is started targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function to this end a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting tir1 a plant f box protein which can recruit proteins with an auxin inducible degron to an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin here we demonstrate that the auxin inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in drosophila melanogaster neither auxin nor tir1 expression have obvious toxic effects in this organism and in combination they result in rapid degradation of a target protein fused to the auxin inducible degron. isolation of a tight conditional mutant of a gene of interest is an effective way of studying the functions of essential genes strategies that use ubiquitin mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest such as heat inducible degron td and auxin inducible degron aid are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants however these methods do not work with some genes here we describe an improved aid system iaid for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in this method transcriptional repression by the tet off promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target protein by the aid system to provide examples we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors dpb11 and mcm10 dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid because dpb11 and mcm10 are required for the initiation of dna replication their tight mutants are unable to enter s phase this is the case for dpb11 iaid and mcm10 iaid cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin both the tet off promoter and the aid system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast therefore the iaid system is not only useful in budding yeast but also can be applied to other model systems to isolate tight conditional mutants.

54f0985994afd6150400001a	What is known about efficacy of the high dose intravenous ascorbate in the treatment of cancer patients?	Evidence suggests that IVC may be able to modulate inflammation, which in turn might improve outcomes for cancer patients. IVC may serve as a safe, adjunctive therapy in clinical cancer care. SIGNIFICANCE: Ewan Cameron reported that ascorbate, given orally and intravenously at doses of up to 10 g/day, was effective in the treatment of cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment.  RECENT ADVANCES: High dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).   CRITICAL ISSUES: Neither the selective toxicity of pharmacologic ascorbate against cancer cells nor the mechanism of H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity is fully understood. Despite promising preclinical data, the question of clinical efficacy remains.  BACKGROUND: Treatment for pancreatic cancer with pharmacological ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) decreases tumor progression in preclinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest pharmacologic ascorbate administered concurrently with gemcitabine is well tolerated. Initial data from this small sampling suggest some efficacy.  IVC treatments on all aggressive stage cancer patients showed the poor response of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The high dose intravenous ascorbic acid therapy affects C-reactive protein levels and pro-inflammation cytokines in cancer patients. In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. Recent studies have revealed the scientific basis for the use of intravenous (i.v.) vitamin C or ascorbic acid (ascorbate) in treating cancers, and raised the possibility of using i.v. ascorbate as a prooxidant anticancer therapy. Through the production of H2O2, pharmacologic ascorbate can induce some cancer cell death in vitro and inhibit a number of types of tumor growth in animal models. Taken together with previous studies, high-dose ascorbate has the potential to be a novel treatment option to hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Two popular complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine therapies, high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (AA) and intravenous glutathione (GSH), are often coadministered to cancer patients with unclear efficacy and drug-drug interaction. Ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) is one of the early, unorthodox treatments for cancer. The evidence upon which people base the use of ascorbate in cancer treatment falls into two categories: clinical data on dose concentration relationships, and laboratory data describing potential cell toxicity with high concentrations of ascorbate in vitro. Recently, high dose of ascorbate in cancer treatment has been reexamined. These data suggest that ascorbic acid may have benefits for patients with mesothelioma. Although, a couple of controlled clinical studies conducted at The Mayo Clinic did not support a significant benefit for terminal cancer patients after 10 grams of once-a-day oral vitamin C, other clinical trials have demonstrated that ascorbate may indeed be effective against tumors when administered intravenously. Both these regressions coincided exactly in time with intravenous high-dose ascorbate administration, and it seemed reasonable to conclude that this unconventional therapy must have been responsible for his excellent responses. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. In the 1970s, Pauling and Cameron reported increased survival of patients with advanced cancer treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C (L-ascorbate, ascorbic acid). In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients.

However, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment. Pharmacologic actions of ascorbate against cancer cells remain to be fully understood. It is thought that high dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide.

56eaf4e6107309bc2f000001	How are GRBs (Genomic Regulatory Blocks) defined?	Reporter insertions distal to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes Although gene order in hox and other gene clusters has long been known to be conserved because of shared regulatory sequences or overlapping transcriptional units, the chromosomal areas found through insertional hotspots contain only one or a few developmental regulatory genes as well as phylogenetically unrelated genes. We have termed these regions genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), and show that they underlie the phenomenon of conserved synteny through all sequenced vertebrate genomes. Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene.  We show evidence that GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters. GRB targets are genes with a number of unique features that are the likely cause of their ability to respond to regulatory inputs from very long distances Genomic regulatory blocks are chromosomal regions spanned by long clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements devoted to long-range regulation of developmental genes, often immobilizing other, unrelated genes into long-lasting syntenic arrangements. Specifically, we discuss the recently discovered genomic regulatory blocks which we argue are principal units of vertebrate genome evolution and serve as the foundations onto which evolutionary innovations are built through sequence evolution and insertion of new cis-regulatory elements. We show that these LD blocks contain highly conserved noncoding elements and overlap with the genomic regulatory blocks of the transcription factor genes HHEX, SOX4, and IRX3.  Using a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the fate of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and identify exonic remnants that have survived the disappearance of their host genes after whole-genome duplication (WGD) in teleosts, we discover a set of 38 candidate cis-regulatory coding exons (RCEs) with predicted target genes.  They are therefore functionally related to a number of key protein coding developmental genes, that form genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) with arrays of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) functioning as long-range enhancers that collaboratively regulate the expression of their target genes.  In this paper, we therefore systematically investigate the regulatory landscape around conserved self-transcribed miRNAs (ST miRNAs), with their own known or computationally inferred promoters, by analyzing the hallmarks of GRB target genes Based on these results we used both an elevated HCNE density in the genomic vicinity as well as the presence of a bivalent promoter to identify 29 putative GRB target miRNAs/miRNA clusters, over two-thirds of which are known to play a role during development and differentiation. Furthermore these predictions include miRNAs of the miR-9 family, which are the only experimentally verified GRB target miRNAs. A subset of the conserved miRNA loci we investigated exhibits typical characteristics of GRB target genes, which may partially explain their complex expression profiles during development. Developmental genes are regulated by complex, distantly located cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), often forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) that are conserved among vertebrates and among insects. We have investigated GRBs associated with Iroquois homeobox genes in 39 metazoans.  Integrating sequence conservation, gene expression data, gene function, epigenetic marks, and other genomic features, we provide extensive evidence that many conserved ancient linkages involve (1) the coordinated transcription of neighboring genes, or (2) genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) in which transcriptional enhancers controlling developmental genes are contained within nearby bystander genes. As most of them occur as clusters near potential target genes, the database is organized along two hierarchical levels: individual UCNEs and ultra-conserved genomic regulatory blocks (UGRBs).  Detailed synteny maps between the human and other genomes are provided for all UGRBs. Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region.

The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) genomic regulatory block (GRB) is one of the best functionally characterized examples, with several discrete enhancers reported within its introns, vast upstream gene-free region and neighboring genes (Lmbr1 and Rnf32).

54dc8ed6c0bb8dce23000002	What is known as Calcium Induced Calcium Release (CICR) and its role in cardiomyocyte contractility?	Cardiomyocyte contraction depends on rapid changes in intracellular Ca(2+). In mammals, Ca(2+) influx as L-type Ca(2+) current (ICa) triggers the release of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is critical for excitation-contraction coupling. Release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) induced by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal L-type Ca(2+) channels (CICR) in cardiac muscle cells has been implicated as a potential target contributing to anesthetic-induced myocardial depression.  It is well known that calcium-induced calcium-release in cardiac myocytes takes place in spatially restricted regions known as dyads, where discrete patches of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum tightly associate with the t-tubule membrane.  Calcium (Ca(2+))-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is widely accepted as the principal mechanism linking electrical excitation and mechanical contraction in cardiac cells. The CICR mechanism has been understood mainly based on binding of cytosolic Ca(2+) with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inducing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Waves of calcium-induced calcium release occur in a variety of cell types and have been implicated in the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.  Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) has been observed in cardiac myocytes as elementary calcium release events (calcium sparks) associated with the opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. In heart cells, a tight coupling between the gating of single L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) underlies calcium release.

5a43a933966455904c00000b	How may CTCF mediate splicing?	Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing. The first involves modulation of the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); the second involves the formation of a protein bridge by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) that recruits splicing factors onto transcribed alternative exons. Furthermore, we found mutations in the splicing factor SFPQ and in the nonclassic regulators of mRNA processing CTCF and RAD21.  We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin.   Many CTCF sites are also involved in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some time. TET-catalyzed oxidation of intragenic 5-methylcytosine regulates CTCF-dependent alternative splicing. Intragenic 5-methylcytosine and CTCF mediate opposing effects on pre-mRNA splicing: CTCF promotes inclusion of weak upstream exons through RNA polymerase II pausing, whereas 5-methylcytosine evicts CTCF, leading to exon exclusion. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives.  A chromatin code for alternative splicing involving a putative association between CTCF and HP1α proteins. Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1α and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1α and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation. CTCF also functions in RNA polymerase II regulation and in doing so can influence co-transcriptional splicing events.   CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. However, there was no correlation between the KTS+/KTS- splicing variants of WT1 and the methylation status of the CpGs of the CTCF binding site. CTCF-promoted RNA polymerase II pausing links DNA methylation to splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide	['Two different mechanisms convey DNA methylation information into the regulation of alternative splicing.

5162da97298dcd4e51000048	What are the functions of sorting nexin 27?	Knockdown of SNX27 by siRNA in HEK293 cells raised MRP4 expression on the plasma membrane, increased the extrusion of 6-[(14)C]mercaptopurine, an MRP4 substrate, and conferred resistance against 6-[(14)C]mercaptopurine. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is a 62-kDa protein localized to early endosomes and known to regulate the intracellular trafficking of ion channels and receptors. Finally, migration assays revealed that depletion of SNX27 from HeLa and mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells significantly decreases cell motility. We propose a model by which SNX27 regulates trafficking of β-Pix to focal adhesions and thereby influences cell motility. We found that SNX27a redirected part of 5-HT4(a)R to early endosomes. sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a recently described member of a protein family involved in intracellular trafficking, SNX27 co-localized with transferrin receptor-positive vesicles, pointing to its participation in T cell endocytic recycling. This protein is a unique member of the sorting nexin family of proteins, a group generally involved in the endocytic and intracellular sorting machinery These previously unreported results indicate that SNX27 is a participant in NK cell polarization, as a mediator or target of the mechanism. Like most sorting nexins, SNX27 possesses a functional PX domain that selectively binds the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and is important for trafficking to the early endosome. This is consistent with a role of SNX27 as a general regulator for sorting of membrane proteins containing a PDZ-binding motif, and its absence may alter the trafficking of these proteins, leading to growth and survival defects. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to the sorting nexin family of proteins, which participate in vesicular and protein trafficking. Similarly to all sorting nexin proteins, SNX27 has a functional PX domain that is important for endosome binding, but it is the only sorting nexin with a PDZ domain. These results identify SNX27 as a PDZ-containing component of the T cell immunological synapse, and demonstrate a role for this protein in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between SNX27 and DGKζ. Sorting nexins have been implicated in trafficking of proteins through endosomal compartments.

51659356298dcd4e5100005a	How do histone methyltransferases cause histone modification?	Lysine methylation of histones is associated with both transcriptionally active chromatin and with silent chromatin, depending on what residue is modified. Histone methyltransferases and demethylases ensure that histone methylations are dynamic and can vary depending on cell cycle- or developmental stage. This approach identified Txr1p as a histone methyltransferase in Tetrahymena thermophila and characterized the relationships of the Txr1p and Ezl2p methyltransferases to histone H3 modification. Histone methyltransferases catalyze site-specific deposition of methyl groups, enabling recruitment of transcriptional regulators. In mammals, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3, a modification localized at the transcription start sites of active genes, is catalyzed by six enzymes (SET1a and SET1b, MLL1-MLL4) whose specific functions are largely unknown.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by covalent modification of histones is important for germ line cell development. In mammals, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific histone methyltransferases (HMTases), such as G9a, SETDB1, and SUV39H, play critical roles, but the contribution of H3K9-specific HMTases in Drosophila remains to be clarified, especially in male sperm. By analyzing the distribution of histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a DCC-dependent manner.   Here, we found the epigenetic modification of the BZLF1 promoter in latent Raji cells by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), H3K9me2/me3, and H4K20me3.  Although DNA methyltransferases have been shown to interact with histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 27) and G9a (which methylates histone H3 on lysine 9), the relationship between DNA methylation and repressive histone marks has not been fully studied.  Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.  Histone H3-lysine (K) 4, H3-K9 and H3-K27 modifications in all these four genes were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in HCC cell lines.  The histone H4 N-terminal tail has long been regarded as a major regulator in chromatin structure and function. Gene transcription is critically influenced by chromatin structure and the modification status of histone tails. Methylation of lysine residues in histone tails is dynamically regulated by the opposing activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases. The SAS3-dependent NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex was originally identified on the basis of its ability to acetylate histone H3 in vitro. SU(VAR)3-9 like histone methyltransferases control heterochromatic domains in eukaryotes. Methylation of position-specific lysine residues in histone N termini is a central modification for regulating epigenetic transitions in chromatin. Each methylatable lysine residue can exist in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated state, thereby extending the indexing potential of this particular modification.  One of these modifications, histone lysine methylation, has been shown to be highly stable and to represent an epigenetic alteration. Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. Set9, a novel histone H3 methyltransferase that facilitates transcription by precluding histone tail modifications required for heterochromatin formation. Our results suggest that the methylation of histone tails can have distinct effects on transcription, depending on its chromosomal location, the combination of posttranslational modifications, and the enzyme (or protein complex) involved in the particular modification. Among the different groups of enzymes known to catalyze the covalent modification, the most recent additions are the histone methyltransferases (HMTases), whose functions are now being characterized.	['Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are responsible for the site-specific addition of covalent modifications on the histone tails, which serve as markers for the recruitment of chromatin organization complexes. There are two major types of HMTs: histone-lysine N-Methyltransferases and histone-arginine N-methyltransferases. The former methylate specific lysine (K) residues such as 4, 9, 27, 36, and 79 on histone H3 and residue 20 on histone H4. The latter methylate arginine (R) residues such as 2, 8, 17, and 26 on histone H3 and residue 3 on histone H4. Depending on what residue is modified and the degree of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation), lysine methylation of histones is linked to either transcriptionally active or silent chromatin.']

LRRK2 (dardarin) Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2 or Dardarin) are considered to be a common cause of autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson´s disease, but the prevalence of these mutations varies among populations. The leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2/dardarin) is implicated in autosomal dominant familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD); Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) (also known as PARK8 or dardarin) are responsible for the autosomal-dominant form of PD (Parkinson's disease).

56ae5a8a0a360a5e4500000b	How do HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants regulate fetal hemoglobin?	HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants modulate fetal hemoglobin via long-range MYB enhancers. Here, we determined that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants affect regulatory elements that are occupied by key erythroid transcription factors within this region. These elements interact with MYB, a critical regulator of erythroid development and HbF levels. We found that several HBS1L-MYB intergenic variants reduce transcription factor binding, affecting long-range interactions with MYB and MYB expression levels. These data provide a functional explanation for the genetic association of HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphisms with human erythroid traits and HbF levels. Our results further designate MYB as a target for therapeutic induction of HbF to ameliorate sickle cell and β-thalassemia disease severity.
