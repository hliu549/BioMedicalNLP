530cf4e0c8a0b4a00c000005	Which are the cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome?	Cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome include aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue. Aortic root dilation is a main criterion of the Ghent Nosology. Dural ectasia and the presence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) contribute to its systemic score. The typical cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome are aortic regurgitation with progressive dilatation of the aortic root, which may cause dissection and rupture of the ascending aorta, mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve regurgitation. To describe the clinical cardiac manifestations and temporal evolution of Marfan syndrome in children; to estimate the incidence of annuloaortic ectasia and mitral valve prolapse the presence of mitral valve prolapse, aortic root diameter, mitral and aortic valves regurgitation, and aortic enlargement during beta-blocker therapy Cardiovascular manifestations in Marfan syndrome. The major cardiac diagnoses were aortic dilatation (1/3) and mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation (2/3). Marfan syndrome is a hereditable disorder of connective tissue that causes several distinct cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, dissection, and aneurysm.

602822341cb411341a0000f8	Which factors contribute to the risk of very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease?	Somatic mosaicism and common genetic variation contribute to the risk of very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a heterogeneous phenotype associated with a spectrum of rare Mendelian disorders. Here, we perform whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis of 3.5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected. In five patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1). We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB. The mutation is present in ~70% of phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening infections. Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls; P < 4 × 10-10), and replicate this finding in an independent cohort of VEO-IBD cases and controls (117 patients and 2,603 controls; P < 5 × 10-10). This discovery indicates that a polygenic component operates in VEO-IBD pathogenesis. Variants in TRIM22 That Affect NOD2 Signaling Are Associated With Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Excessive deubiquitination of NLRP3-R779C variant contributes to very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease development.

51595fb0d24251bc0500009c	Proteomic analyses have revealed proteins associated with the triple-negative breast cancers. List some proposed proteins.	Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1. We present here our results, including a large cumulative database of proteins based on the analysis of 78 TNBCs, and the identification and validation of one specific protein, Mage-A4, which was expressed in a significant fraction of TNBC and Her2-positive/ER negative lesions. Proteomic profiling of triple-negative breast carcinomas in combination with a three-tier orthogonal technology approach identifies Mage-A4 as potential therapeutic target in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Further, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic and gene array analyses of these cells and identified potential novel markers of breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating features, such as lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), RAB25, S100A14 and mucin 1 (MUC1), as well as a novel 31-gene signature capable of predicting distant metastasis in cohorts of estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancers. he results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC. We obtained differential expression patterns for several glycolytic enzymes (as for example MDH2, PGK1, TKT, Aldolase1), cytokeratins (CK7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19), further structure proteins (vimentin, fibronectin, L-plastin), for NME1-NME2, lactoferrin, and members of the Annexin family. he expression of calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer. Proteomic analysis also identified high levels of IDH2 and CRABP2 and low levels of SEC14L2 to be prognostic markers for overall breast cancer survival. Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that alpha-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR. The expression of a selected group of high abundance and/or breast cancer-specific potential biomarkers including thromobospondin 1, galectin-3 binding protein, cathepsin D, vimentin, zinc-α2-glycoprotein, CD44, and EGFR from the breast cancer cell lines and in their culture media were further validated by Western blot analysis. his provided novel evidence for PMA regulation of the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleolar RNA helicase 2 and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M. Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G(2)-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-kappaB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential.

531d7430267d7dd053000008	Which are the drugs utilized for the burning mouth syndrome?	On average, treatment with placebos produced a response that was 72% as large as the response to active drugs. The concomitant prescription of tongue protector and AV is effective for treating patients with BMS. We suggest that a subset of patients with BMS may be a phenotypic variant of RLS and a trial of dopaminergic drugs should be given in patients with BMS who has a history suggestive of RLS or in a patient who do not show a response to usual therapies for BMS. The systemic administration of Catuama reduces the symptoms of BMS and may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. Topical clonazepam, which previous analyses of clinical evidence have shown to be the drug of choice for BMS, also proved to be the most cost-effective of the drugs analysed for this condition.

RIT may be a safe and useful method of AIT therapy in patients with low RAIU, in whom other treatment methods are contraindicated. Treatment consists in the use of a high dose of anti-thyroid drugs and steroids in an isolated form or in combination. the addition of lithium carbonate to the two other drugs resulted in a successful and safety therapy in controlling amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. lithium is a useful and safe medication for treatment of iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis caused by amiodarone. Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued.

51740da48ed59a060a000024	Which are the bioinformatics tools for gene structure prediction? 	The prediction of the complete structure of genes is one of the very important tasks of bioinformatics, especially in eukaryotes. A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence. This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into 'exon-intron' (EI), 'intron-exon' (IE) or 'None' (N) boundary classes. The proposed WPSS method poses efficient results compared with the performance of many methods proposed in the literature. SCGPred: a score-based method for gene structure prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Moreover, computational gene finding in newly sequenced genomes is especially a difficult task due to the absence of a training set of abundant validated genes. Here we present a new gene-finding program, SCGPred, to improve the accuracy of prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence. Therefore, SCG-Pred can serve as an alternative gene-finding tool for newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes. The program is freely available at http://bio.scu.edu.cn/SCGPred/. Incorporation of splice site probability models for non-canonical introns improves gene structure prediction in plants. We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy. Source code for the updated versions of GeneSeqer and SplicePredictor (distributed with the GeneSeqer code) isavailable at http://bioinformatics.iastate.edu/bioinformatics2go/gs/download.html.

Gene structure prediction from consensus spliced alignment of multiple ESTs matching the same genomic locus. Accurate gene structure annotation is a challenging computational problem in genomics. The splice site prediction tool (SplicePredictor) is distributed with the GeneSeqer code.

GeneBuilder: interactive in silico prediction of gene structure. In the case of low homology, GeneBuilder is still able to predict the gene structure. The GeneBuilder system has been tested by using the standard set (Burset and Guigo, Genomics, 34, 353-367, 1996) and the performances are: 0.89 sensitivity and 0.91 specificity at the nucleotide level. The computer program SeqHelp organizes information from database searches, gene structure prediction, and other information to generate multiply aligned, hypertext-linked reports to allow for fast analysis of molecular sequences. Identification of human gene structure using linear discriminant functions and dynamic programming. Development of advanced technique to identify gene structure is one of the main challenges of the Human Genome Project. A gene structure prediction system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition functions. Analysis of uncharacterized human sequences based on our methods for splice site (HSPL, RNASPL), internal exons (HEXON), all type of exons (FEXH) and human (FGENEH) and bacterial (CDSB) gene structure prediction and recognition of human and bacterial sequences (HBR) (to test a library for E. coli contamination) is available through the University of Houston, Weizmann Institute of Science network server and a WWW page of the Human Genome Center at Baylor College of Medicine. In the bioinformatics field, many computer algorithmic and data mining technologies have been developed for gene prediction, protein-protein interaction analysis, sequence analysis, and protein folding predictions, to name a few.

54cf705ff693c3b16b000014	List receptors of the drug Cilengitide	Cilengitide inhibits attachment and invasion of malignant pleural mesothelioma cells through antagonism of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide, an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development. As there is evidence for expression of the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin αv heterodimer with high specificity for αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of αvβ3 and αvβ5. Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy.  Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors. RESULTS: αvβ5 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas αvβ3 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 μg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines.  UW479 cells expressed only αvβ5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on αvβ3 inhibition. Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on αvβ3 expression and sensitivity to anoikis.  METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8).  The αVβ3/αVβ5 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model. Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.   Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence.  Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma. The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases.  We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of α(v)β(3) and α(v)β(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA.  AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting αvβ(3)/α(v) β(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques. For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ(3) and αvβ(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).   In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that αvβ(3)/αvβ(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases. Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma.  Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy. PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study.  In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors. Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3033-3040).  Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors. BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose.  Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist.  Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours. A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity.  This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2.  The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases	[['αvβ3 integrin'], ['ανβ5 integrin'], ['αvβ5', 'αvβ3']]

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer (BC) that does not express the oestrogen and the progesterone receptors and the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). The so called "Triple Negative Breast Cancer" (TNBC) represents approximately 15-20% of breast cancers. This acronym simply means that the tumour does not express oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and does not exhibit amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene.

5e30f8abfbd6abf43b000047	Which molecules are inhibited by Gilteritinib?	ASP2215 (gilteritinib) is a novel, dual FLT3/AXL inhibitor with promising early phase trial data (NCT02014558).  Ex vivo exposure (n = 30) to FLT3 inhibitors, in particular to the FLT3-specific inhibitor gilteritinib, showed that colony-forming capacity was significantly more reduced in FLT3-ITD-AR ≥ 0.5 compared with ITD-AR-low and ITD- patient samples (P < .001).  Furthermore, overexpression of Pim-1 in 32D/TKD enhanced the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway and partially protected it from the PI3K/Akt inhibitors or the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib to confer the resistance to PI3K/Akt inhibitors.  Finally, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 80 patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed/refractory AML participating in a trial of a novel FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, and demonstrated a relationship between the mutation burden, as detected by the assay, and overall survival.  Gilteritinib, a novel, highly specific, potent fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/AXL inhibitor, demonstrated antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Combinations of an AXL inhibitor, cabozantinib or gilteritinib, and an EGFR-TKI were more effective against HCC78R cells than monotherapy with an EGFR-TKI or AXL inhibitor.  Internal tandem duplication (ITD) in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Quizartinib, gilteritinib, and midostaurin are inhibitors against FLT3-ITD that have good efficacy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients.  In this review, we summarized the preclinical and clinical studies on new FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib, lestaurtinib, sunitinib, tandutinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib, crenolanib, cabozantinib, Sel24-B489, G-749, AMG 925, TTT-3002, and FF-10101.

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

Gilteritinib, a FLT3/AXL inhibitor, shows antileukemic activity in mouse models of FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. The studies reported here evaluated the ability of a novel FLT3/AXL inhibitor, gilteritinib, to block mutated FLT3 in cellular and animal models of AML. Initial kinase studies showed that gilteritinib, a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly selective for both FLT3 and AXL while having weak activity against c-KIT. The decreased FLT3 activity and high intratumor distribution of gilteritinib translated to tumor regression and improved survival in xenograft and intra-bone marrow transplantation models of FLT3-driven AML. These results indicate that gilteritinib may be an important next-generation FLT3 inhibitor for use in the treatment of FLT3 mutation-positive AML. Gilteritinib (Xospata®) is an orally available small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Astellas Pharma in collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) harbouring FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations.

5a7238d32dc08e987e000009	Which two cotransporters are inhibited by sotagliflozin?	The present study used molecular docking by Autodock4.2 using our "Click-By-Click"-protocol, Ligplot1.4.3 and "change in accessible surface area (ΔASA)-calculations" to investigate the binding of two investigational anti-diabetic drugs, Ertugliflozin and Sotagliflozin to an established target (SGLT2) and a research target (human brain AChE). SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin and sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/SGLT2 dual inhibitor) also have a mild or moderate intestinal and renal SGLT1 inhibitory effect because of their relatively weak selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. Hydrogen-bonded structures and interaction energies in two forms of the SGLT-2 inhibitor sotagliflozin. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin, an oral inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2, in combination with insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Phase 2 studies with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagliflozin, which acts in the gut and the kidney, have demonstrated reductions in A1C, weight, and glucose variability without an increased incidence of hypoglycemia. Sotagliflozin may meet this need, because this compound lowers blood glucose through the insulin-independent mechanisms of inhibiting kidney SGLT2 and intestinal SGLT1.  AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors focus specifically on sotagliflozin (LX4211), the first-in-class dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. Despite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies.  Therefore, sotagliflozin (LX4211) has been developed as a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2.  Sotagliflozin, a Dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibitor, as Adjunct Therapy to Insulin in Type 1 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of dual sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin as adjunct therapy to insulin in type 1 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We treated 33 patients with sotagliflozin, an oral dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind trial assessing safety, insulin dose, glycemic control, and other metabolic parameters over 29 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunct to insulin, dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin improved glycemic control and the CGM profile with bolus insulin dose reduction, weight loss, and no increased hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes.

54f431d664850a5854000006	Which are the genes responsible for Dyskeratosis Congenita?	Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2) Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome with seven disease-causing genes identified to date, six of which are linked to telomere maintenance. Mutations in one of these genes (TINF2), which encodes a component of the shelterin complex, are associated with particularly short telomeres Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inheritable bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation, dystrophic nails and oral leukoplakia Four genes, namely DKC1 (codes for dyskerin), TERC and TERT (code for telomerase) and NOP10, have been implicated in the pathogenesis To date, CTC1, DKC1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, NHP2, NOP10, and WRAP53 are the genes in which mutations are known to cause DC and result in very short telomeres The mode of inheritance of DC varies by gene: DKC1 (X-linked), TERC and TINF2 (autosomal dominant), TERT (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive), CTC1, WRAP53, NHP2, and NOP10 (autosomal recessive) Six genes have been identified, defects in which cause different genetic subtypes (X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive) of DC. The products of these genes encode components that are critical for telomere maintenance; either because they are core constituents of telomerase (dyskerin, TERC, TERT, NOP10 and NHP2) or are part of the shelterin complex that protects the telomeric end (TIN2) BACKGROUND: Telomerase complex genes mutations (DKC1, TERC, TERT, and NOP10) lead to premature telomere shortening and are responsible for different forms of dyskeratosis congenita. Mutations in DKC1 gene encoding dyskerin are responsible for the X-linked dyskeratosis congenita. The DC1 gene responsible for the X linked form (MIM 305000) of dyskeratosis congenita has been mapped to Xq28. The DC1 gene responsible for the X linked form (MIM 305000) of dyskeratosis congenita has been mapped to Xq28 Mutations in DKC1 gene encoding dyskerin are responsible for the X-linked dyskeratosis congenita Mutations in the DKC1 gene are responsible for causing X-linked recessive dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) and a more severe allelic variant of the disease, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome Telomerase complex genes mutations (DKC1, TERC, TERT, and NOP10) lead to premature telomere shortening and are responsible for different forms of dyskeratosis congenita Linkage analysis in multiplex families confirmed that the DKC1 gene, responsible for the X-linked form of DC, is located within Xq28 and facilitated its positional cloning DKC1 has been identified as the gene responsible for X-linked DC, and genetic analyses have been performed in a worldwide study	[['DKC1'], ['TERC'], ['TERT'], ['NOP10'], ['NHP2'], ['TIN2'], ['C16orf57'], ['TCAB1']]

5c88550075a4a5d219000008	List 3 apoE mimetics.	Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability.  Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2).  ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors.

5539029cbc4f83e828000012	Which genes are thought to be involved in medulloblastoma development?	Medulloblastomas, the most frequent malignant brain tumours affecting children, comprise at least 4 distinct clinicogenetic subgroups. Aberrant sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling is observed in approximately 25% of tumours and defines one subgroup. Although alterations in SHH pathway genes (e.g. PTCH1, SUFU) are observed in many of these tumours, high throughput genomic analyses have identified few other recurring mutations Mutagenesis significantly increased medulloblastoma frequency and identified 17 candidate cancer genes, including orthologs of genes somatically mutated (PTEN, CREBBP) or associated with poor outcome (PTEN, MYT1L) in the human disease. Strikingly, these candidate genes were enriched for transcription factors (p=2x10-5), the majority of which (6/7; Crebbp, Myt1L, Nfia, Nfib, Tead1 and Tgif2) were linked within a single regulatory network enriched for genes associated with a differentiated neuronal phenotype Igf2, previously implicated in medulloblastoma, was the most differentially expressed gene in murine tumours with network perturbation PCDH10 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene in medulloblastoma The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progression We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were associated with significantly decreased patient survival Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's expression and survival in children with medulloblastoma Bmi1 is required for Hedgehog pathway-driven medulloblastoma expansion These data provide the first demonstration that Bmi1 is required for spontaneous de novo development of a solid tumor arising in the brain, suggest a crucial role for Bmi1-dependent, nestin-expressing progenitor cells in medulloblastoma expansion, and implicate Bmi1 as a key factor required for Hh pathway-driven tumorigenesis Genomic amplification of orthodenticle homologue 2 in medulloblastomas Genomic alterations normally associated with medulloblastomas, including MYC amplification and isochromosome 17q, were easily detected. Surprisingly, analysis of only five genomes revealed novel amplicons on chromosome 14q, one of which contained the orthodenticle homologue 2 (OTX2) homeobox gene. DNA copy number analysis showed that OTX2 had undergone genomic amplification in 2 of 11 medulloblastoma cell lines and 8 of 42 primary tumors Serial analysis of gene expression of 240 different human tumors or normal tissues revealed that 96% of all 783 OTX2 transcripts sequenced were in medulloblastomas or embryonic stem cells OTX2 functions to specify the fate of neuroectoderm in various regions of the developing brain. This developmental role is consistent with the evidence suggesting that OTX2 is a medulloblastoma oncogene Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella) In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum These data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis Biallelic epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma development Seventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG island Hypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine Epigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma RASSF1A hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological variants and age and sex groupings Medulloblastoma, a brain tumor, develops in about 3% of NBCCS patients, and mutations in PTCH have also been described in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomas Recently, a transgenic mouse hemizygous for the Ptch gene was generated by homologous recombination. Medulloblastomas were found in about 19% of these mice within the first 25 weeks after birth We also examined the mRNA expression levels for the remaining Ptch allele, as well as for Gli1, a gene known to be transcriptionally activated by Ptch inactivation. Blot analysis of RNA from the 13 tumors shows that Ptch mRNA of appropriate size is expressed in all tumors at varying levels. Expression of Gli1 was increased in tumors compared to normal cerebellum. These results suggest that deletion of one copy of Ptch may be sufficient to promote medulloblastoma development in mice	[['PTCH1'], ['SUFU'], ['PTEN'], ['CREBBP'], ['PTEN'], ['MYT1L'], ['NFIA'], ['NFIB'], ['TEAD1'], ['TGIF2'], ['IGF2'], ['PCDH10'], ['BMI1'], ['MYC'], ['OTX2'], ['RASSF1A'], ['HIC1'], ['CASP8']]

531b3ff3b166e2b80600003d	Which proteins are related to the loss of cell-cell adhesion during EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)?	conserved polarity proteins Par6 and aPKC regulate cell polarization processes  In addition to signaling pathways that alter genetic programes that trigger the loss of cell-cell adhesion, alternative pathways can alter cell plasticity to regulate cell-cell cohesion and increase invasive potential One such pathway involves TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Par6 Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1 We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT Numb has been shown to play an important role in the proper functions of Par protein complex and in cell-cell junctions, both of which are associated with EMT Recently, we showed that Numb is capable of binding to both Par3 and E-cadherin Knockdown of Numb by shRNA in MDCK cells led to a lateral to apical translocation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, active F-actin polymerization, mis-localization of Par3 and aPKC, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and an increase in cell migration and proliferation This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1. EGF induces EMT in the breast cancer cell line PMC42-LA and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (ST) induces EMT in embryonic neural epithelial cells, with F-actin de-bundling and disruption of cell-cell adhesion, via inhibition of aPKC ST in combination with EGF directed a greater EMT via actin depolymerisation and focal contact size reduction, resulting in a loosening of cell-ECM attachment along with Snail1-Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT unctional loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is an essential event for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and tumour invasion Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by several inducers of EMT, in particular the ZEB and Snail factors, downregulate the expression and/or functional organization of core polarity complexes TGFbeta has pleiotropic effects that range from regulation of proliferation and apoptosis to morphological changes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) Morphological changes were accompanied by decrease in E-cadherin and increased Snail expression but the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, SMAalpha and Vimentin) studied remained unchanged Neutralising E-cadherin function promoted the invasion and inhibited the aggregation of endocrine-sensitive MCF7 cells, whilst having little effect on the behaviour of TamR cells	[['ZEB'], ['SNAIL'], ['SIRT1'], ['EGF'], ['TGFb'], ['aPKC'], ['Par6']]
58dfd83a6fddd3e83e000003	List genes associated with hypolipidemia.	 Conversely familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is caused by inactivation of the PCSK9 gene which increases the number of LDL receptors and decreases plasma cholesterol. Mutations in the genes APOB, and ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 (that encode angiopoietin-like proteins which inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity) can further cause low levels of apoB containing lipoproteins Several mutations in the apoB, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and MTP genes result in low or absent levels of apoB and LDL-cholesterol in plasma, which cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia. Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia.  Mutations of the ANGPTL3 gene have been associated with a novel form of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia, the combined hypolipidemia (cHLP), characterized by low total cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol levels.  These results demonstrated that in a cohort of subjects with severe primary hypobetalipoproteinemia the prevalence of ANGPTL3 gene mutations responsible for a combined hypolipidemia phenotype is about 10%, whereas mutations of APOB gene are absent. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum.

The clinical features of cytopenia, developmental defects, and tumor predisposition are similar in each group, suggesting that the gene products participate in a common pathway. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by diverse congenital malformations, progressive pancytopenia and predisposition to both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors Patients with FA exhibit a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical features. The most significant and consistent phenotypic characteristics are stem cell loss, causing progressive bone marrow failure and sterility, diverse developmental abnormalities and a profound predisposition to neoplasia Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, cancer susceptibility disorder characterized by diverse clinical features, such as short stature, skeletal or skin abnormalities, progressive bone marrow (BM) failure, and increased risk of malignancies Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by congenital abnormalities, defective haemopoiesis, and a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia and certain solid tumours Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. Fanconi anemia (FA) consists of a group of at least five autosomal recessive disorders that share both clinical (e.g., birth defects and hematopoietic failure) and cellular (e.g., sensitivity to cross-linking agents and predisposition to apoptosis) features with each other. Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia. Progressive bone marrow failure starting in the first decade of life is one of the main characteristics of Fanconi anemia FA is an autosomal recessive disease with three main features: chromosome instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin and so on, and susceptible to a number of cancer types, mainly leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck or gynecologic system Bone marrow failure resulting in pancytopenia is the main cause of death of FA patients	[['congenital abnormalities'], ['defective haemopoiesis'], ['increased risk of malignancies'], ['cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents']]
5311bf53e3eabad021000006	Which are the biotracers used for detection of Alzheimer's disease using PET?	(18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample. This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid β positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting)  is implicated in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects. High Aβ dep g biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid deposition [imaged with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose metabolism (imaged with [(18)F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural atrophy (imaged by MRI). Recently we published the initial subset of imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. We now exte Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent Aβ burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that Aβ-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE T ol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging. The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance. We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects. By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls). In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights. The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy. The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus. Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard. Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85.2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases. Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI. In the MCI  disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). These techniques, however, are not specific for AD. Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several Aβ-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD. Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied Aβ-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world. The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between Aβ-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging. Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed. At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials. This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of Aβ-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing Aβ content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology. In addition, is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE ε4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- EMCI and ε4- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than ε4- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE ε4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data als sitron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for β-amyloid (Aβ). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled Aβ ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvid™) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain.

54fc9b236ad7dcbc12000005	List adenosine A2A receptor antagonists that are used for Parkinson's disease treatment.	Adenosine A2A antagonists, such as istradefylline, improve motor function in PD, but their effect on cognitive impairment has not been determined. Both istradefylline and preladenant have demonstrated moderate efficacy in reducing off time in PD patients with motor fluctuations.   The available data also suggest that caffeine can improve the motor deficits of PD and that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists such as istradefylline reduces OFF time and dyskinesia associated with standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments.  Istradefylline (KW-6002) is the first of several adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in development for PD to advance to phase III clinical trials. Initial studies indicate that in patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa, addition of istradefylline reduces 'off' time.  These include alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, fipamezole), adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (eg, istradefylline), AMPA receptor antagonists (eg, talampanel), neuronal synchronization modulators (eg, levetiracetam) and agents that interact with serotonergic systems such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonists (eg, sarizotan) and 5-HT2A antagonists (eg, quetiapine).

54d8d60d014675820d000007	List BRAF inhibitors that have been tested in clinical trials for treatment of melanoma patients	Combined BRAF (Dabrafenib) and MEK inhibition (Trametinib) in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma experiencing progression with single-agent BRAF inhibitor.  Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45).  This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.  METHODS: All patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib or combination BRAF inhibitor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia underwent regular dermatological assessments for the duration of therapy. We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma.  We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor.  However, it is becoming evident that the effects of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by BRAF inhibitors in non-BRAF-mutant cells needs to be taken into account, which may be implicated in the problems encountered in the first clinical trial testing a combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), with significant liver toxicities. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab. Thirty-one patients commenced dabrafenib therapy including six individuals who had progressed on a prior BRAF-inhibitor treatment. Population pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor: effect of dose, time, covariates, and relationship with its metabolites. Dabrafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma.  This was a prospective study of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600 mutation and treated with iBRAF within a clinical trial (dabrafenib) or as part of an expanded access program (vemurafenib). We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma.  Tumor genetic analyses of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436). PURPOSE: Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF kinase, which recently showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with dacarbazine, in metastatic melanoma patients.  Phase II trial (BREAK-2) of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436) in patients with metastatic melanoma. PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a concerning toxicity with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment for melanoma. While the two drugs shown to improve survival, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, have similar efficacy, the reported rates of cSCC are quite different. PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy.  BACKGROUND: The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test is a CE-marked and FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic assay used to select patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib The purpose of this study is to review the development of BRAF inhibitors, with emphasis on the trials conducted with dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the evolving role of dabrafenib in treatment for melanoma patients. Dabrafenib inhibits the mutant BRAF (BRAF(mut)) protein in melanomas with BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) genotypes. To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Cutaneous manifestations of dabrafenib (GSK2118436): a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF in patients with metastatic melanoma. We conducted a systematic prospective dermatological review of all patients enrolled at a single institution in the phase I/II clinical trial of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy. Neoplastic leptomeningitis presenting in a melanoma patient treated with dabrafenib (a V600EBRAF inhibitor): a case report. For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy. BACKGROUND: The development of keratoacanthomas (KAs) and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is a known adverse effect of novel BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with stage IV melanoma who received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) as part of a clinical trial and developed numerous diffuse, pathology-proven KAs and SCCs.  CONCLUSIONS: Given vemurafenib's recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, we provide a timely case report on the effective use of PDT in the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-associated KAs and SCCs.  The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has shown up to 78% objective response rates in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation but not in patients lacking the mutation.  The oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial.  CONTEXT: A polymerase chain reaction-based companion diagnostic (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to select patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma for treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.  However, in the recent clinical trial of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response.  Vemurafenib (RG7204/PLX4032), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown striking clinical efficacy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, creating the need for a well-validated companion diagnostic to select patients for treatment. BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib is the first molecularly targeted therapy to be licensed in the US and Europe for treatment of advanced melanoma Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway	[['Vemurafenib'], ['Dabrafenib']]

6027fcd31cb411341a0000ef	Which methods exist for efficient calculation of Elementary flux modes (EFMs) in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs)?	Elementary flux modes (EFMs) analysis constitutes a fundamental tool in systems biology. However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge. We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs.RESULTS: Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time. We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-OR Linear program Solver (CLP). Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are a key tool for analyzing genome-scale metabolic networks, and several methods have been proposed to compute them. Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs.RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver. We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.

The experimental results show that our ensemble learning approach outperforms the four gene-prioritization methods in ToppGene suite in the ranking results of the 13 known genes in terms of mean average precision, ROC and AUC measures The proposed enhanced RaJoLink rare-term model combines text mining and gene prioritization approaches.  Computational gene prioritization is based on various pieces of correlative evidence that associate each gene with the given disease and suggest possible causal links Recently, many network-based methods have been proposed that implicitly utilize the modularity principle, which states that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to form physical or functional modules in gene/protein relationship networks the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach, but the modularity principle has not been fully considered in traditional RWR approaches Therefore, we propose a novel method called ORIENT (neighbor-favoring weight reinforcement) to improve the performance of RWR through proper intensification of the weights of interactions close to the known disease genes Network-based methods have been successfully exploiting this concept by capturing the interaction of genes or proteins into a score  Over the last years, computational approaches exploiting interaction network topology have been successfully applied to prioritize individual genes involved in diseases. Here, we propose a genome-wide network-based prioritization framework named GUILD The traditional approach to reduce the number of candidate genes entails fine-mapping studies using markers and pedigrees For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification.  hus, comparing the similarity between experimentally identified phenotypes and the phenotypes associated with human diseases can be used to suggest causal genes underlying a disease. In this manuscript, we present a method for disease gene prioritization based on comparing phenotypes of mouse models with those of human diseases. We present biomarker identification problem using gene prioritization method called gene prioritization from microarray data based on shortest paths, extended with structural and biological properties and edge flux using voting scheme (GP-MIDAS-VXEF). ensemble approach to microarray data-based gene prioritization after missing value imputation Recently, we have introduced the data mining tool ENDEAVOUR (Aerts et al., 2006), which performs this task automatically by relying on different genome-wide data sources, such as Gene Ontology, literature, microarray, sequence and more So far, biologists have relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine such an ordering We study the effect of different data integration methods, and based on the validation studies, we show that our approach, ToppGene http://toppgene.cchmc.org, outperforms two of the existing candidate gene prioritization methods, SUSPECTS and ENDEAVOU  Extending on an earlier hypothesis that the majority of genes that impact or cause disease share membership in any of several functional relationships we, for the first time, show the utility of mouse phenotype data in human disease gene prioritization We use co-expression data from yeast (S. cerevisiae), nematode worm (C. elegans), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), mouse and human and find that the use of evolutionary conservation can indeed improve the predictive value of co-expression Using a training set of genes known to be involved in a biological process of interest, our approach consists of (i) inferring several models (based on various genomic data sources), (ii) applying each model to the candidate genes to rank those candidates against the profile of the known genes and (iii) merging the several rankings into a global ranking of the candidate genes vocabularies, representations and ranking algorithms for gene prioritization by text mining Recently, text mining techniques have been applied to extract prior knowledge from text-based genomic information sources and this knowledge can be used to improve the prioritization process We present an approach to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms for further follow-up in genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes The proposed method combines both the use of open data access from two type 2 diabetes-genome-wide association studies (granted by the Diabetes Genetics Initiative and the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium) and the comprehensive analysis of candidate regions generated by the freely accessible ENDEAVOUR software. ToppGene Suite (http://toppgene.cchmc.org; this web site is free and open to all users and does not require a login to access) is a one-stop portal for (i) gene list functional enrichment, (ii) candidate gene prioritization using either functional annotations or network analysis and (iii) identification and prioritization of novel disease candidate genes in the interactome. The protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)-based disease candidate gene prioritization uses social and Web networks analysis algorithms (extended versions of the PageRank and HITS algorithms, and the K-Step Markov method) We present gene prioritization system (GPSy), a cross-species gene prioritization system that facilitates the arduous but critical task of prioritizing genes for follow-up functional analyses GPEC: a Cytoscape plug-in for random walk-based gene prioritization and biomedical evidence collection Among these, network-based approaches are recently proposed and outperformed functional annotation-based ones In the plug-in, gene prioritization is performed through a random walk with restart algorithm, a state-of-the art network-based method, along with a gene/protein relationship networ Here we present a multi-dimensional evidence-based candidate gene prioritization approach for complex diseases and demonstrate it in schizophrenia We present a multi-view approach to retrieve biomedical knowledge using different controlled vocabularies Given a query list, GeneMANIA extends the list with functionally similar genes that it identifies using available genomics and proteomics data Genomic linkage and association studies are commonly performed for identifying disease-related gene Here, we introduce MedSim, a novel approach for ranking candidate genes for a particular disease based on functional comparisons involving the Gene Ontology MedSim uses functional annotations of known disease genes for assessing the similarity of diseases as well as the disease relevance of candidate genes Here, we report a large-scale analysis of spatial, i.e. 3D, gene-expression data from an entire organ (the mouse brain) for the purpose of evaluating and ranking positional candidate genes, showing that the spatial gene-expression patterns can be successfully exploited for the prediction of gene-phenotype associations not only for mouse phenotypes, but also for human central nervous system-related Mendelian disorders In this paper, we propose an expandable framework for gene prioritization that can integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources by taking advantage of a unified graphic representation We demonstrate that existing methods are likely to favor highly connected genes, making prioritization sensitive to the skewed degree distribution of PPI networks, as well as ascertainment bias in available interaction and disease association data Motivated by this observation, we propose several statistical adjustment methods to account for the degree distribution of known disease and candidate genes, using a PPI network with associated confidence scores for interactions Here we employ a previously described method of candidate gene prioritization based mainly on gene annotation, in accompaniment with a technique based on the evaluation of pertinent sequence motifs or signatures, in an attempt to refine the gene prioritization approach. We introduce the novel Génie algorithm that overcomes these problems by evaluating the literature attached to all genes in a genome and to their orthologs according to a selected topic PINTA (available at http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/pinta/; this web site is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement) is a web resource for the prioritization of candidate genes based on the differential expression of their neighborhood in a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network We have recently developed a computational method for constitutional genetic disorders that identifies the most promising candidate genes by replacing prior knowledge by experimental data of differential gene expression between affected and healthy individual	[['network-based methods']]

601bef4b1cb411341a000007	Missense mutations in which genes cause X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy?	GRIA3 missense mutation is cause of an x-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. We report a patient carrying a hemizygous missense variant c.2359 G > A (p.Glu787Lys) inGRIA3 gene. Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations.RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus. In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined. Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks. Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases. Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events. The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor. Severity of ID ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders. Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia.CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants. Larger investigations will better define the prevalence of epilepsy, the epileptic phenotype, and syndromic features underlying GRIA3 variants. Missense variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are intracellular proteins which regulate voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the brain and other tissues. FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function.

60274ec61cb411341a0000e5	Which drugs are included in the VAC regiment for Ewing's sarcoma?	All underwent surgical exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) alternating with ICE (ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide) for at least six cycles. For patients with localized, gross residual tumor, adding doxorubicin (DOX) to the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC), and XRT did not significantly improve survival in 39 patients (62% alive at 10 years) compared with that of 24 patients treated with VAC and XRT without DOX (65% alive at 10 years, P = .93). Patients with tumors in clinical groups II, III, and IV were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) and vincristine-dactinomycin (VA) or VA plus cyclophosphamide (VAC) +/- doxorubicin.  Despite numerous molecular and biological studies during the past three decades, the chemotherapeutic regimen remains unchanged. This vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) regime, described in Kilman, et al. (1973) and Koop, et al. (1963), has achieved limited success in controlling the progression of RMS.  After the induction chemotherapy consisting of alternating vincristine, adriablastin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) and etoposide, ifosfamide with mesna protection (IE), a local treatment modality was chosen based on tumor and patient characteristics. Induction chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of 'VAC': vincristine (V), doxorubicin (A), cyclophosphamide (C) alternated with one cycle of 'VIAc': V, ifosfamide (I), actinomycin (Ac).  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In Novembe BACKGROUND: Based on the randomised Euro-EWING99-R1 trial, vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) may be able to replace vincristine, adriamycin, ifosfamide (VAI) in the treatment of standard-risk Ewing sarcoma Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14 patients with Ewing's sarcoma. The pr Every patient received both types of G-CSF in different treatment courses of chemotherapy, which consisted of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE); vincristine, actinomycin D, and ifosfamide (VAI); or vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC).  VAC (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide) regimens with anthracyclines resulted in better survival. Presence of distant metastases, large primary tumors, and pelvic localization were related to poor prognosis. The effective treatment for sarcoma botryoides is wide excision with safe margin of 1-2 cm, followed by 6-12 cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) regiment as an adjuvant chemotherapy.  Cyclophosphamide dose escalation in combination with vincristine and actinomycin-D (VAC) in gross residual sarcoma. A pilot study without hematopoietic growth factor support evaluating toxicity and response. PURPOSE: The Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) initiated an escalating-dose cyclophosphamide (Cyc) pilot without hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) support in combination with vincristine (Vcr) and actinomycin-D (Amd), known as VAC, to establish a Cyc dose with myelotoxicity comparable to an ifosfamide (Ifos), Vcr, and Amd combination regimen (VAI). PROCEDURE: Standard chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/ifosfamide (VP16/IFOS) cycles, alternating with vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide (VAC) cycles.  The Intergroup Study was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and metastases. Taking the lead from the use of vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) by Dr. Ruth Heyn, Dr. Harold Mauer and colleagues developed a more robust VAC as well as three similar drug regimens with hematopoietic growth factor support, which, in the context of surgery with or without radiotherapy, achieved a 3-year failure-free survival rate of 83% (IRS-IV) in nonmetastatic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

601c2fb51cb411341a000013	Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?	Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. They include agents that act against TNFα (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL-1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), IL-17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab) and IL12/23 (ustekinumab). The efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β cytokine trap, were studied previously in a phase 2 trial involving patients with recurrent pericarditis. Rilonacept inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought to play a major role in RP.  Rilonacept is a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes primarily IL-1β but also IL-1α.	[['interleukin-1α'], ['interleukin-1β']]
530cefaaad0bf1360c000002	Which brain structures have been investigated as potential targets for deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression?	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under scientific evaluation as a new treatment option for these treatment-resistant patients. First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc).  New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials.  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) has antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The ventral striatum, including the head of the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens, is a putative target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depression (MD).  High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas. We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory major depression.  Functional inhibition of the lateral habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties. Because a prominent clinical feature of depression is anhedonia--the inability to experience pleasure from previously pleasurable activities--and because there is clear evidence of dysfunctions of the reward system in depression, DBS to the nucleus accumbens might offer a new possibility to target depressive symptomatology in otherwise treatment-resistant depression. These preliminary findings suggest that DBS to the nucleus accumbens might be a hypothesis-guided approach for refractory major depression. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral caudate nucleus markedly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety until their remission, which was achieved at 6 months after the start of stimulation (HDRS < or = 7 and HARS < or = 10). No neuropsychological deterioration was observed, indicating that DBS of the ventral caudate nucleus could be a promising strategy in the treatment of refractory cases of both OCD and major depression. Comparisons of clinical outcomes and anatomical data on electrode positioning showed that caudate nucleus stimulation preferentially alleviated OCD manifestations, whereas nucleus accumbens stimulation improved depressive symptoms.

516c0ebc298dcd4e5100006e	Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?	our data suggests that TRbeta1-mediated down regulation of hepatic LDLr gene may play a critical role in iodine excess-induced hypercholesterolemic effects. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. However, the T3-activated expression of the GH gene in GH3-PV and ME gene in SK-Hep-1-PV was repressed by approximately 30% and 90%, respectively, indicating the lack of correlation of PV/TRpbeta1 protein ratio with the dominant negative potency of mutant PV. Transient cotransfection of P450R promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs and the thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TR beta1) expression plasmid into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells resulted in a 2.4-fold induction of promoter activity that was both T3 and TR beta1 dependent. At the molecular level, we detected a dose-dependent attenuation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1) expression in parallel to the change of serum cholesterol.

534ab91eaeec6fbd07000012	Which genes were found to be methylated in bladder cancer cells?	CpG island in promoter of hepaCAM gene was hyper-methylated both in bladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines (T24 and BIU-87). Otherwise, aberrant methylation of its promoter was associated with its decreased expression. Abnormal hypermethylation in CpG island of hepaCAM promoter is involved in absence of hepaCAM gene expression when bladder cancer occurs. Methylated RARβ(2) and APC were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients (62.8%, 59.5%) than benign (16.4%, 5%) but not detected in healthy volunteers (0%) at (P < 0.0001). Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73.4%) showed methylated RARβ(2) and 86 (67.2%) showed methylated APC. Thus, methylated RARβ(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer. Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells. hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues. Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells. Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of hepaCAM gene was reversed and expression of its mRNA and protein were re-activated in two cell lines by DNA methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-CdR	[['hepaCAM (hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule)'], ['RARβ(2)'], ['APC'], ['TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain)'], ['RASSF1A'], ['p14(ARF)'], ['p16']]

Fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC-75) followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab followed by FEC-75 plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (Z1041): a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment received fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC-75) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) once per week for 12 weeks, while those randomly assigned to the concurrent treatment group received paclitaxel and trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of FEC-75 (on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and once-weekly trastuzumab, in the same doses as the sequential group. In May 2008, the patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy consisting of 4 courses of FEC 75(fluororracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Stage II-IIIC HER2-positive breast cancer patients, including inflammatory disease, were treated with weekly-trastuzumab for 24 weeks administered concurrently with all primary chemotherapy containing paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks and 4 cycles of FEC-75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicine 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) followed by surgery.  Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.  BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe cardiac toxicity.  Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles).  The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles. Sixty chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients of 30 to 71 years in age, P.S. = 0-1, receiving 5-fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC 75) q 21 days or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 120 mg/m2 epirubicin or high dose mitomycin-methotrexate-mitoxantrone (MMM) q 14 days (+ G-CSF) or 100 mg/m2 epirubicin (+ G-CSF) were randomized to receive, 15 min before chemotherapy, 8 mg i.v. bolus of ondansetron or 3 mg i.v. granisetron or 5 mg i.v. tropisetron and no further antiemetic therapy in the following days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization. The aim of this study, using a Fleming single-stage design, was to explore the efficacy and safety of Taxotere 100 x mg x m(-2) docetaxel and FEC 75 cyclophosphamide 500 mg x m(-2), fluorouracil 500 x mg x m(-2) and epirubicin 75 mg x m(-2), in alternating and sequential schedules for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). We studied the feasibility of FEC (75) (fluorouracil: 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin: 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide:500 mg/m(2), q 3 w, 6 cycles) as adjuvant chemotherapy for 59 primary breast cancer patients.

56d042ae3975bb303a00000d	When ceritinib used instead of crizotinib?	Ceritinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in crizotinib-resistant patients, becoming a promising treatment option in this population.  Ceritinib is approved for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in patients who are intolerant to or have progressed despite therapy with crizotinib.  Ceritinib has activity in crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-naïve patients and appears to be a viable alternative for ALK-positive NSCLC. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer are also presented. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. Preclinical data showed impressive antitumor activity against crizotinib-resistant clones, and based on available data, ceritinib could represent a suitable option in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC. The ALK inhibitor ceritinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. Ceritinib (LDK378): a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.SIGNIFICANCE: The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.

5c7006037c78d6947100005d	Which characteristics are used in the SLEDAI index for SLE patients?	Twenty-four variables were identified as important factors in a disease activity index. This generated a "weighted" index of 9 organ systems for disease activity in SLE, the SLEDAI 8 for central nervous system and vascular, 4 for renal and musculoskeletal, 2 for serosal, dermal, immunologic, and 1 for constitutional and hematologic. Patients with SLEDAI-2K renal, immunological and hematologic active descriptors were identified. For the prediction of survival, AMS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, p < 0.0001] and age at diagnosis (HR 1.05, p < 0.0001) were the only significant risk factors. For presence of damage, AMS (HR 1.06, p < 0.0001), age at diagnosis (HR 1.02, p = 0.0004), and disease duration (HR 1.05, p < 0.0001) were predictors.

51475d5cd24251bc0500001b	Where is X-ray free electron laser used?	In conjunction with the XFEL temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage. We discuss the pertinent physics of the intense X-ray-matter interactions, and illustrate the importance of electron-ion collisions. Detailed simulations of the interaction process conducted with a radiative-collisional code show good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We obtain insights into the evolution of the charge state distribution of the system, the electron density and temperature, and the timescales of collisional processes. Our results should inform future high-intensity X-ray experiments involving dense samples, such as X-ray diffractive imaging of biological systems, material science investigations, and the study of matter in extreme conditions. employment of "exotic" systems, such as the Free Electron LASER (FEL), that are expected to focus on the fundamental processes of life, following chemical reactions and biological processes as they happen, on unprecedented time and size scales. New data analysis approaches are outlined for the correlated fluctuations in fast WAXS, for protein nanocrystals just a few molecules on a side, and for the continuous x-ray scattering from a single virus Research opportunities and techniques are reviewed for the application of hard x-ray pulsed free-electron lasers (XFEL) to structural biology. These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump--probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. The use of femtosecond exposure times, rather than freezing of samples, as a means of minimizing radiation damage is shown to open up new opportunities for the molecular imaging of biochemical reactions at room temperature in solution New opportunities for solving the phase problem for XFEL data are outlined. A summary of the latest results is given, which now extend to atomic resolution for nanocrystals. Possibilities for time-resolved chemistry using fast WAXS (solution scattering) from mixtures is reviewed, toward the general goal of making molecular movies of biochemical processes. Molecular imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers. The recent development of X-ray free-electron laser sources has created new opportunities for the structural analysis of protein nanocrystals. X-ray free electron lasers hold the promise of enabling atomic-resolution diffractive imaging of single biological molecules. The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales. In this paper we report room temperature X-ray diffraction data of PS II microcrystals obtained using ultrashort (< 50 fs) 9 keV X-ray pulses from a hard X-ray free electron laser, namely the Linac Coherent Light Source. High-resolution protein structure determination by serial femtosecond crystallography We applied serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals (less than 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer by 3 micrometers) of the well-characterized model protein lysozyme. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. Here we recorded interpretable diffraction data from micrometer-sized lipidic sponge phase crystals of the Blastochloris viridis photosynthetic reaction center delivered into an X-FEL beam Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-crystalline biological sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. Single mimivirus particles intercepted and imaged with an X-ray laser Femtosecond X-ray protein nanocrystallography Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray free-electron laser sources. With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules. X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. Diffractive imaging using the intense and coherent beam of X-ray free-electron lasers opens new perspectives for structural studies of single nanoparticles and biomolecules. The opening of hard X-ray free-electron laser facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the United States, has ushered in a new era in structural determination. Where possible we also highlight areas that we think could push this field forward with emerging technologies, such as X-ray free electron lasers (X-feL), which could have a big impact on the membrane protein structural biology community. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) deliver short (<100 fs) and intense (∼10(12) photons) pulses of hard X-rays, making them excellent sources for time-resolved studies. Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. In single-particle coherent x-ray diffraction imaging experiments, performed at x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), samples are exposed to intense x-ray pulses to obtain single-shot diffraction patterns. The structure reveals the mechanism of native TbCatB inhibition and demonstrates that new biomolecular information can be obtained by the "diffraction-before-destruction" approach of x-ray free-electron lasers from hundreds of thousands of individual microcrystals. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Ultrashort X-ray pulses from free-electron laser X-ray sources make it feasible to conduct small- and wide-angle scattering experiments on biomolecular samples in solution at sub-picosecond timescales. The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage destroys the sample. The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL)-based serial femtosecond crystallography is an emerging method with potential to rapidly advance the challenging field of membrane protein structural biology. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains largely unsolved. Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from x-ray free-electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data, or both. By combining serial nanocrystallography with x-ray free-electron laser sources in the future, it may be possible to produce molecular-resolution electron-density maps using membrane protein crystals that contain only a few hundred or thousand unit cells. Very strong soft X-ray free electron laser (FEL) pulses must be short to allow for investigations of ultra-fast wet chemistry, according to the principle of collect and destroy.

517539e68ed59a060a000028	Which mitochondrial genes are regulated by thyroid hormone?	We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mRNA differential display (DD) analysis to obtain a profile of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in osteoblast-like cells At the 2-hour time point, 1 true-positive novel clone was identified and shown to be the mitochondrial gene, subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATPase-6). We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment. Following this procedure, we now report the identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as target of thyroid hormone. Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene.

54f0920f94afd61504000018	List drugs included in the DHAP-R chemotherapy regiment.	Standard treatment of transplant-eligible patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of rituximab and platinum-based chemotherapy, either ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) or dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP), with autologous transplant consolidation for those with chemosensitive disease. The intergroup Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) set the limits for this standard of treatment after first comparing 2 salvage regimens: rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) and rituximab, dexamethasone, aracytine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).  The response rate (RR) to first salvage chemotherapy was 23% (RR by regimen: dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [DHAP] 15%, etoposide, Solu-Medrol, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [ESHAP] 36%, and gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin [GDP] 45%); 25% (n = 28) of patients underwent ASCT.  PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens based on platinum and cytarabine in association with etoposide and methylprednisolone (ESHAP) or with dexamethasone (DHAP) with or without Rituximab (± R) in patients with refractory or a relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).  R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP). Because of the inability to safely administer unattenuated doses of anthracycline-based regimens, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) was used at full doses (along with rituximab for the DLBCL patient) until hepatic function normalized (1-5 cycles).  Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable).  Patients are first randomised between ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, ara-C and cisplatin), both combined with rituximab (R-ICE or R-DHAP). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The treatment of the patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) remains difficult.

5e36e254b5b409ea53000010	List SLC25A46-related pathologies	The mitochondrial protein SLC25A46 has been recently identified as a novel pathogenic cause in a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, including inherited optic atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, Leigh syndrome, progressive myoclonic ataxia and lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Here we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the Slc25a46 gene that causes lethal neuropathology in mice. Mutant mice manifest the main clinical features identified in patients, including ataxia, optic atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia, which were completely rescued by expression of the human ortholog. Histopathological analysis revealed previously unseen lesions, most notably disrupted cytoarchitecture in the cerebellum and retina and prominent abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction. A distinct lymphoid phenotype was also evident. Our mutant mice provide a valid model for understanding the mechanistic basis of the complex SLC25A46-mediated pathologies, as well as for screening potential therapeutic interventions.

5322d3cb9b2d7acc7e000010	Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?	Inhibition of HDAC6 deacetylase activity increases its binding with microtubules and suppresses microtubule dynamic instability in MCF-7 cells HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions. Moreover, acetylation of α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). MEC-17 deficiency leads to reduced α-tubulin acetylation and impaired migration of cortical neurons MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different species in vivo. Thus, MEC-17, which regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, appears to control the migration and morphological transition of cortical neurons. This finding reveals the importance of MEC-17 and α-tubulin acetylation in cortical development. NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an α-tubulin deacetylase. Moreover, α-tubulin acetylation levels of microtubules specifically extending into the terminal synaptic boutons are reduced in response to dTip60 HAT reduction. In this study, angiotensin II induced disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using RNA interference. These data show that angiotensin II and mechanical stretch stimulate microtubule redistribution and deacetylation via SIRT2 in endothelial cells, suggesting the emerging role of SIRT2 in hypertension-induced vascular remodeling. Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic microtubule dynamics can be explained by impaired histone deacetylase 6 function Addition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold). Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules. We propose that lower HDAC6 levels combined with decreased microtubule binding lead to increased tubulin acetylation in ethanol-treated cells. The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their activity towards the HDAC6 isoform. Nicotinamide but not 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin deacetylase, could modulate resistance to axonal degeneration. Moreover, SIRT2 overexpression abrogated microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in these cells. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown by using a lentiviral vector expressing small interfering RNA, enhanced microtubule acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in WT granule cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SIRT2-mediated tubulin deacetylation is involved in both microtubule hyperacetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in Wld(S) granule cells. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin	[['MEC-17'], ['SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2)'], ['HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6)'], ['dTip60']]

515df86a298dcd4e5100002e	List co-morbidities that may occur together with "Stiff man Syndrome"	To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves' disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature. This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves' disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with immunosuppressive therapy. HCV may be the etiologic virus of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity; a rare disorder similar to stiff-man syndrome although different because it is progressive and fatal. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS. GAD has been suggested as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). GAD-65 is a dominant autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An elderly man with progressive dementia and concomitant development of stiff-man syndrome is described. He had not had stiff-man syndrome one year earlier, when he had only mild dementia. An association between stiff-man syndrome and dementia has not been previously described. It is possible that this patient represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia.

54d77bdf3706e89528000019	List chromosomes that have been linked to Arnold Chiari syndrome in the literature.	Consistent with a genetic hypothesis for CMI, much of the PF morphology was found to be heritable and multiple genomic regions were strongly implicated from OSA, including regions on Chromosomes 1 (LOD = 3.07, p = 3 × 10(-3) ) and 22 (LOD = 3.45, p = 6 × 10(-5) ) containing several candidates warranting further investigation. Furthermore, we report the first case of documented Arnold-Chiari malformation type I and increased factor XIII activity associated with 6p trisomy.  Of particular interest were two regions (Chr8, Max LOD = 3.04; Chr12, Max LOD = 2.09) identified within the subset of "CTD-negative" families, both of which harbor growth differentiation factors (GDF6, GDF3) implicated in the development of Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS). Moreover, the performed DNA analysis showed interstitial duplication in chromosome 5 (5q35.1).

A 13-year-old with pentasomy 49,XXXXY and a Chiari type 1 malformation with an associated cervical syrinx is presented. Phenotypic definition of Chiari type I malformation coupled with high-density SNP genome screen shows significant evidence for linkage to regions on chromosomes 9 and 15. Two-point LOD scores on chromosome 15 reached 3.3 and multipoint scores in this region identified a 13 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (15q21.1-22.3).  Multipoint LOD scores on chromosome 9 maximized at 3.05, identifying a 40 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (9q21.33-33.1) and a tighter region with multipoint LOD scores over 2 that was only 8.5 cM.  In addition, this child had an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation that required surgical decompression. FISH studies using BAC clones spanning the 5q15 to 5q22 region revealed that these were all present in both homologues.  The karyotype showed 46, XY, del(1)(q23q31.2).

5c7a4a31d774d04240000006	Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?	PD-L1 expression has shown a positive association with response to PD-1 inhibition in noncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g., melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, and is discussed as a potential predictive biomarker for patient selection in these tumor types.  In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development. Emerging data suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1 by IHC have improved clinical outcomes with anti-PD-1-directed therapy, but the presence of robust responses in some patients with low levels of expression of these markers complicates the issue of PD-L1 as an exclusionary predictive biomarker.  The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cells it is not clear whether expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response.  In conclusion, while PD-L1 expression is often a predictive factor for treatment response, it must be complemented by other biomarkers or histopathologic features, such as the composition and amount of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment and their functional status. PD-L1 expression is likely an imperfect predictive biomarker for patient selection and association with other markers of the tumor immune microenvironment will be probably necessary in the future. Taking this data in account, PD-L1 overexpression could not be currently considered a robust biomarker to tailor the immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment. Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. I However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to be confirmed by larger studies. . Although the most studied biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. PD-L1: a novel prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, while the significance of PD-L2 in HNSCC seems to minor, we show that PD-L1 expression is common in HNSCC and, more importantly, a both robust and strong prognostic biomarker.  Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Thus, sPD-L1 levels are increased in melanoma patients with severe OSA and, in addition, might serve as a potential biomarker of CM aggressiveness and invasiveness in this group of subjects. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a validated biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is often also used to select patients for CIT in the context of gastroesophageal cancer, although this marker has not been validated for this purpose. We question the use of PD-L1 as a biomarker in gastroesophageal cancers, as there are fundamental differences in PD-L1 expression between NSCLC and gastroesophageal cancers. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Breaking the biomarker code: PD-L1 expression and checkpoint inhibition in advanced NSCLC. PD-L1 Expression in Carcinosarcomas of the Gynecologic Tract: A Potentially Actionable Biomarker. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker. Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges.

5543a1b2ee40ea110c000001	In what type(s) of plant organelles we can detect prolamellar bodies?	CPP1 depletion also causes reduced POR accumulation in etioplasts of dark-grown plants and as a result impairs the formation of prolamellar bodies, which subsequently affects chloroplast biogenesis upon illumination. Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) isolated from etiolated wheat seedlings were studied with the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy TEM analyses confirmed that PLBs of wheat leaf etioplasts also had an average diameter of appr. 1μm etioplasts with prolamellar bodies (PLBs) and photoactive, 655nm emitting Pchlide form accumulated primarily in the basal leaf regions after 2 weeks of regeneration. When these latter leaves were illuminated with continuous light for 3 days, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts POR complex assembly (including LHPP and POR dimers) did not affect the formation of prolamellar bodies (PLBs) that function for efficient capture of light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts. Etioplasts that develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark contain a highly organized lipid structure termed prolamellar body (PLB), which is the main site of accumulation of the ternary Pchlide:POR:NADPH complexes. During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms an aggregate of photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes localized to the prolamellar bodies within etioplasts. The content of the supramolecular light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase:protochlorophyllide) and the density of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts are decreased in the mutant. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts The most notable contributions of thin section electron microscopy include the elucidation of the 3-D organization of thylakoid membranes, the discovery of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts This resulted in the recovery of thylakoid membrane stacking in chloroplasts in the light, and the formation of prolamellar bodies and plastoglobuli in etioplasts in the dark. The prolamellar body (PLB) proteome of dark-grown wheat leaves was characterized. PLBs are formed not only in etioplasts but also in chloroplasts in young developing leaves during the night A fraction of highly purified prolamellar bodies was isolated from etioplasts of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. The highest specific activity of the enzyme in etiolated leaf tissue was confirmed to be in the fraction of prolamellar bodies. This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts and decreased thylakoid stacking in chloroplasts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed partially developed, agranal plastids in the dark-grown mutant, unlike wild-type seedlings that contain etioplasts with prolamellar bodies. Organization of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase in prolamellar bodies isolated from etiolated carotenoid-deficient wheat leaves as revealed by fluorescence probes. In fully etiolated leaves lamellae are absent and the prolamellar bodies become quite large, presumably because of inhibition of the fusion step which appears to require chlorophyll. POR is a peripheral membrane protein that accumulates to high levels in the prolamellar bodies of vascular plant etioplasts and is present at low levels in the thylakoid membranes of developing and mature plastids. This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition. The results presented in this paper are not consistent with the hypothesis that the molar ratio of MGDG/DGDG is responsible for the tubular structure of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts.

5a86c938faa1ab7d2e000034	Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?	The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2]. There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression Plant Stress Tolerance Requires Auxin-Sensitive Aux/IAA Transcriptional Repressors Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes in response to abiotic stress.  Here, we systematically dissect auxin sensing by SCFTIR1-IAA6 and SCFTIR1-IAA19 co-receptor complexes, and assess IAA6/IAA19 ubiquitylation in vitro and IAA6/IAA19 degradation in vivo. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Auxin-induced, SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination marks AUX/IAA proteins for degradation. evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1). Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking The tomato Aux/IAA transcription factor IAA9 is involved in fruit development and leaf morphogenesis We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3 The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays. AUX/IAA proteins are active repressors, and their stability and activity are modulated by auxin. The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2]. There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression [3]. Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Aux/IAA family, shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin-dependent transcription. The Aux/IAA genes are best characterized among the early auxin-responsive genes, which encode short-lived transcriptional repressors. plant stress tolerance requires auxin sensitive aux iaa transcriptional repressors genome wide analysis and characterization of aux iaa family genes in brassica rapa the aux iaa proteins are auxin sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants 1 2 there are 29 aux iaa genes in arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression 3 although some studies have suggested that individual aux iaa genes have specialized function genetic analyses of the family have been limited by the scarcity of loss of function phenotypes 4 furthermore with a few exceptions our knowledge of the factors that regulate aux iaa expression is limited 1 5 we hypothesize that transcriptional control of aux iaa genes plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin signaling pathways that regulate organogenesis growth and environmental response here we describe a screen for transcription factors tfs that regulate the aux iaa genes we identify tfs from 38 families including 26 members of the dreb cbf family several dreb cbf tfs directly promote transcription of the iaa5 and iaa19 genes in response to abiotic stress recessive mutations in these iaa genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network grn through transcription of the aux iaa genes we propose that the aux iaa genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or physiological outcome. auxin is a central hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth including the development of roots shoots flowers and fruit the perception and signaling of the plant hormone auxin rely on the cooperative action of several components among which auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa proteins play a pivotal role in this study we identified and comprehensively analyzed the entire aux iaa gene family in tomato solanum lycopersicum a reference species for solanaceae plants and the model plant for fleshy fruit development functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato aux iaa proteins function as active repressors of auxin dependent gene transcription with however different aux iaa members displaying varying levels of repression phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aux iaa gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with arabidopsis with a lower representation of non canonical proteins sl iaa genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene suggesting that aux iaas may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways the data presented here shed more light on sl iaa genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross talk. the aux iaa genes encode a large family of short lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants functional characterization of sliaa15 a member of the tomato solanum lycopersicum aux iaa family shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin dependent transcription the physiological significance of sliaa15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach revealing that sliaa15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes the sliaa15 down regulated lines display lower trichome number reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set moreover the leaves of sliaa15 inhibited plants are dark green and thick with larger pavement cells longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells the sliaa15 suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type i v and vi trichome formation suggesting that auxin dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation concomitant with reduced trichome formation the expression of some r2r3 myb genes putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation is altered these phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for aux iaas in plant developmental processes clearly indicating that members of the aux iaa gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific functions. auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation phototropism root fruit and embryo development auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling however many studies focus on aux arf gene families and much less is known about the aux iaa gene family in brassica rapa b rapa here we performed a comprehensive genome wide analysis and identified 55 aux iaa genes in b rapa using four conserved motifs of aux iaa family pf02309 chromosomal mapping of the b rapa aux iaa briaa genes facilitated understanding cluster rearrangement of the crucifer building blocks in the genome phylogenetic analysis of briaa with arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa and zea mays identified 51 sister pairs including 15 same species briaa briaa and 36 cross species briaa atiaa iaa genes among the 55 briaa genes expression of 43 and 45 genes were verified using genebank b rapa ests and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of chiifu and rcbr lines despite their huge morphological difference tissue specific expression analysis of briaa genes between the parental lines chiifu and rcbr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud flower and siliqua development stages the response of the briaa genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response single nucleotide polymorphisms between iaa genes of reference genome chiifu and rcbr were focused and identified our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of aux iaa genes and their structures in b rapa analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b rapa. the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development this largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression the aux iaa genes are best characterized among the early auxin responsive genes which encode short lived transcriptional repressors in most plants examined including arabidopsis soybean and rice the aux iaa genes constitute a large gene family by screening the available databases at least 15 expressed sequence tags ests have been identified from wheat triticum aestivum which exhibit high sequence identity with aux iaa homologues in other species one of these aux iaa genes taiaa1 harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the aux iaa proteins has been characterized in detail the expression of taiaa1 is light sensitive tissue specific and is induced within 15 30 min of exogenous auxin application also the taiaa1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation ca 2 and this effect is reversed by the calcium chelating agent egta the taiaa1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide in addition to auxin the taiaa1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development. auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development the auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa genes encode short lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the transport inhibitor response1 auxin receptor f box proteins the aux iaa proteins regulate auxin mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the auxin response factor protein family aux iaa function is poorly understood herein we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 aux iaa family members the mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type double or triple mutants of closely related aux iaa genes such as iaa8 1 iaa9 1 or iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 also exhibit wild type phenotypes global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin treated and untreated light grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17 6 and iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 mutants by contrast similar analysis with the gain of function axr3 1 iaa17 1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin induced gene expression compared with the wild type expression of several type a arabidopsis response regulator genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3 1 iaa17 1 the data suggest extensive functional redundancy among aux iaa gene family members and that enhanced stability of the axr3 iaa17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype resulting in developmental defects. the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil. auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes. recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.

602823e61cb411341a0000f9	Which drugs are included in the IROX regimen for colorectal cancer?	BACKGROUND: The authors hypothesized that patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who had tumors with low thymidylate synthase (TS-L) expression would have a higher response rate to combined 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) plus bevacizumab (FOLFOX/Bev) than those with high TS (TS-H) expression and that combined irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX) plus bevacizumab (IROX/Bev) would be more effective than FOLFOX/Bev in those with TS-H tumors. The 10 regimens included folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan (FOLFIRI), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + gemcitabine (FFG), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + trimetrexate (FFT), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil (FF), irinotecan + oxaliplatin (IROX), raltitrexed + oxaliplatin (TOMOX), folinic acid + tegafur-uracil (FTU), raltitrexed, and capecitabine.  We simulated phase II trials by resampling patients from N9741, a randomized phase III trial of chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer, and compared the power of various end points to detect the superior therapy (FOLFOX [infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin] had longer overall survival than both IROX [irinotecan plus oxaliplatin] and IFL [irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin]). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Germline DNA was extracted from 520 patients on the North American Gastrointestinal Intergroup N9741 study. Three study arms were evaluated: IFL (fluorouracil [FU] + irinotecan [IRN]), FOLFOX (FU + oxaliplatin), and IROX (IRN + oxaliplatin). The patient had progression of disease on IROX (irinotecan/oxaliplatin) and irinotecan/cetuximab regimens. He was started on gemcitabine/capecitabine and developed HFS again, which was controlled with aggressive skin care and vitamin B6 treatment. Haller et al. demonstrated that irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (IROX) is more efficacious than irinotecan alone after fluoropyrimidine failure in advanced colorectal cancer. UNLABELLED: PURPOSE To determine whether irinotecan plus oxaliplatin (IROX) is superior to irinotecan alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) previously treated with single-agent fluoropyrimidines.  The 10 regimens included folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan (FOLFIRI), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + gemcitabine (FFG), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil + trimetrexate (FFT), folinic acid + 5-fluorouracil (FF), irinotecan + oxaliplatin (IROX), raltitrexed + oxaliplatin (TOMOX), folinic acid + tegafur-uracil (FTU), raltitrexed, and capecitabine. Updated efficacy and toxicity analysis of irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX) : intergroup trial N9741 in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. We attempted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX) as a salvage treatment for patients with gemcitabine- and 5-FU- refractory pancreatic cancer. isease on IROX (irinotecan/oxaliplatin) and irinotecan/cetuximab regimens. He was started on gemcitabine/ca RESULTS: The observed 5-year survival with infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) of 9.8% was better than with irinotecan plus bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL; 3.7%; P = .04) or with bolus irinotecan/oxaliplatin (IROX; 5.1%; P = .128). We evaluated the irinotecan-oxaliplatin combination (IROX regimen) in previously untreated patients with non-favorable subsets of unknown primary carcinomas.

Repeat expansions are responsible for over 40 monogenic disorders, and undoubtedly more pathogenic repeat expansions remain to be discovered. Existing methods for detecting repeat expansions in short-read sequencing data require predefined repeat catalogs. Recent discoveries emphasize the need for methods that do not require pre-specified candidate repeats. To address this need, we introduce ExpansionHunter Denovo, an efficient catalog-free method for genome-wide repeat expansion detection. Analysis of real and simulated data shows that our method can identify large expansions of 41 out of 44 pathogenic repeats, including nine recently reported non-reference repeat expansions not discoverable via existing methods.

5a67afb7b750ff445500000d	List main clinical features of the POEMS syndrome.	POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to a plasma cell dyscrasia. Recognition of a combination of peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorder, skin changes, papilledema, extravascular volume overload, sclerotic bone lesions, thrombocytosis, and Castleman disease is the first step in managing the disease. Treatment of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome should be directed at the underlying plasma cell clone with risk-adapted therapy based on the extent of the plasma cell disorder. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder. POEMS is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome, namely, Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, and Skin abnormalities. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) is a multisystem disorder with a good long-term prognosis. The association of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes forms a characteristic multisystem syndrome, Crow-Fukase syndrome, or acronym POEMS syndrome. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem disorder arising from underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is an uncommon condition related to a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to an underlying plasma cell disorder. Pulmonary hypertension is one of the well-known clinical manifestations of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, occurring in approximately 25-30% of the affected individuals. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare disorder. Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, a plasma cell dyscrasia associated with pulmonary hypertension, has been treated in the past with anticytokine strategies with a poor outcome. A 48-year-old man with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome had bilateral optic disc edema (ODE), bilateral cystoid macular edema (CME), anasarca, and elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A 39-year-old woman presented with polyneuropathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and skin changes, several of the many clinical features of the recently described POEMS syndrome. The acronym POEMS is derived from main features of the syndrome namely 'polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions'. POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome, represents a rare multisystem syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes. Polyneuropathy is often an initial manifestation of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome and therefore this disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition, commonly associated with Castleman disease, that manifests with progressive distal polyneuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, often accompanied by endocrinopathy, organomegaly, skin changes, sclerotic bone lesions, ascites, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. We report a case of a 64-year-old man with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) syndrome that had been previously misdiagnosed as systemic sclerosis. POEMS syndrome is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes.

woman presented with polyneuropathy hepatomegaly splenomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal protein and skin changes several of the many clinical features of the recently described poems syndrome in addition she had a castleman s disease angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of ascites electron microscopy of the liver showed perisinusoidal fibrosis. the poems syndrome is a rare multisystemic disorder with polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy of various forms production of monoclonal m component and skin changes we describe a 46 year old man who developed ascites one year after the onset of peripheral neuropathy with accompanying muscle atrophies and increasing weakness extensive evaluation revealed that the patient had no underlying liver disease malignancy infection or cardiac or renal disease the ascites initially responded to high dose corticosteroid therapy the patient had many clinical features of the described poems syndrome including sclerotic bone lesions a persistent lambda paraprotein and refractory ascites in this case ascites was a main presenting feature thus the poems syndrome must be added to the list of rare causes of refractory ascites. poems syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation associated with hematopoietic disorders such as multiple myeloma and castleman disease poems is an acronym for the main clinical features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin abnormalities glomeruloid hemangiomas are considered to be a specific clinical marker of poems syndrome however while they are not pathognomonic their presence should raise suspicion of this syndrome or alert clinicians to its possible future development as these lesions can appear years before the onset of the syndrome we report the cases of 2 women with plasma cell dyscrasias and sudden onset of lesions with a vascular appearance and histologic findings consistent with glomeruloid hemangioma recognition of this vascular tumor is important for the early diagnosis of poems syndrome. poems syndrome is a rare conglomeration of disorders associated with plasma cell dyscrasia the acronym poems is derived from main features of the syndrome namely polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions other clinical features include presence of sclerotic bone lesions castleman s disease papilledema pleural effusion edema ascites erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis myeloma is the most common plasma cell dyscrasia associated with poems syndrome renal involvement is rare and renal biopsy is characterized by glomerular involvement with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and endothelial injury we report a case of a 67 year old male who presented with clinical features satisfying the diagnostic criteria of poems syndrome and had rapidly progressive renal failure renal biopsy showed extensive interstitial infiltration by plasma cells and concomitant presence of classic polyarteritis nodosa although association with small vessel vasculitis has been reported in patients with poems syndrome to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of poems syndrome associated with medium sized vessel vasculitis. poems syndrome also known as crow fukase syndrome represents a rare multisystem syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy m protein and skin changes hypothyroidism is one of the common endocrine abnormalities which are central features of poems syndrome the clinical data associated with the measurement of thyroid function and its clinical significance in poems syndrome is still rare herein we report 24 cases with poems syndrome which were studied thyroid function and clinical manifestations and performed an associated analysis between hypothyroidism and edema effusions of the 24 patients with poems syndrome 17 70 8 had a recognized hypothyroidism including 11 clinical hypothyroidism and 6 subclinical hypothyroidism fourteen patients 58 3 had some form of extravascular volume overload in 14 patients with edema effusions 12 were diagnosed as having hypothyroidism hypothyroidism may be one of causes of edema effusions after thyroid hormone treatment and chemotherapy symptoms of hypothyroidism and edema effusions were improved greatly. we present a case of a woman with unique multisystem disorder poems syndrome and endocrine abnormalities coexisting with it the poems acronym comprises the dominant features polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal protein m protein skin changes association between plasma cell dyscrasia and polyneuropathy was described in 1956 year by crow the main features were coined in the acronym poems by bardwick in 1980 year the polysymptomatic clinical picture progressive course and no concurrent manifestations of main features impede the diagnosis in this case the first symptoms were the sensomotor polyneuropathy peripheral oedema osteosclerotic bone lesions skin changes organomegaly they preceded diagnosis by 3 years the first endocrinopathy was hypothyroidism definite diagnosis was delayed because we couldn t detect the presence of m protein immunoelectrophoresis didn t detect it but analysis by immunofixation detected m protein in serum and urine within 3 years of the first symptoms she developed hypogonadism hypergonadotropic at first the monotherapy with corticosteroids was used then melfalan with prednisone due to the progression of the disease a thalidomide was used in therapy it is anti vegf agent one of the side effects of the treatment of thalidomide is the progression of polyneuropathy which was observed in this patient after finishing this therapy she received chemotherapy this case report imposes the necessity of constants observation of patients with poems syndrome because there is a possibility of their developing other disorders in the event of coexistence polyneuropathy and plasma cell dyscrasia this disease should be taken into consideration.

55184d46622b194345000001	List protein gel staining methods visualizing the entire protein set.	DIGE requires the labelling of proteins by fluorochromes prior to their separation on 2DE gels.  Stains-All (ISA) staining method for phosphoproteins in SDS-PAGE was described.  Pro-Q Diamond stain Quantitative proteome analyses suggest that the well-established stain colloidal Coomassie Blue, when used as an infrared dye, may provide sensitive, post-electrophoretic in-gel protein detection that can rival even Sypro Ruby. Several new fast staining protocols for the visualization of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE utilizing Coomassie Blue staining (CBS) have been described in literature.  The CyDye family of fluorescent dyes is currently the overwhelming choice for applications in proteomic analysis, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) his enables the co-detection of phosphoproteins as well as total proteins from the same gel and is accomplished by utilizing two different fluorescent stains, the ProQ-Diamond, which stains only phosphorylated proteins, and Sypro Ruby, which stains the entire subset of proteins. Detection of the resulting protein maps relies on staining (i.e. colloidal coomassie blue (CCB) or SYPRO Ruby (SR), in addition to many others). Fluorescent in-gel protein stains are generally preferred for higher sensitivity, reduced background, and wider dynamic range. Commonly used staining methods with excellent mass spectrometry compatibility are coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) or fluorescent dyes. The typical concentration of protein loaded varies from 0.13 to 1.40 μg/μL for a classical silver staining method in 2DE gel Silver staining is widely used to detect protein in polyacrylamide gels when high sensitivity is required. Silver staining is used to detect proteins after electrophoretic separation on polyacrylamide gels	[['fluorochromes', 'fluorescence'], ['Sypro Ruby'], ['Colloidal Coomassie Blue'], ['Coomassie Blue'], ['Silver staining'], ['Coomassie Brilliant Blue']]
5517f9286487737b43000002	Which are the different proteins/isoforms encoded but the ASPH (aspartate beta-hydroxylase) gene in humans?	The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing. The human AbetaH-J-J locus is a genomic sequence which generates three functionally distinct proteins, the enzyme aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase (AbetaH), the structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum junctin, and the membrane-bound calcium binding protein junctate. Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) hydroxylates Asp and Asn residues within EGF-like domains of Notch and Jagged, which mediate cell motility and differentiation. This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells. Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctate is a newly identified integral ER/SR membrane calcium binding protein, which is an alternative splicing form of the same gene generating aspartyl beta-hydroxylase and junctin. Screening a mouse heart cDNA library using canine junctin cDNA as a probe yielded three complete mouse heart cDNAs. One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate. Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate). Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously. A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized. The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3.0 and 4.2kb. Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly. The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized. The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain. Evolutionary conservation of this noncatalytic isoform of BAH (humbug) is demonstrated in mouse, man, and Drosophila. The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing Multiple levels of control of the expression of the human A beta H-J-J locus encoding aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase, junctin, and junctate.

550712739d0faaa527000008	Which mutations in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been found to be related to CPVT?	Recently, a novel CPVT RyR2 mutation, G230C, was found to increase the cytosolic, but not the luminal, Ca2+ sensitivity of single RyR2 channels in lipid bilayers. These data suggest that the G230C mutation enhances the propensity for SOICR by sensitizing the channel to luminal and cytosolic Ca2+ activation, and that G230C has an intrinsic structural impact on the N-terminal domains of RyR2. The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays. The S4153R mutation enhanced propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release and reduced SOICR threshold but did not alter Ca(2+) activation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding, a common feature of other CPVT gain-of-function RYR2 mutations. We conclude that the S4153R mutation is a gain-of-function RYR2 mutation associated with a clinical phenotype characterized by both CPVT and atrial fibrillation. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction.  We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)]. We examined AF susceptibility in these three CPVT mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR Ca2+ leak in AF. AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in wild-type (WT) mice (P<0.05). The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a "leaky" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT. A novel CPVT mutation, E189D, was identified. The E189D mutation does not alter the affinity of the channel for FKBP12.6, but it increases the propensity for store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Furthermore, the E189D mutation enhances the basal channel activity of RyR2 and its sensitivity to activation by caffeine. The E189D RyR2 mutation is causative for CPVT and functionally increases the propensity for SOICR without altering the affinity for FKBP12.6. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.   Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals. RyR2 mutations suggested to cause defective Ca2+ channel function have recently been identified in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) affected individuals. We report expression of three CPVT-linked human RyR2 (hRyR2) mutations (S2246L, N4104K, and R4497C) in HL-1 cardiomyocytes displaying correct targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum.  We developed a conditional knock-in mouse model carrier of the R4496C mutation, the mouse equivalent to the R4497C mutations identified in CPVT families, to evaluate if the animals would develop a CPVT phenotype and if beta blockers would prevent arrhythmias. These data provide the first experimental demonstration that the R4496C RyR2 mutation predisposes the murine heart to VT and VF in response caffeine and/or adrenergic stimulation.

52d2818403868f1b06000033	Which are the newly identified DNA nucleases that can be used to treat thalassemia?	Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) DNA editing technology enables site-directed engineering of the genome We used this opportunity to evaluate the effect of total donor homology on transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) mediated bi-allelic modification.  Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. In this study, we used zinc finger nuclease-mediated knockout of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) in MCF7 and AHR knockout in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to investigate cross talk among AHR, ARNT, and estrogen receptor α (ERα).  For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA.  Genome editing using engineered nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) has become a powerful technology for reverse genetics Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free β-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We report here the correction of α-thalassemia major hydrops fetalis in transgene-free iPS cells using zinc finger-mediated insertion of a globin transgene in the AAVS1 site on human chromosome 19.   Here, we review the development of Cas9 as an important tool to not only edit the genomes of a number of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, but also as an efficient system for site-specific transcriptional repression or activation. Additionally, a specific Cas9 protein has been observed to target an RNA substrate, suggesting that Cas9 may have the ability to be programmed to target RNA as well. RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms.  The CRISPR/Cas technology has been successfully used to stimulate the integration of small DNA sequences in a target locus to produce gene mutations.

52fa73e82059c6d71c000059	List the existing methods for genetic manipulation of cells.	For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully. However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing. To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.  Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis. As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes. Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli. Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization. Here, we describe a vector system for efficient multigene assembly and transformation. The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors. By exploiting the CreloxP recombination system and homing endonucleases, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycling were carried out with alternate use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector.
