rapa ests and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of chiifu and rcbr lines despite their huge morphological difference tissue specific expression analysis of briaa genes between the parental lines chiifu and rcbr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud flower and siliqua development stages the response of the briaa genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response single nucleotide polymorphisms between iaa genes of reference genome chiifu and rcbr were focused and identified our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of aux iaa genes and their structures in b rapa analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b
