52bf1f5f03868f1b06000017	What is the action of molindone?	As determined by the new dissociation constants, antipsychotic drugs which elicit Parkinsonism (trifluperazine, chlorpromazine, raclopride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, risperidone) bind more tightly than dopamine to D2, while those antipsychotic drugs which elicit little or no Parkinsonism (melperone, seroquel, perlapine, clozapine, remoxipride, molindone, sulpiride, olanzapine, sertindole) bind more loosely than dopamine to D2 receptors. Compared to the tightly bound antipsychotic drugs, the more loosely bound antipsychotics generally require higher clinical doses, require fewer days for clinical adjustment, but may dissociate from the D2 receptor more rapidly and could lead to clinical relapse somewhat earlier than that found with the traditional tightly bound antipsychotic drugs. All antipsychotic drug treatments examined in this study caused a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex.  Other drugs of the typical (molindone and pimozide) and atypical (remoxipride) classes had no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue.   Loxapine is an alternative when sedation is necessary and molindone is useful if a short-acting antipsychotic is required.  Neuroleptics with a clearly documented liability for producing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, metoclopramide and molindone elevated FLI in the dorsolateral striatum. Pretreatment with molindone (0.45 and 0.8 mg/kg IP), in doses reported to selectively block the presynaptic DA receptors, not only decreased the cataleptic effect of AP but also reversed the AP antagonism of methamphetamine stereotypy.  The antagonist molindone exhibits selectivity for cortical serotonin-stimulated cyclase versus dopamine-stimulated cyclase and may prove useful for further elucidating the sites of lisuride action.  Molindone in low intravenous doses (0.4-0.8 mg/kg) was found to reverse d-amphetamine and apomorphine induced depression of DA neurons and to block apomorphine induced depression of these cells. Molindone was also found to increase dopamine synthesis and dihydroxyphenylactic acid levels in the striatum and olfacotry tubercles. In all of these respects molindone behaves identically to most classical neuroleptics. However, unlike most antipsychotic drugs previously tested, molindone failed to increase the baseline firing rate of DA cells and blocked haloperidol induced increases in DA neuron activity. In this regard molindone most closely resembles thioridazine and clozapine.

530cefaaad0bf1360c000009	What is known about the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring?	In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors - low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The outcome of one study suggested that children with autism were more likely to have a mother who was prescribed an SSRI during pregnancy. A history of maternal (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.08) but not paternal depression was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring. In the subsample with available data on drugs, this association was confined to women reporting antidepressant use during pregnancy (3.34, 1.50 to 7.47, P=0.003), irrespective of whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors were reported. In utero exposure to both SSRIs and non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors (tricyclic antidepressants) was associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, particularly without intellectual disability. Repeated findings of elevated platelet serotonin levels in approximately one third of children with autism has led some to believe that dysfunctional serotonin signaling may be a causal mechanism for the disorder. Because serotonin is critical to fetal brain development, concerns have arisen regarding prenatal exposure to substances that manipulate serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Though the majority of studies conducted in infants and children suggest prenatal exposure to SSRIs does not affect neurodevelopment, interpretation must be tempered given small sample sizes. The only published study that focused on prenatal SSRI exposure and ASD found an increased risk with exposure to SSRIs, especially during the first trimester.  Among the potential environmental factors, hyperserotonemia during pregnancy and its effect on brain development could be playing a role in this prevalence raise. In the rodent model developed by Whitaker-Azmitia and colleagues, hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, affecting the amygdala as well as pro-social hormone oxytocin regulation. Dysfunction of the amygdala and abnormal oxytocin levels may underlie many clinical features of ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the most widely used class of antidepressants drugs, and they are not contraindicated during pregnancy.  In adjusted logistic regression models, we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3]), with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-7.8]). Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low, results suggest that exposure, especially during the first trimester, may modestly increase the risk of ASD.  Together, these results indicate that administration of SSRIs during a sensitive period of brain development results in long-lasting alterations in NE-LC circuit function in adults and may be useful in understanding the etiology of pervasive developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.  Although several studies have not confirmed an increased risk for adverse neurodevelopment, a recent study observed an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in prenatally exposed offspring.  Considering the important role of serotonin in central nervous system development, more studies are needed to assess the possible adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopment.	['Greater risk for autism spectrum disorders has been reported among mothers that have used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. However, others did not find an association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for autism in offspring. Also, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy were associated with a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with autism spectrum disorders.']

55031406e9bde69634000021	What is the risk in G-CSF treatment for severe congenital neutropenia?	We obtained serial hematopoietic samples from an SCN patient who developed AML 17 years after the initiation of G-CSF treatment. Next- generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations during disease progression. In the AML phase, we found 12 acquired nonsynonymous mutations. Three of these, in CSF3R, LLGL2, and ZC3H18, co-occurred in a subpopulation of progenitor cells already in the early SCN phase. This population expanded over time, whereas clones harboring only CSF3R mutations disappeared from the BM. The other 9 mutations were only apparent in the AML cells and affected known AML-associated genes (RUNX1 and ASXL1) and chromatin remodelers (SUZ12 and EP300). In addition, a novel CSF3R mutation that conferred autonomous proliferation to myeloid progenitors was found. We conclude that progression from SCN to AML is a multistep process, with distinct mutations arising early during the SCN phase and others later in AML development. The sequential gain of 2 CSF3R mutations implicates abnormal G-CSF signaling as a driver of leukemic transformation in this case of SCN This chapter focuses on cyclic and congenital neutropenia, two very interesting and rare hematological conditions causing severe chronic neutropenia. Both disorders respond well to treatment with the myeloid growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) Treatment with G-CSF is usually effective, but the dose of G-CSF required to normalize blood neutrophils varies greatly. Ten to thirty percent of severe congenital neutropenia patients evolve to develop acute myeloid leukemia, necessitating careful clinical monitoring. In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), long-term therapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has reduced mortality from sepsis, revealing an underlying predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of infections, but its possible influence on the risk of malignancy is not known No septic deaths occurred during G-CSF therapy. Thirteen cases of MDS/AL were recorded. The cumulative incidence of MDS/AL was 2.7% (SD 1.3%) at 10 years and 8.1% (SD 2.7%) at 20 years Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup Stable long-term risk of leukaemia in patients with severe congenital neutropenia maintained on G-CSF therapy. This specifically applies to children with severe congenital neutropenia who receive lifelong treatment with G-CSF and in which the high susceptibility to develop MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has now become a major clinical concern. Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment	['Severe congenital neutropenia is a rare hematological condition causing severe chronic neutropenia.

56ccccf55795f9a73e000037	What is the role of NETs in systemic lupus erythematosus?	Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent an important defense mechanism against microorganisms. Clearance of NETs is impaired in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and NETosis is increased in neutrophils and, particularly, in low-density granulocytes derived from lupus patients. NETs are toxic to the endothelium, expose immunostimulatory molecules, activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and may participate in organ damage through incompletely characterized pathways. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released via a novel form of cell death called NETosis. NETs, consisting of a chromatin meshwork decorated with antimicrobial peptides, play an important role in the innate response to microbial infections. Some lupus patients do not clear NETs normally, a phenotype that correlates with disease activity. Further, lupus neutrophils - and, in particular, an aberrant subset called low-density granulocytes - have an increased propensity to undergo NETosis.  NETs can also directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis.  Antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are composed of secreted chromatin that may act as a source of autoantigens typical for SLE. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE), since netting neutrophils release potentially immunogenic autoantigens including histones, LL37, human neutrophil peptide (HNP), and self-DNA Elevated Plasma cfDNA May be Associated with Active Lupus Nephritis and Partially Attributed to Abnormal Regulation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus The ability to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is reduced in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) A decreased ability to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is seen in a subgroup of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and correlates with the presence of autoantibodies Recent studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of NETs could be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus Both exuberant NETosis and impaired clearance of NETs have been implicated in the organ damage of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), small vessel vasculitis (SVV), and psoriasis Netting neutrophils induce endothelial damage, infiltrate tissues, and expose immunostimulatory molecules in systemic lupus erythematosus. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is increased in SLE and has been proposed to contribute to endothelial damage, but the mechanism remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which enhanced NET formation by low-density granulocytes (LDGs) in SLE contributes to endothelial damage and disrupts the endothelium.RESULTS: The putative role of NET-externalised matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in altering the functional integrity of the endothelium was examined.  In this study, we investigated how complement interacts with NETs and how NET degradation is affected by complement in SLE patients.  NETs are a potent stimulus for IFNα release by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and, as such, may play an important role in propagation of the lupus phenotype. NETs can also directly damage tissues - including the endothelium - with implications for lupus nephritis and accelerated atherosclerosis. Active NOS, NOX, and MPO within NETs significantly modify HDL, rendering the lipoprotein proatherogenic. Since NET formation is enhanced in SLE, these findings support a novel role for NET-derived lipoprotein oxidation in SLE-associated CVD and identify additional proatherogenic roles of neutrophils and putative protective roles of antimalarials in autoimmunity.	['Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released via a novel form of cell death called NETosis. NETs, consisting of a chromatin meshwork decorated with antimicrobial peptides, play an important role in the innate response to microbial infections. Clearance of NETs is impaired in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and NETosis is increased in these patients low-density granulocytes, a phenotype that correlates with disease activity.

Mycobacterial protein tyrosine kinase, PtkA phosphorylates PtpA at tyrosine residues and the mechanism is stalled by the novel series of inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase (PtkA;TK) activated by autophosphorylation; phosphorylates TP, which subsequently leads to increase in its phosphatase activity Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA).  Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylates Toll-like receptor 4 to dissociate MyD88 and Mal/Tirap, suppressing LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Several studies have revealed that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) can mediate phosphorylation of steroid receptors at multiple sites, including serine 81 of the androgen receptor (AR) Selective inhibition reveals cyclin-dependent kinase 2 as another kinase that phosphorylates the androgen receptor at serine 81. Aurora A kinase phosphorylates Hec1 to regulate metaphase kinetochore-microtubule dynamics. Central to this regulation is Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to promote microtubule turnover. Protein kinases are known primarily for their ability to phosphorylate protein substrates, which constitutes an essential biological process.

Heyde syndrome is a triad of aortic stenosis, acquired coagulopathy, and anemia due to bleeding from intestinal angiodysplasia. Nine patients reported clinically significant bleeding, and seven had intestinal angiodysplasia and transfusion-dependent gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde syndrome), with the median number of transfusions required being 20 (IQR 10-33; range 4-50).  Classical Heyde syndrome is described as the association of aortic stenosis, bleeding gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and secondary anemia.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of aortic valve replacement for reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Heyde syndrome, in whom gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with intestinal angiodysplasia and aortic valve stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between aortic valve stenosis, acquired von Willebrand disease and gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients is known as Heyde syndrome.  Aortic valve stenosis can be complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia.

Heyde syndrome (the combination of iron deficiency anemia and aortic stenosis) has been a controversial entity. The association between aortic valve stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, traditionally known as Heyde's syndrome, is the result of a quantitative loss of the highest molecular weight von Willebrand multimers (type 2A von Willebrand syndrome). The pathophysiology of Heyde's syndrome: an acquired von Willebrand deficiency syndrome has a much wider impact than was commonly thought, both in terms of how common it is and in how the association may be extrapolated to a wide range of bleeding disorders, rather than simply angiodysplasia associated gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

This was taken as good evidence for the maintenance of the chromosome arrangement - the Rabl orientation - and of the peripheral location of the centromere and its association with the nuclear membrane. Within this general arrangement homologous telocentric chromosomes were frequently seen to have their centromeres associated or directed towards each other. The role of the centromere in somatic association as a spindle fibre attachment and chromosome binder is discussed. Homologous chromosomes were spatially separated in nuclei. In large neurons, probes specific for 9q12, or 1q12 showed that at least one homolog was always compartmentalized together with centromeres on the nucleolus, while the second signal either abutted the nucleolus or was on the nuclear membrane  telomeric Yq12 sequence also localized together with perinucleolar centromeres in a completely non-Rabl orientation. We suggest that centromeric and other highly repeated non-transcribed sequence domains may act as general organizing centers for cell type specific interphase patterns that are conserved in mammalian evolution.  Centromere clustering is a major determinant of yeast interphase nuclear organization During interphase in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centromeres are clustered near one pole of the nucleus as a rosette with the spindle pole body at its hub. Unlike the Rabl-orientation known from many higher eukaryotes, centromere clustering in yeast is not only a relic of anaphase chromosome polarization, because it can be reconstituted without the passage of cells through anaphase. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres.  We show that most of this preferential association is not due to vegetative (also known as somatic) pairing but is caused by the polar orientation of interphase chromosomes (Rabl orientation) These developments are discussed in this contribution, with particular reference to the centromere and the nucleolus organizer. The Rabl orientation is an example of the non-random arrangement of chromosomes, centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres. chromosomes are not packed randomly in the nucleus the rabl orientation is an example of the non random arrangement of chromosomes centromeres are grouped in a limited area near the nuclear periphery and telomeres are located apart from centromeres this orientation is established during mitosis and maintained through subsequent interphase in a range of species we report that a rabl like configuration can be formed de novo without a preceding mitosis during the transition from the sexual phase to the vegetative phase of the life cycle in fission yeast in this process each of the dispersed centromeres is often associated with a novel sad1 containing body that is contacting a cytoplasmic microtubule laterally sad1 is a component of the spindle pole body spb the sad1 containing body was colocalized with other known spb components kms1 and spo15 but not with cut12 indicating that it represents a novel spb related complex the existence of the triplex structure centromere microtubule sad1 body suggests that the clustering of centromeres is controlled by a cytoplasmic microtubular system accordingly when microtubules are destabilized clustering is markedly reduced.

Our results show that the adaptation of U1 can correct pathogenic effects of splice donor site mutations and suggest a high potential for gene therapy. Gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 snRNA to correct a RPGR splice defect in patient-derived cells. To correct the splice defect, we developed a gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 small nuclear RNA (U1) Full complementarity of U1 corrects the splice defect partially and increases recognition of the mutant SDS. The therapeutic effect is U1-concentration dependent as we show for endogenously expressed RPGR transcripts in patient-derived cells U1-based gene therapeutic approaches constitute promising technologies to treat SDS mutations in inherited diseases including X-linked RP. Correct mRNA processing at a mutant TT splice donor in FANCC ameliorates the clinical phenotype in patients and is enhanced by delivery of suppressor U1 snRNAs. use of lentiviral vectors as a delivery system to introduce expression cassettes for TT-adapted U1 snRNAs into primary FANCC patient fibroblasts allowed the correction of the DNA-damage-induced G2 cell-cycle arrest in these cells, thus representing an alternative transcript-targeting approach for genetic therapy of inherited splice-site mutations.

54f0985994afd6150400001a	What is known about efficacy of the high dose intravenous ascorbate in the treatment of cancer patients?	Evidence suggests that IVC may be able to modulate inflammation, which in turn might improve outcomes for cancer patients. IVC may serve as a safe, adjunctive therapy in clinical cancer care. SIGNIFICANCE: Ewan Cameron reported that ascorbate, given orally and intravenously at doses of up to 10 g/day, was effective in the treatment of cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment.  RECENT ADVANCES: High dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).   CRITICAL ISSUES: Neither the selective toxicity of pharmacologic ascorbate against cancer cells nor the mechanism of H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity is fully understood. Despite promising preclinical data, the question of clinical efficacy remains.  BACKGROUND: Treatment for pancreatic cancer with pharmacological ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) decreases tumor progression in preclinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest pharmacologic ascorbate administered concurrently with gemcitabine is well tolerated. Initial data from this small sampling suggest some efficacy.  IVC treatments on all aggressive stage cancer patients showed the poor response of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The high dose intravenous ascorbic acid therapy affects C-reactive protein levels and pro-inflammation cytokines in cancer patients. In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. Recent studies have revealed the scientific basis for the use of intravenous (i.v.) vitamin C or ascorbic acid (ascorbate) in treating cancers, and raised the possibility of using i.v. ascorbate as a prooxidant anticancer therapy. Through the production of H2O2, pharmacologic ascorbate can induce some cancer cell death in vitro and inhibit a number of types of tumor growth in animal models. Taken together with previous studies, high-dose ascorbate has the potential to be a novel treatment option to hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Two popular complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine therapies, high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (AA) and intravenous glutathione (GSH), are often coadministered to cancer patients with unclear efficacy and drug-drug interaction. Ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) is one of the early, unorthodox treatments for cancer. The evidence upon which people base the use of ascorbate in cancer treatment falls into two categories: clinical data on dose concentration relationships, and laboratory data describing potential cell toxicity with high concentrations of ascorbate in vitro. Recently, high dose of ascorbate in cancer treatment has been reexamined. These data suggest that ascorbic acid may have benefits for patients with mesothelioma. Although, a couple of controlled clinical studies conducted at The Mayo Clinic did not support a significant benefit for terminal cancer patients after 10 grams of once-a-day oral vitamin C, other clinical trials have demonstrated that ascorbate may indeed be effective against tumors when administered intravenously. Both these regressions coincided exactly in time with intravenous high-dose ascorbate administration, and it seemed reasonable to conclude that this unconventional therapy must have been responsible for his excellent responses. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. In the 1970s, Pauling and Cameron reported increased survival of patients with advanced cancer treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C (L-ascorbate, ascorbic acid). In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients.

54fc97b86ad7dcbc12000002	What is known about clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?	Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Ceftriaxone delays loss of neurons in genetic animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through upregulation of astrocytic glutamate transporter expression (GLT-1). OBJECTIVES: Ceftriaxone increases expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, EAAT2, which might protect from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.  Thirty-four compounds (including riluzole, ceftriaxone, minocyclin, PBA, lithium, acetylcysteine) in human and mouse ALS trials and an additional set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds also showed no effect on SOD1 promoter activity.  Two of these patients received ceftriaxone for 1 month without clinical improvement. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, down-regulation of the astrocyte-specific glutamate excitatory amino acid transporter 2 is hypothesized to increase extracellular glutamate, thereby leading to excitotoxic motor neuron death. The antibiotic ceftriaxone was recently reported to induce excitatory amino acid transporter 2 and to prolong the survival of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 transgenic mice. OBJECTIVE: Ceftriaxone has been reported to reduce neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in an in-vitro model of neuronal ischaemia through increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter, GLT1.  Dysfunction of EAAT2 is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated dementia, and growth of malignant gliomas. Ceftriaxone, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is a stimulator of EAAT2 expression with neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models based in part on its ability to inhibit neuronal cell death by glutamate excitotoxicity.  Motor neuron disease recovery associated with IV ceftriaxone and anti-Babesia therapy. This report summarizes what we believe to be the first verifiable case of a significant and progressive motor neuron disease (MND) consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that resolved during treatment with i.v. ceftriaxone plus oral atovaquone and mefloquine. Other agents (ceftriaxone, minocycline, ONO-2506, and IGF-1 polypeptide) are already in phase III trials involving large numbers of patients with ALS. Ongoing trials are exploring the value of antiglutamatergic agents, including the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone, as well as antioxidants, mitochondrial enhancers and anti-apoptotic drugs.  Recently, Rothstein et al. reported that beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and ceftriaxone, are potential therapeutic drugs to treat some neurological disorders, e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by modulating the expression of glutamate transporter GLT1 via gene activation.  Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity. When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival.  We describe two patients with lateral amyotrophic sclerosis who, after informed consent, received empirical treatment with intravenous cephtriaxone at a dose of 2 g/24 hours for three weeks, with no positive results. Despite promising stage 2 data, stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy.  Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone was evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	['There have been a few case reports to suggest that ceftriaxone can be effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, other case reports did not report clinical benefit of ceftriaxone therapy for ALS.

5d35ef8a7bc3fee31f000002	How are SAHFS created?	These include measurement of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal), senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs), proliferative arrest, morphological changes, and expression and activity of proteins involved in the senescence process, such as p53 and Rb pathway proteins and secretory proteins Redistribution of the Lamin B1 genomic binding profile affects rearrangement of heterochromatic domains and SAHF formation during senescence. Senescent cells have a distinct gene expression profile, which is often accompanied by the spatial redistribution of heterochromatin into senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs)  Genome-wide mapping reveals that LMNB1 is depleted during senescence, preferentially from the central regions of lamina-associated domains (LADs), which are enriched for Lys9 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3). LMNB1 knockdown facilitates the spatial relocalization of perinuclear H3K9me3-positive heterochromatin, thus promoting SAHF formation, which could be inhibited by ectopic LMNB1 expression. nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers characterizes senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) formation in human fibroblasts.  Alterations of chromatin structure are believed to contribute to the irreversible nature of the senescent state. Senescent cells form characteristic heterochromatin structure called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may repress the expression of proliferation-promoting genes, such as E2F target genes. urprisingly, we show that the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins, which can promote tumorigenesis, accumulate on the chromatin of senescent fibroblasts and are essential structural components of SAHFs.  Remarkably, SAHF-positive senescent cells lose linker histone H1 and exhibit increased levels of chromatin-bound high mobility group A2 (HMGA2). Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressing mechanism that is accompanied by characteristic chromatin condensation called senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). It is almost ten years since senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs) were first described in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs).  Thus the layered HOCS of SAHFs is likely achieved mainly through the spatial rearrangement of pre-existing heterochromatin, rather than spreading of heterochromatin. Evidence for the co-association of similar types of chromatin is emerging and SAHFs may provide a unique model system to study the correlation between HOCS and chromatin types, which are readily visible and regulable.	['Cellular senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFS) are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations of linker histone H1 and linker DNA-binding proteins. SAHFS can be formed by a variety of cell types, but their mechanism of action remains unclear.', 'Senescent cells have a distinct gene expression profile, which is often accompanied by the spatial redistribution of heterochromatin into senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs). Their creation goes through the senescence stimulated depletion of LMNB1, which   facilitates the nuclear rearrangement of repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 into nonoverlapping structural layers which characterize senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF).']
589ae59c78275d0c4a000036	What is the function of Oseltamivir when administered during flu?	All patients were given specific antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Oseltamivir (has known by its brand name 'Tamiflu') is a prodrug, requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, Oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir was the first orally active neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed by US based Gilead Sciences and is currently marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche). Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein. US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B. Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu.  The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment.  Though therapeutic dose of oseltamivir was given as antiviral treatment for the early therapy, and other therapeutic measures such as energetic respiratory and circulatory support, and immunosuppressant therapy were given Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP; Tamiflu) is a prodrug of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and has been developed for the treatment and prevention of both A and B strains of influenza. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the most important antiviral drug available and a cornerstone in the defence against a future influenza pandemic. The country where oseltamivir is used most is Japan, where it is used to treat seasonal flu. Oseltamivir safety and tolerability were verified in patients with new variant infection A/H1N1. To investigate oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients who were receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study.Intensive care units of an academic medical center.Thirteen critically ill patients aged 13 years or older with suspected or confirmed H1N1 influenza who had a prescription for oseltamivir and were concurrently receiving CVVHD and/or ECMO between October 2009 and January 2010.Oseltamivir 150 mg was administered nasogastrically or nasoenterically every 12 hours The study included 3351 patients in whom influenza had been diagnosed by use of an antigen detection test kit.Oseltamivir was administered to 1818 patients with influenza A and 1485 patients with influenza B. No anti-influenza drugs were administered to 21 patients with influenza A or to 27 patients with influenza B. Patients receiving oseltamivir therapy were divided into 4 groups according to the time between the onset of fever (temperature, > or = 37.5 degrees C) and administration of the first dose of oseltamivir (0-12 h, 13-24 h, 25-36 h, and 37-48 h) To clarify the usefulness of oseltamivir in the elderly we administered oseltamivir to all residents when an influenza A outbreak occurred in a nursing home.Sixty-eight residents in the nursing home were investigated in which the influenza A outbreak occurred; 32 residents had fever and 28 residents were positive for influenza A with direct enzyme immunoassay.Oseltamivir was administered at 75 mg twice daily for 5 days to all residents.Oseltamivir almost inhibited symptom onset in the influenza A-positive afebrile group Oseltamivir was administered to patients with influenza like illness and confirmed influenza, while their close contacts were given oseltamivir prophylactically Insights from investigating the interaction of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) with neuraminidase of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus. Evaluation of treatment with Oseltamivir during the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic: the problem of incomplete clinical information. Immunological effects of the orally administered neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in influenza virus-infected and uninfected mice. Oral oseltamivir improves pulmonary function and reduces exacerbation frequency for influenza-infected children with asthma. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a potent and selective antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA), a flu protein responsible for the release and spread of the progeny virions. Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein. Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir) are presently used as an anti-flu drugs. US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B. Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu. Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have good number of interactions with H1N1 2009 virus and the scoring function also support to this result. The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions. However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus. Approximately 1.4% of tested isolates are oseltamivir resistant. We report a patient with an underlying hematological malignancy who was hospitalized with influenza A (H1N1) swine-origin and whose strain developed oseltamivir resistance during therapy. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza. Because abnormal behaviors have been observed in some Japanese teenagers following oseltamivir use, its safety has been questioned. Oseltamivir is known to alter neuronal function and behavior in animals, particularly when administered in combination with ethanol. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting. However, neuropsychiatric behaviors including jumping and falling from balconies by young patients being treated by oseltamivir have been reported from Japan; this has led to warnings against its prescribing by many authorities. However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus. We observed also 10 infections A/H1N1 influenza during pregnancy, with good oseltamivir tolerance and without recent perinathal complications.CONCLUSIONS: Among 109 individuals with swine flu influenza, 67% have not complicated clinical manifestation and they recovered during 3-4 days. The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009.. Most reported that oseltamivir was an effective treatment for the flu. It is needed to perform surveillance on oseltamivir resistance in swine flu. The neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus is the target of anti-flu drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. According to one trial, oseltamivir was moderately effective as a prophylactic for close contacts of 'flu cases (6.6% in absolute values). Oseltamivir: a first line defense against swine flu. Oseltamivir administered daily for six weeks by the oral route is safe and effective for the prevention of influenza..

5c66329e7c78d6947100000f	What is the mechanism of action of durvalumab?	In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the godfather of checkpoint inhibitors, whereas several blocking monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and BMS-946559) have been developed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicities in patients with metastatic UC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies may provide overall survival advantage; these are currently being evaluated in ongoing phase 3 studies.  METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.2). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a key component of treating advanced cancer patients, principally antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a selective, high-affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 and CD80, but not to PD-L2. However, it is still unknown how atezolizumab and durvalumab specifically recognize PD-L1, although this is important for investigating novel binding sites on PD-L1 targeted by other therapeutic antibodies for the design and improvement of anti-PD-L1 agents. Here, we report the crystal structures of PD-L1 in complex with atezolizumab and durvalumab to elucidate the precise epitopes involved and the structural basis for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade by these antibodies. In 2016 and 2017, monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-L1, including atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab, were approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple advanced cancers. We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers. Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab might provide greater antitumour activity than either drug alone. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and CD80, blocking PD-L1, but not PD-L2. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab. Durvalumab is a human IgG1-K monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and locally advanced, unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer. Other notable PD-L1 inhibitors under development include avelumab and durvalumab. Combining the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody tremelimumab offers the potential for antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor status. Five antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1--programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1--PD-L1) pathway have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of various malignancies: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab. Currently, the only FDA-approved indication for the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab (MEDI-4736) is locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed during or following platinum-based chemotherapy within 12 months of treatment. Intravenous durvalumab (Imfinzi™; AstraZeneca) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed cell death ligand-1 binding to its receptors (PD-1 and CD80), resulting in enhanced T-cell responses against cancer cells. Here, we report a meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736), an inhibitor of PD-L1, in various solid tumors.

Magnetic sphincter augmentation with the LINX device for gastroesophageal reflux disease after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. Magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) of the gastroesophageal junction with the LINX Reflux Management System is an alternative to fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2012.  Is the LINX reflux management system an effective treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease? BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) with the LINX device is a promising new therapy for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Other nonmedical therapies include, the Stretta procedure, transoral incisionless fundoplication, and the magnetic sphincter augmentation device (LINX).  LINX(®) Reflux Management System in chronic gastroesophageal reflux: a novel effective technology for restoring the natural barrier to reflux.

5e35cb27158f994d3a000002	What are the puQTLs (promoter-usage Quantitative Trait Loci)?	The identification of genetic variants affecting gene expression, namely expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), has contributed to the understanding of mechanisms underlying human traits and diseases. The majority of these variants map in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome and their identification remains challenging. Here, we use natural genetic variation and CAGE transcriptomes from 154 EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from unrelated individuals, to map 5376 and 110 regulatory variants associated with promoter usage (puQTLs) and enhancer activity (eaQTLs), respectively. We characterize five categories of genes associated with puQTLs, distinguishing single from multi-promoter genes. Among multi-promoter genes, we find puQTL effects either specific to a single promoter or to multiple promoters with variable effect orientations. Regulatory variants associated with opposite effects on different mRNA isoforms suggest compensatory mechanisms occurring between alternative promoters. Our analyses identify differential promoter usage and modulation of enhancer activity as molecular mechanisms underlying eQTLs related to regulatory elements.

On the LCV, AnkB triggers docking of K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins that are degraded by the host proteasomes to elevate cellular levels of amino acids needed for intracellular proliferation.  Transcription and injection of ankB is triggered by attached extracellular bacteria followed by rapid farnesylation and anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane beneath bacterial attachment, where K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins are assembled and degraded by the proteasomes, leading to a rapid rise in the cellular levels of amino acids. Although it has been known for a long time that ubiquitylation has a major role in the activation and regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, recent studies have revealed that the picture is a lot more complex than originally thought. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins.  The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  Covalent and reversible post-translational modifications of proteins are a common theme in signaling. Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues. Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system. Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery	['The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.

550300fce9bde6963400000a	What is known about food intolerance and gluten ?	At present, there is no specific bio-marker of gluten sensitivity. Emerging research into a syndrome known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity suggests a heterogeneous condition with some features of celiac disease but often categorized as FGIDs, including IBS. Celiac disease, with a prevalence around 1% of the general population, is the most common genetically-induced food intolerance in the world. Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, Gluten intolerance is a unique model of autoimmune disease in which we can recognize the main environmental factor (gluten) and the more complex genetic background. Coeliac disease is a multifactorial disease characterized by a dysregulated immune response to ingested wheat gluten and related cereal proteins. With an incidence of about 1% of the general population, it is considered the most common food intolerance disorder. Coeliac disease is a lifelong intolerance to the gluten found in wheat, barley and rye, and some patients are also sensitive to oats. The disease is genetically determined, with 10% of the first-degree relatives affected and 75% of monozygotic twins being concordant.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR has been successfully utilised to efficiently correct the Cdh23 (ahl) allele in C57BL/6NTac mice, and rescue the associated auditory phenotype. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to genetically correct the MYO15A mutation in the iPSCs and rescued the morphology and function of the derived hair cell-like cells.  Our recent work has shown CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear in vivo.

The correction of gene mutations in iPSCs could restore the normal function of cells and provide a rich source of cells for transplantation. the present study might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of sensorineural hearing loss and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies against monogenic disease through the genetic repair of patient-specific iPSCs.

58d131218acda34529000005	What is the role of peptide aptamers?	Peptide aptamers: The versatile role of specific protein function inhibitors in plant biotechnology.  These artificial short peptides are able to specifically bind, track, and inhibit a given target molecule with high affinity, even molecules with poor immunogenicity or high toxicity, and represent a remarkable alternative to antibodies in many different applications.  To inhibit the oncogenic action of Stat3 in tumor cells, we have selected short peptides, so-called peptide aptamers, which specifically interact with defined functional domains of this transcription factor.  Aptasensors utilize aptamers as bioreceptors. Aptamers are highly efficient, have a high specificity and are reusable. Within the biosensor the aptamers are immobilized to maximize their access to target molecules. Knowledge of the orientation and location of the aptamer and peptide during binding could be gained through computational modeling.  Understanding orientation and location of the binding region for a peptide-aptamer complex is critical in their biosensor applicability.  Our study clearly demonstrates the ability of MD simulations to obtain molecular insights for peptide-aptamer binding, and to provide details on the orientation and location of binding between the peptide-aptamer that can be instrumental in biosensor development. Peptide aptamers are artificial short peptides that potentially interfere with the biological roles of their target proteins; however, this technology has not yet been applied to plant functional genomics. To extend such strategies we selected peptide aptamers binding to PrP from a combinatorial peptide library presented on the Escherichia coli thioredoxin A (trxA) protein as a scaffold. These peptide aptamers retained their binding properties to PrPc and, depending on peptide sequence and C-terminal modification, interfered with endogenous PrPSc conversion upon expression in prion-infected cells. Binding to the nonfarnesylated peptide was at least 10-fold weaker, showing that the aptamers can recognize the hydrophobic farnesyl moiety. Peptide aptamers: exchange of the thioredoxin-A scaffold by alternative platform proteins and its influence on target protein binding. Typically, peptide aptamers are generated by screening a randomized peptide expression library, displayed from the Escherichia coli thioredoxin A (TrxA) protein. Peptide aptamers define distinct EB1- and EB3-binding motifs and interfere with microtubule dynamics. Reverse analysis with peptide aptamers involves isolating aptamers that interact with a specific protein and monitoring the resulting aptamer-induced phenotype. Peptide aptamers are combinatorial protein reagents that bind to targets with a high specificity and a strong affinity thus providing a molecular tool kit for modulating the function of their targets in vivo.Here we report the isolation of a peptide aptamer named swiggle that interacts with the very short (21 amino acid long) intracellular domain of membrane type 1-metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a key cell surface protease involved in numerous and crucial physiological and pathological cellular events Peptide aptamers are simple structures, often made up of a single-variable peptide loop constrained within a constant scaffold protein Peptide aptamers are small peptide sequences that have been selected to recognise a predetermined target protein domain and are potentially able to interfere with its function Aptamers, including DNA, RNA and peptide aptamers, are a group of promising recognition units that can specifically bind to target molecules and cells Aptamers are a group of molecules, which can specifically bind, track, and inhibit target molecules, comprising DNA aptamers, RNA aptamers, and peptide aptamers Peptide aptamers: The versatile role of specific protein function inhibitors in plant biotechnology Peptide aptamers are small proteins containing a randomized peptide sequence embedded into a stable protein scaffold, such as Thioredoxin Peptide aptamers can subsequently be used to guide the discovery of small molecule drugs specific for these molecular surfaces.Here, we present a high-throughput screening assay that identifies small molecules that displace interactions between proteins and their cognate peptide aptamers These peptide aptamers are target-specific peptides expressed within a protein scaffold engineered from the human protease inhibitor stefin A. The scaffold provides stability to the inserted peptides and increases their binding affinity owing to the resulting three-dimensional constraints Isolation of Peptide aptamers to target protein function.

Peptides and aptamers targeting HSP70: a novel approach for anticancer chemotherapy. Peptide aptamers targeting the hepatitis B virus core protein: a new class of molecules with antiviral activity. These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing. Therapeutic application depends on binding specificities and affinities, as well as on the production and purification characteristics of the peptide aptamers and their delivery into cells. While antibodies are known to recognize the sequence and conformation of protein surface features (epitopes), very little is known about the precise interactions between aptamers and their epitopes. Monomeric recombinant peptide aptamers are required for efficient intracellular uptake and target inhibition. The use of small peptide aptamers to competitively inhibit protein interaction and function is becoming increasingly recognized as a powerful technique. For the first time, we show that trxA-based peptide aptamers can be targeted to the secretory pathway, thereby not losing the affinity for their target protein. Moreover, the aptamers appeared to be able to bind peptides with different solution conformations, implying an induced fit mechanism for binding. Peptide aptamers are small proteins containing a randomized peptide sequence embedded into a stable protein scaffold, such as Thioredoxin. Peptide aptamers are the newest in the class of "genetic" agents that aid in the analysis of cellular processes.

53175e68b166e2b806000009	What is the effect of ROS on cyclin B1?	The present study was undertaken to determine whether sulforaphane-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) might cause growth arrest and apoptosis in human bladder cancer 5637 cells. Our results show that the reduced viability of 5637 cells by sulforaphane is due to mitotic arrest, but not the G2 phase. The sulforaphane-induced mitotic arrest correlated with an induction of cyclin B1 and phosphorylation of Cdk1, as well as a concomitant increased complex between cyclin B1 and Cdk1. Further mechanistic studies revealed that induction of apoptosis is associated with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to cytosol, upregulation of Bax, p21 and p53, and down-regulation of Bcl-2, cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). LDH inhibition by oxamate induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via downregulation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 pathway and promoted apoptosis through enhancement of mitochondrial ROS generation. N-acetylcysteine, a specific scavenger of ROS, significantly blocked the growth inhibition effect induced by oxamate. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Butyrate (> 2 mm) inhibited the expression of cdc2, cdc25C and cyclinB1 mRNAs and reduced the levels of Cdc2, Cdc25C and cyclinB1 proteins in GFs, as determined using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. This toxic effect of butyrate was associated with the production of ROS. Furthermore, costunolide induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase via decrease in Cdc2, cyclin B1 and increase in p21WAF1 expression, In addition, costunolide had a slight induced effect on ROS generation. This study suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest was triggered by ROS/NO productions with regulations of p53, p21, cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which were able to be prevented by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity inhibitor genistein or JNK inhibitor SP600125. Other G(2)/M regulatory molecules such as Cdc25C, Cdk1, cyclin B1 were down-regulated by DIM. Blocking ROS generation by N-acetyl cysteine protects the cells from DIM-mediated G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that emodin mediated oxidative injury (DNA damage) based on ROS production and ER stress based on the levels of GADD153 and GRP78 that acts as an early and upstream change in the cell death cascade to caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways, triggers mitochondrial dysfunction from Bcl-2 and Bax modulation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation, consequently leading to apoptosis in SCC-4 cells. In this study, treatment of human tongue cancer SCC-4 cells with various concentrations of emodin led to G2/M arrest through promoted p21 and Chk2 expression but inhibited cyclin B1 and cdc2; Further investigation revealed that plumbagin's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Blockade of cell cycle was associated with increased levels of p21, and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, Cdc2, and Cdc25C. We also found the generation of ROS is a critical mediator in plumbagin-induced cell growth inhibition. IOA exhibited effective cell growth inhibition by inducing cancer cells to undergo G(2)-M phase arrest and apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that IOA's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Cell cycle blockade was associated with increased levels of p21 and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2, and cdc25C. We also found that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical mediator in IOA-induced cell growth inhibition.

Treatment with vitamin C led to rapid recovery of symptoms.   Scurvy, or "Barlow's disease", is a widely described disease involving cutaneous and mucosal lesions resulting from vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy, a disease of dietary deficiency of vitamin C, is uncommon today. Because many of the early symptoms of vitamin C deficiency (fatigue, malaise, depression and irritability) are non-specific, the diagnostic possibility of scurvy is usually delayed until haemorrhagic manifestations occur. Scurvy is caused by prolonged dietary deficiency of vitamin C, the plasma concentration of which appears inversely related to mortality from all causes Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man Ascorbic acid is a vitamin soluble in water and its deficiency in human body causes scurvy. Deficiencies in vitamin C can lead to conditions such as scurvy, which, among other ailments, causes gingivia, bone pain, and impaired wound healing. Severe deficiency leads to scurvy, whereas a limited vitamin C intake causes general symptoms, such as increased susceptibility to infections, fatigue, insomnia, and weight loss. Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy a serious and painful disease in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong connective tissue, gums deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and wounds do not heal. The human body is unable to synthesise Vitamin C and a diet deficient in Vitamin C leads to scurvy. Scurvy may mimic other medical conditions, like bleeding diasthesis or deep vein thrombosis, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment, thus prolonging sufferings of patients. Often, scurvy could have been diagnosed if it is thought of and features of scurvy carefully looked for. Scurvy, a disease of dietary deficiency of vitamin C, is uncommon today. Among diseases, scurvy has a rich history and an ancient past. Scurvy may mimic other medical conditions, like bleeding diasthesis or deep vein thrombosis, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment, thus prolonging sufferings of patients. Often, scurvy could have been diagnosed if it is thought of and features of scurvy carefully looked for. Scurvy is easily treated with high dose of oral vitamin C.

Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics of erdafitinib, a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors. Introduction This phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, dose-escalation study aimed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493), an oral selective pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose in Japanese patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.  Findings from a phase II study indicate clinical efficacy with erdafitinib in patients with FGFR-altered inoperable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Robust responses were seen with this investigational pan-FGFR inhibitor, including in patients who did not respond to prior immunotherapy. In a phase 1 clinical trial, erdafitinib, a pan FGFR inhibitor, was well tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile.  Co-cultured fibroblasts promoted SW620 and HCT116 CRC spheroid invasion, and this was prevented by the SRC and FGFR kinase inhibitors Dasatinib and Erdafitinib, respectively. Discovery and Pharmacological Characterization of JNJ-42756493 (Erdafitinib), a Functionally Selective Small-Molecule FGFR Family Inhibitor. JNJ-42756493, erdafitinib, is an orally active small molecule with potent tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity against all four FGFR family members and selectivity versus other highly related kinases.  Oncogenic Characterization and Pharmacologic Sensitivity of Activating Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) Genetic Alterations to the Selective FGFR Inhibitor Erdafitinib. Pathway inhibition in response to FGFR inhibitor treatment was assessed in cell lines (both in vitro and in vivo) and in samples from patients treated with the FGFR inhibitor JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib). Tumor cells expressing these FGFR activating mutants displayed sensitivity to the selective FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib and resulted in suppression of FGFR phosphorylation and downstream signal transduction.  Erdafitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR1-4, has shown antitumor activity in preclinical models and in a phase 1 study involving patients with  __i_tag__ FGFR __end_i_tag__  alterations. Erdafitinib (Balversa™, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies) is a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor that was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic FGFR3 or FGFR2 urothelial carcinoma.

517151f28ed59a060a000008	What is the correlation between SPARC expression and growth inhibition in human cancer?	Using a chemical carcinogenesis model in Sparc-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates, we found that loss of SPARC accelerated the development of urothelial preneoplasia (atypia and dysplasia), neoplasia, and metastasis and was associated with decreased survival. Our studies showed that inhibition of HDAC decreased NB proliferation, and induced caspase activity and G1 growth arrest. Expression patterns of cancer-related genes were modulated by VPA. The expression of THBS1, CASP8, SPARC, CDKN1A, HIC1, CDKN1B, and HIN1 was upregulated, and that of MYCN and TIG1 was downregulated. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of SPARC inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation. Concomitantly, SPARC was upregulated in all ccRCC cells, suggesting that Ukrain could also affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition, as supported by the cell cycle analysis, as SPARC also acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. SPARC silencing in IM-R cells restored imatinib sensitivity, whereas enforced SPARC expression in imatinib-sensitive cells promoted viability as well as protection against imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Notably, we found that the protective effect of SPARC required intracellular retention inside cells We found that depletion of SPARC induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition with activation of p53 and induction of p21(Cip1/Waf1) acting as a checkpoint, preventing efficient mitotic progression. Knockdown of SPARC expression in H322 and A549 cells led to suppression of cell invasion, comparable to that observed in KLF4-transfected cells. Moreover, retrovirus-mediated restoration of SPARC expression in KLF4-transfected cells abrogated KLF4-induced anti-invasion activity. Together, our results indicate that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell invasion by suppressing SPARC gene expression. To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation In vivo experiments revealed that SPARC overexpression in HCC cells inhibited their tumorigenic capacity and increased animal survival through a mechanism that partially involves host macrophages. Our data suggest that SPARC overexpression in HCC cells results in a reduced tumorigenicity partially through the induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Finally, we demonstrated that SPARC, which has been previously associated with meningioma invasiveness, was increased in aggressive meningiomas. We found that the leukemic cells of AML patients with MLL gene rearrangements express low to undetectable amounts of SPARC whereas normal hematopoietic progenitors and most AML patients express this gene. SPARC RNA and protein levels were also low or undetectable in AML cell lines with MLL translocations. Consistent with its tumor suppressive effects in various solid tumor models, exogenous SPARC protein selectively reduced the growth of cell lines with MLL rearrangements by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. These data indicate that SPARC plays an essential role in tumor evasion from immune surveillance through the inhibition of the antitumor PMN activity. We conclude that SPARC is inhibitory to human breast cancer cell proliferation, and does not stimulate migration, in contrast to its stimulatory effects reported for melanoma (proliferation and migration) and glioma (migration) cells. Similar growth repression by SPARC has been reported for ovarian cancer cells, and this may be a common feature among carcinomas. Furthermore, SPARC delayed but did not inhibit tumor growth. The patterns of invasion and the extent of growth delay correlated with the level of SPARC expression.	['Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a multi-faceted protein-modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. SPARC seems to act as a tumour suppressor, as it has been found that loss of SPARC accelerates the development of certain types of cancer, whereas its expression impairs tumor growth. However it has also been associated with a aggressive phenotypes of some tumours. The role of SPARC may depend on its subcellular localization.']
5ab908d4fcf456587200001a	What is the alternative lengthening of telomeres?	By comparing these ALT cells with parental telomerase positive cells, we observed that ALT cells possess excessively long telomeric overhangs derived from telomere elongation processes that mostly occur during S phase. ALT cells exhibited preferential elongation of the telomeric lagging strands, whereas telomerase positive cells exhibited similar elongation between leading and lagging strands. We propose that the ALT pathway preferentially occurs at telomeric lagging strands leading to heterogeneous telomere lengths observed in most ALT cancers. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase independent telomere maintenance mechanism that occurs in ∼15% of cancers.

Protection against infection and maintenance of homeostasis are the hallmarks of the innate immune system. The complex signaling cascades that occur following microbial infection have been studied intensely for a number of years and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) represent novel regulatory components of these pathways. Over the last decade, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a fundamental molecular class whose members play pivotal roles in the regulation of the genome. Through their numerous functions, lncRNAs play critical roles in the growth, development, senescence, death, and other important physiological and pathological processes. lncRNAs usually function through interactions with proteins, which implies the importance of identifying the binding proteins of lncRNAs in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of lncRNAs. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are involved in multiple processes critical to normal cellular function and dysfunction of lncRNA MIAT may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. lncRNAs function as adaptors that link specific chromatin loci with chromatin-remodeling complexes and transcription factors. The results indicate that lncRNA-CIR contributes to ECM degradation and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OA. We propose that lncRNA-CIR could be used as a potential target in OA therapy.

5a7242a22dc08e987e00000e	Describe swirl sign in intracerebral hemorrhage.	Univariate analysis showed that the presence of extravasation on CT, large initial hematoma size (>30 mL), the presence of "swirl sign" on NCCT, the Glasgow Coma Scale and ICH scores, and international normalized ratio were associated with increased mortality. BACKGROUND: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.   61% of patients with swirl sign were dead at one month compared with 21% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Only 19% of patients with swirl sign exhibited favorable outcome at three months compared with 53% of those with no swirl sign (p<0.001). Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p<0.001). Swirl sign was independent predictor of death at one month (p = 0.03; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 - 6), and functional outcome at three months (p = 0.045; adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.02 - 6.5).CONCLUSIONS: As swirl sign showed to be an ominous sign, we recommend identification of this sign in cases of ICHs. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape.  Risk of evolution toward BD was classified as low (corneal reflexes present and no swirl sign), high (≥1 corneal reflexes abolished and swirl sign), and intermediate. Patients with swirl sign exhibited larger ICHs with average ICH-volume 52 ± 50 ml (median 42 ml) compared with 15 ± 25 ml (median 6) in patients whose CT did not show swirl sign (p < 0.001). <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Swirl sign has previously been described in epidural hematomas as areas of low attenuation, radiolucency or irregular density.

Human salivary histatins, including histatin 5 (Hst 5), are small cationic proteins that are the major source of fungicidal activity of saliva Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant. Since Hst 5 requires fungal binding to cell wall components prior to intracellular translocation, reduced Hst 5 binding to C. glabrata may be the reason for its insensitivity. Hst 5 enters C. albicans cell through polyamine transporters Dur3p and Dur31p that are uncharacterized in C. glabrata.  the crucial rate limiting step is reduced uptake that can be overcome by expression of C. albicans Dur proteins in C. glabrata. Histatin 5, a human salivary protein with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, is remarkably ineffective against Candida glabrata. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that histatin-5 possessed the fungicidal activity against Candida species other than C. glabrata. The present study shows that a number of basic antifungal peptides, including human salivary histatin 5, a designed histatin analog designated dhvar4, and a peptide from frog skin, PGLa, are active against amphotericin B-resistant Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Aspergillus fumigatus strains and against a fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata isolate. In addition, we tested azole-resistant C. albicans and Candida glabrata strains for their susceptibilities to Hsn-5. Assessment of the candidacidal activity of Hsn-5 with the well-characterized azole-resistant strains of C. albicans and C. glabrata, however, suggested that the mode of action of histatins against Candida is distinct from that of azole-based antifungal agents because Hsn-5 kills both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains equally well. Histatin 5 resistance of Candida glabrata can be reversed by insertion of Candida albicans polyamine transporter-encoding genes DUR3 and DUR31. Roles of cellular respiration, CgCDR1, and CgCDR2 in Candida glabrata resistance to histatin 5. Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant.  Biofilms of C. glabrata GDH1407 and 6115/06 were less susceptible to histatin 5, with 50% RMA of 31.2 +/- 4.8 and 62.5 +/- 0.7 microM, respectively.  Thus, neither C. glabrata cell surface or biofilm matrix β-1,3-glucan levels affected Hst 5 toxicity; rather the crucial rate limiting step is reduced uptake that can be overcome by expression of C. albicans Dur proteins in C. glabrata. These results indicate that histatin 5 exhibits antifungal activity against biofilms of C. albicans and C. glabrata developed on denture acrylic.  Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are predominant fungi associated with oral candidiasis.  C. glabrata is significantly less sensitive to histatin 5 than C. albicans. We investigated whether the distinct resistance of C. glabrata to histatin 5 is related to similar mechanisms. The authors report a case of disseminated candidiasis due to Candida glabrata with liver metastases.

553ccbaef32186855800000f	Describe the involvement of conserved noncoding sequences in the regulation of Hox genes.	 The data presented herein identify many noncoding sequence motifs conserved over 800 million years that may function as genetic control motifs essential to the developmental process by comparing conserved noncoding sequences upstream of these exons in different species, we were able to identify homology between some exons. Some alternative splicing variants are probably very ancient and were already coded for by the ancestral Hox gene cluster Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes the b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes Unexpectedly large number of conserved noncoding regions within the ancestral chordate Hox cluster We found that Hox intergenic regions are largely conserved between the two amphioxus species, especially in the case of genes located at the 3' of the cluster, a trend previously observed in vertebrates We further compared the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters, finding several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. This suggests that the regulation of Hox genes is highly conserved across chordates, consistent with the similar Hox expression patterns in vertebrates and amphioxus Highly conserved syntenic blocks at the vertebrate Hox loci and conserved regulatory elements within and outside Hox gene clusters A large number of CNS was identified within the Hox clusters and outside the Hox clusters spread over large regions. The CNS include previously characterized enhancers and overlap with the 5' global control regions of HoxA and HoxD clusters. Most of the CNS are likely to be control regions involved in the regulation of Hox and other genes in these loci.

The b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs.  Elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.  When compared, the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters were found to have several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions. This suggests that the regulation of Hox genes is highly conserved across chordates, consistent with the similar Hox expression patterns in vertebrates and amphioxus.']

515dbb3b298dcd4e51000018	How histone deacetylation causes transcriptional gene silencing?	Lysine acetylation of histones is one of the major epigenetic regulators of chromatin conformation and gene expression. The dynamic nature of histone acetylation is determined by the counterbalancing activity of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. Acetylation of histones is generally associated with open and transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the activity of HDACs leads to histone deacetylation, condensation of chromatin, and inhibition of transcription. Abnormal activity of HDACs has been implicated in tumorigenesis and therefore considerable effort has been put into the development of HDAC inhibitors as a means of modifying histone acetylation status and reexpressing aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes. Histone acetylation and deacetylation play essential roles in eukaryotic gene regulation. Reversible modifications of core histones are catalyzed by two intrinsic enzymes, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HD). In general, histone deacetylation is related to transcriptional gene silencing, whereas acetylation correlates with gene activation. The reversible nature of deregulated chromatin structure by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation inhibitors, leading to re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, makes chromatin-remodeling pathways as promising therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), recovered the expression and function of NEO1 in the silenced lines, suggesting that histone deacetylation is essential for the direct suppression of target genes by DNAi. We had previously shown that in anergic CD4(+) T cells, Ikaros participates in the transcriptional repression of the Il2 gene by recruiting histone deacetylases that cause core histone deacetylation at the Il2 promoter. Here we show that deacetylation at the Il2 promoter is the initial step in a process that leads to the stable silencing of the Il2 gene transcription in anergic T cells. We demonstrate that HP1 forms distinct DNA methylation and histone deacetylation complexes that work in parallel to assemble silent chromatin in N. crassa. These results indicated that histone deacetylation is a silencing mechanism for GATA4 expression in AFP-producing gastric cancer cells. We found that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) increases the expression levels of mature miRNAs despite repressing the transcription of host genes. Promoter methylation and histone deacetylation were studied as possible mechanisms for klotho silencing. Taken together, these data indicate loss of klotho expression as an early event in breast cancer development, and suggest a role for DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in klotho silencing. DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and nonepigenetic phenomenon DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and nonepigenetic phenomenon. Because DNA hypermethylation-based silencing may couple with and depend on histone deacetylation, our study suggests that endogenous HDAC inhibition by maspin may prevent pathologic gene silencing in prostate tumor progression. Epigenetic regulation of the IL-13-induced human eotaxin-3 gene by CREB-binding protein-mediated histone 3 acetylation. Heterochromatin impacts various nuclear processes by providing a recruiting platform for diverse chromosomal proteins. In fission yeast, HP1 proteins Chp2 and Swi6, which bind to methylated histone H3 lysine 9, associate with SHREC (Snf2/HDAC repressor complex) and Clr6 histone deacetylases (HDACs) involved in heterochromatic silencing. We established that the silencing of these genes in UVB-exposed epidermis and UVB-induced skin tumors is associated with a network of epigenetic modifications, including hypoacetylation of histone H3 and H4 and increased histone deacetylation, as well as recruitment of methyl-binding proteins, including MeCP2 and MBD1, to the methylated CpGs. Histone deacetylation directs DNA methylation in survivin gene silencing. Next, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in survivin silencing after blockade of histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA). The results showed that histone deacetylation blocked by TSA reversed the increasing effect of histone deacetylation on the expression of survivin mRNA. Aberrant hypermethylation at CpG sites within the CDKN2A gene is associated with silencing and has been proposed as a target for reactivation using both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation inhibitors. Mechanisms of HDA6-mediated rRNA gene silencing: suppression of intergenic Pol II transcription and differential effects on maintenance versus siRNA-directed cytosine methylation. The Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA6 is required to silence transgenes, transposons, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes subjected to nucleolar dominance in genetic hybrids. Distinct and temporal roles of nucleosomal remodeling and histone deacetylation in the repression of the hTERT gene. Surprisingly, inhibition of histone deacetylation at the hTERT promoter did not prevent hTERT repression or nucleosomal deposition, indicating that nucleosomal deposition at the core promoter, but not histone deacetylation, was the cause of transcriptional repression. Our data also suggested that succeeding nucleosomal remodeling and histone deacetylation worked in parallel to establish the stable repressive status of hTERT gene in human somatic cells. Reconstitution of heterochromatin-dependent transcriptional gene silencing. Silencing requires all three Sir proteins, even with fully deacetylated chromatin, and involves the specific association of Sir3 with deacetylated H4K16. These results define a minimal set of components that mediate heterochromatic gene silencing and demonstrate distinct contributions for histone deacetylation and nucleosome binding in the silencing mechanism. Silencing requires all three Sir proteins, even with fully deacetylated chromatin, and involves the specific association of Sir3 with deacetylated H4K16. These results define a minimal set of components that mediate heterochromatic gene silencing and demonstrate distinct contributions for histone deacetylation and nucleosome binding in the silencing mechanism Inhibition of histone deacetylase suppresses EGF signaling pathways by destabilizing EGFR mRNA in ER-negative human breast cancer cells. Our previous studies demonstrate that histone deacetylation plays a key role in ER gene silencing, and ER expression can be restored with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in ER-negative human breast cancer cells. This chromatin pattern, and particularly H3K4me2 levels, crisply separates DNA-hypermethylated genes from those where histone deacetylation is responsible for transcriptional silencing. Loss of gene expression is not due to structural mutations, but to regulatory changes including epigenetic deacetylation of histones. We found that these PERV families are differentially up- or downregulated upon chemical inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in cultured porcine cells. The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as transcriptional repressors by altering chromatin structure through histone deacetylation. The Set3 histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) binds histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) to mediate deacetylation of histones in 5'-transcribed regions. Core histone modifications play an important role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate that the acetylation/deacetylation balance strongly influences the expression of arginase-1, a gene of alternative activation of macrophages. MTA1 acts as part of a nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. The ectopic expression of ThPOK resulted in increased recruitment of histone deacetylases at Cd8 loci; the enhanced deacetylation of Cd8 genes eventually led to impaired Cd8 transcription. Sirt-1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase, has been linked to transcriptional silencing and appears to play a key role in inflammation. OBJECTIVE: Histone deacetylation regulates chromatin remodeling and transcriptional down-regulation of specific genomic regions; it is altered in many types of cancer cells. Histone acetylations affect the regulation of gene transcription, and the loss of learning induced deacetylation at specific histone sites may represent biomarkers for memory loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing chromatin accessibility via inhibition of histone deacetylation or DNA methylation lowered the induction threshold, demonstrating that chromatin accessibility sets the level of RelA required to activate gene expression. The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 antagonizes p53 transcriptional activity to regulate cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. These studies reveal a new mechanism by which acetyltransferase activity induces gene expression through targeted destruction of a transcriptional repressor. Further studies indicated that GR recruited histone deacetylase 1 to the Runx2 P2 promoter which then mediated the deacetylation of histone H4 and down-regulated Runx2 expression. RUNX2 cofactors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription. In some cell lines latently infected with EBV, an HDAC inhibitor alone can induce BZLF1 transcription, while the treatment does not enhance expression in other cell lines, such as B95-8 or Raji cells, suggesting unknown suppressive mechanisms besides histone deacetylation in those cells. Furthermore, the deacetylation of p53 by EWS-Fli1 suppressed its transcriptional activity and enhanced mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This finding suggests that HDACs have two arms for gene silencing: transcriptional repression by promoter histone deacetylation and post-transcriptional inhibition by increasing miRNA abundance. Promoter-localized deacetylation of H3 tails is a prerequisite for VprBP to tether and act as a bona fide inhibitor at p53 target genes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply an important role for histone deacetylation in the downregulation of E-cadherin in human pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of transcription results from the release of p300 coactivator from NF-κB target gene promoters and subsequent histone deacetylation. In fungi in general, gene expression is often partially controlled at the chromatin level in secondary metabolism; when this is the case, the deacetylation and acetylation (and other posttranslational modifications) of histones are usually crucial in the regulation of transcription. For the first time, we provide direct evidence that CREMα mediates silencing of the IL2 gene in SLE T cells though histone deacetylation and CpG-DNA methylation. The downregulation             of CD43 mRNA is caused by p53-dependent transrepression, at least in part, via             a histone deacetylation mechanism. DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical processes that control gene expression. Acetylation of histones is generally associated with open and transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the activity of HDACs leads to histone deacetylation, condensation of chromatin, and inhibition of transcription. This study demonstrates that a mutual cross-talk mechanism exists between histone chaperones and histone deacetylation in transcriptional regulation. FVE is a homologue of the mammalian retinoblastoma-associated protein (RbAp), one component of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex involved in transcriptional repression, and has been shown to be involved in the deacetylation of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) chromatin encoding for a repressor of flowering. Thus, our data illustrate the orchestration of a sequential epigenetic mechanism including the histone deacetylation and methylation, and the DNA methylation processes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) mediate histone deacetylation and act in concert with histone acetyltransferases to regulate dynamic and reversible histone acetylation which modifies chromatin structure and function, affects gene transcription, thus, controlling multiple cellular processes. We hypothesized that the episomal nature of IDLVs turns them into preferential targets for epigenetic silencing involving chromatin-remodeling histone deacetylation. Silencing involves epigenetic mechanisms, including histone deacetylation. Jmjd3 transcription is not induced in Atf4-knock-out cells, but the AAR-dependent activation was rescued by inhibition of histone deacetylation with trichostatin A (TSA). We conclude that histone deacetylation is specifically required for the earliest events in appendage regeneration in amphibians, and suggest that this may act as a switch to trigger re-expression of developmental genes. Inhibition of DNA methylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza) and histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in upregulation of EP2 mRNA in all cell lines with varying influences of each epigenetic process observed. During cancer development, tumor suppressor genes were silenced by promoter methylation or histone deacetylation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important to maintain histone deacetylation. Suppression of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation normalized Pomc expression and functional abnormalities.	['Histone deacetylation, catalyzed by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, is an epigenetic modification. Histone deacetylation leads to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally repressive chromatin structure which inhibits gene transcription. ']
5a9d7caa1d1251d03b00001e	What is Alzheimers disease resilience?	Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 and Clusterin (CLU) C alleles are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and episodic memory (EM) decline. Memory resilience occurs when genetically at-risk adults perform at high and sustained levels. some 30 to 50% of older individuals who harbor AD pathology do not become symptomatic in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia.  Participants with normal cognition (n = 297) and mild cognitive impairment (n = 432) were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Resilience metrics were defined at baseline by examining the residuals when regressing brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume and cognition) on CSF biomarkers. A positive residual reflected better outcomes than expected for a given level of pathology (high resilience). Residuals were integrated into a latent variable model of resilience and validated by testing their ability to independently predict diagnostic conversion, cognitive decline, and the rate of ventricular dilation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common form of dementia in elder populations with approximately 30 million cases worldwide. Genome wide genotyping and sequencing studies have identified many genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). While most of these variants are associated with increased risk of developing LOAD, only limited number of reports focused on variants that are protective against the disease.

51753a948ed59a060a000029	What is the role of AMPK in diabetic cardiomyopathy?	We recently reported that diabetes depresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, inhibits MAPK8/JNK1-BCL2 signaling Activation of AMPK directly phosphorylates MAPK8, which mediates BCL2 phosphorylation and subsequent BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, leading to restoration of cardiac autophagy, protection against cardiac apoptosis, and ultimately improvement in cardiac structure and function. studies were shown that p38 MAPK stimulates glucose uptake through the AMPK activation. Taken together, it is suggested that the modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart. Genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. Oxidative stress and lipid deposition were markedly increased in the myocardium, concomitant with inactivation of AMPK and increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Trimetazidine also caused AMPK activation and reduced PGC-1 alpha expression in the hearts of db/db mice. The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. Activation of AMPK and decreased expression of PGC-1 alpha were involved in this process. Our findings highlight a role of PP2C and AMPK in the derangements of cardiac lipid metabolism in obesity and provide new insights as to the mechanisms of the liporegulatory disorder leading to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that dissociation of BCL2 from BECN1 through activation of MAPK8-BCL2 signaling may be an important mechanism by which AMPK activation restores autophagy, protects against cardiac apoptosis, and prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both the AMPK activator resveratrol and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine mimicked the UCF-101-induced beneficial effect in STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyocytes. UCF-101 protects against STZ-induced cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, possibly via an AMPK-associated mechanism.	['AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart.  Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin or trimetazidine administration may represent a novel approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.']

XDG activity is attributable to MUG xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity in E. coli The wild type MUG possesses more robust activity against xanthine than uracil and is active against all xanthine-containing DNA The gene for the mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) was identified in the Escherichia coli genome as a sequence homolog of the human thymine DNA glycosylase with activity against mismatched uracil base pairs. The bacterial mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) and eukaryotic thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes form a homologous family of DNA glycosylases that initiate base-excision repair of G:U/T mismatches. the principal role of Mug in E. coli may be to help repair damage to DNA caused by exogenous chemical agents such as chloroacetaldehyde excise epsilonC. The latter activity is missing in extracts from mug cells, suggesting that Mug may be the only enzyme in E. coli that can remove this mutagenic adduct.  Base-excision of a self-complementary oligonucleotide with central G:T mismatches by the G:T/U-specific mismatch DNA glycosylase (MUG) Mug does not repair U.G or T.G mismatches in vivo. remove 3,N(4)-ethenocytosine (epsilonC) from epsilonC.G mismatches The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U.G mismatches The structure of this complex explains the preference for G:U over G:T mispairs, and reveals an essentially non-specific pyrimidine-binding pocket that allows MUG/TDG enzymes to excise the alkylated base, 3, N(4)-ethenocytosine. One member of the uracil-DNA glycosylase family of repair enzymes, Escherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (Mug), is reported to distinguish U:G mispairs from U:A base pairs based upon specific contacts with the mispaired guanine after flipping the target uracil out of the duplex. T transition in the ung mug double mutant as compared to the single ung mutant suggest that MUG may be a back-up repair enzyme to the classic uracil-DNA glycosylase. The human thymine-DNA glycosylase has a sequence homolog in Escherichia coli that is described to excise uracils from U.G mismatches (Gallinari, P., and Jiricny, J. (1996) Nature 383, 735-738) and is named mismatched uracil glycosylase (Mug). Because uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) and Vsr are known to repair U.G and T.G mismatches, respectively, we conclude that Mug does not repair U.G or T.G mismatches in vivo. Mismatch uracil DNA glycosylase (Mug) from Escherichia coli is an initiating enzyme in the base-excision repair pathway.

The crystal structure of the Mug repair complex points to a preference of Mug for G:U over G:T mispairs. Nonetheless, Mug does not repair U:G or T:G mismatches in vivo. Mug possesses xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity in E.coli. The repair activity of Mug is more robust against xanthine than uracil. Furthermore, Mug excises the alkylated base, 3, N(4)-ethenocytosine (epsilonC) from epsilonC:G mismatches, and may be the only enzyme in E.coli that can remove this mutagenic adduct.

52fa74252059c6d71c00005b	Why are insulators necessary in gene therapy vectors?	hromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2 motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the "core", which provide enhancer blocking activity and reduce position effects. An attractive solution to the problem of oncogene activation is the inclusion of insulators/enhancer-blockers in the viral vectors. We propose the incorporation of chromatin insulators in the design of gene therapy vectors to overcome the problem of position effects. Chromatin insulators are protein-binding DNA elements that lack intrinsic promoter/enhancer activity but shelter genes from transcriptional influence of surrounding chromatin. The design and incorporation of effective chromatin insulator sequences in the next generation of gene therapy vectors should lead to improved and more predictable expression of therapeutic transgenes and constitute an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.	['a) They inhibit oncogene activation upon vector integration and b) They maximize the probability of vector expression upon integration in heterochromatinic regions', 'The presence of insulators in gene therapy vectors is necessary because these elements have the ability to help overcome the problem of position effects, caused due to random integration of the therapeutic genes in the host cell genome.']
554403395beec11c10000001	Which is the primary distinction between the Reverse Warburg effect and the conventional Warburg effect?	The metabolic energy transduction pathways are strongly affected in cancers. Mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells (Warburg effect) or in fibroblasts associated with cancer cells (reverse Warburg effect) results in decreased or increased power of the generated electromagnetic field, respectively cigarette smoke induces catabolism in the local microenvironment, directly fueling oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in neighboring epithelial cancer cells, actively promoting anabolic tumor growth. our current findings are consistent with the idea that cigarette smoke induces the "reverse Warburg effect," thereby fueling "two-compartment tumor metabolism" and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in epithelial cancer cells. We have recently proposed a new two-compartment model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism. In this model, glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate and ketone bodies) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells, driving OXPHOS and mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells. Consistent with the "reverse Warburg effect," our results indicate that metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) and that adjacent stromal cells are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. "glycolytic" cancer cells were rarely observed, indicating that the conventional "Warburg effect" does not frequently occur in cancer-positive lymph node metastases. We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling tumor growth and metastasis. In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. This, in turn, drives L-lactate secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) in epithelial cancer cells, by acting as a paracrine onco-metabolite. We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the "Reverse Warburg Effect," as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cancer cells. the "Reverse Warburg Effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer We have previously demonstrated that enhanced aerobic glycolysis and/or autophagy in the tumor stroma supports epithelial cancer cell growth and aggressive behavior, via the secretion of high-energy metabolites. These nutrients include lactate and ketones, as well as chemical building blocks, such as amino acids (glutamine) and nucleotides. Lactate and ketones serve as fuel for cancer cell oxidative metabolism, and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. We have termed these novel concepts the "Reverse Warburg Effect," and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism. Previously, we proposed that cancer cells behave as metabolic parasites, as they use targeted oxidative stress as a "weapon" to extract recycled nutrients from adjacent stromal cells. Oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts triggers autophagy and  mitophagy, resulting in compartmentalized cellular catabolism, loss of mitochondrial function, and the onset of aerobic glycolysis, in the tumor stroma. As such, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce high-energy nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) that fuel mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism in cancer cells. We have termed this new energy-transfer mechanism the "reverse Warburg effect." Recently, we proposed a new mechanism for understanding the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism. In this new paradigm, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, and extrude lactate to "feed" adjacent cancer cells, which then drives mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Thus, there is vectorial transport of energy-rich substrates from the fibroblastic tumor stroma to anabolic cancer cells.  the "reverse Warburg effect," which states that cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate, which is utilized as a metabolic substrate by adjacent cancer cells. In this model, "energy transfer" or "metabolic-coupling" between the tumor stroma and epithelial cancer cells "fuels" tumor growth and metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in anabolic cancer cells. the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria.  stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism", or the "Reverse Warburg Effect". Our findings are consistent with the recently proposed "Reverse Warburg Effect" and the "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism." In these two complementary models, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in adjacent stromal cells, which then forces these stromal fibroblasts to undergo autophagy/mitophagy and aerobic glycolysis. This, in turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones and glutamine) to feed anabolic cancer cells, which are undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis and the resulting energy-rich metabolites are then transferred to epithelial cancer cells, where they enter the TCA cycle, resulting in high ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. We have termed this new paradigm "The Reverse Warburg Effect." Previously, we proposed a new model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this model, the stromal fibroblasts would undergo aerobic glycolysis (a.k.a., the Warburg effect)--producing and secreting increased pyruvate/lactate that could then be used by adjacent epithelial cancer cells as "fuel" for the mitochondrial TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. In this alternative model of tumorigenesis, the epithelial cancer cells instruct the normal stroma to transform into a wound-healing stroma, providing the necessary energy-rich micro-environment for facilitating tumor growth and angiogenesis. In essence, the fibroblastic tumor stroma would directly feed the epithelial cancer cells, in a type of host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new idea the "Reverse Warburg Effect." In this scenario, the epithelial tumor cells "corrupt" the normal stroma, turning it into a factory for the production of energy-rich metabolites. Warburg's original observation that tumors show a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. The reverse Warburg effect: aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts and the tumor stroma. We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells. Thus, we conclude that ketones and lactate fuel tumor growth and metastasis, providing functional evidence to support the "Reverse Warburg Effect". We have termed this new cancer paradigm the "reverse Warburg effect," because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than tumor cells	['The conventional "Warburg effect" reffers to  the metabolic shift of cancer cells towards aerobic glycolysis, due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The "reverse Warburg effect" or "parasitic" energy-transfer, is a model of "two-compartment tumor metabolism". In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. The cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. These glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketone bodies and chemical building blocks, such as amino acids -glutamine-, and nucleotides) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells. Lactate and ketones drive cancer cell  oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Therefore, according to the "reverse Warburg effect", stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. Thus, in "reverse Warburg effect" the cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than epithelial cancer cells themselves, as proposed by the conventional "Warburg effect".']

5c6ffee17c78d6947100005a	What is the aim of the METABRIC project?	the METABRIC breast cancer data recorded for over 2000 patients Predicting Outcomes of Hormone and Chemotherapy in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) Study by Biochemically-inspired Machine Learning. Genomic aberrations and gene expression-defined subtypes in the large METABRIC patient cohort have been used to stratify and predict survival. Iteratively refining breast cancer intrinsic subtypes in the METABRIC dataset. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset Associations between genomic stratification of breast cancer and centrally reviewed tumour pathology in the METABRIC cohort. The integration of genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 2000 breast tumours from the METABRIC [Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium] cohort revealed ten subtypes, termed integrative clusters (IntClust/s), characterised by distinct genomic drivers.  RESULTS We show how this integration can be achieved automatically, following the declaration of appropriate metadata elements for each clinical data set; we demonstrate the practicality of this approach through application to experimental results and clinical data from five hospitals in the UK and Canada, undertaken as part of the METABRIC project (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium). We apply and evaluate the approach by integrating the five different clinical datasets of METABRIC. We had adopted a similar approach, termed 'BADGER', in the METABRIC project. METABRIC is a large breast cancer study that may have been the first in which eQTL-based detection of mismatches was used during the study, rather than after the event, to aid quality assurance. We conducted a cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analysis using normal or tumor breast transcriptome data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identified a total of 101 genes for 51 lead variants after combing the results of a meta-analysis of METABRIC and TCGA, and the results from GTEx at a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted p < 0.05. In UBC-TAM, NF1 frame-shift nonsense (FS/NS) mutations were also a poor outcome driver that was validated in METABRIC. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1·50, 95% CI 1·18-1·92, p=0·00010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1·68, 1·40-2·01, p<0·0001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1·68, 1·32-2·12, p<0·0001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1·62, 95% CI 1·03-2·53, p=0·036; METABRIC: 1·27, 1·02-1·58, p=0·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2·34, 1·24-4·42, p=0·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1·73, 1·23-2·46, p=0·0020). The new subtypes show accurate distributions of current clinical markers ER, PR and HER2, and survival curves in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets. The KMPlotter online tool, METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets were used to associate gene signatures with clinical outcome. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset. METHODS The EarlyR prognostic score was developed using integrative analysis of microarray data sets and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-based quantitative real-time PCR assay and validated in Affymetrix data sets and METABRIC cohort using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Classification of the personalized landscapes derived from 997 tumour samples within the Metabric discovery dataset reveals a novel poor prognosis cluster, reproducible in the 995-sample validation dataset. To explore the contribution of cellular metabolism to cancer heterogeneity, we analyse the Metabric dataset, a landmark genomic and transcriptomic study of 2,000 individual breast tumours, in the context of the human genome-scale metabolic network. We assessed the RBsig prognostic role in the METABRIC and in a comprehensive breast cancer meta-dataset. We obtained information regarding TP53 mutation and PAM50 subtypes in 699 tumors from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort. METHODS We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). Using data from both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), we showed that rs62331150 was associated with level of expression of TET2 in breast normal and tumor tissue. Large research consortia such as the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genomics Consortium are systematically interrogating large sets of tumor samples through integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number and promoter methylation, transcriptome-wide RNA expression, protein expression and exome-wide sequencing. A recent METABRIC study explored the effects of cis-acting and trans-acting factors of gene expression regulation in breast cancer. Independent validation of prognostic interactions was achieved using data from the METABRIC study.

DNA methylation is important for gene silencing and imprinting in both plants and animals. Recent advances in bisulfite sequencing allow detection of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) achieving high sensitivity, but accurately identifying heterozygous SNVs from partially C-to-T converted sequences remains challenging.Results: We designed two methods, BayesWC and BinomWC, that substantially improved the precision of heterozygous SNV calls from ∼80% to 99% while retaining comparable recalls. With these SNV calls, we provided functions for allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) analysis and visualizing the methylation status on reads. Applying ASM analysis to a previous dataset, we found that an average of 1.5% of investigated regions showed allelic methylation, which were significantly enriched in transposon elements and likely to be shared by the same cell-type. A dynamic fragment strategy was utilized for DMR analysis in low-coverage data and was able to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) related to key genes involved in tumorigenesis using a public cancer dataset.

5d387e74a1e1595105000012	How is the mouse Fxy gene evolving?	We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations.   Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique. Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms. This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content. These results strongly suggest that recombination is the primary determinant of the isochore organization of mammalian genomes. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gen	[" Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique.", "The rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique."]

5a75eb6483b0d9ea66000004	What is Blount's disease?	Guided growth for tibia vara (Blount's disease). Blount's disease is commonly attributed to an intrinsic, idiopathic defect in the posteromedial proximal tibial physis resulting in progressive bowing of the leg, intoeing, and lateral knee thrust. Blount's disease is an uncommon disorder of postero-medial proximal tibial physis. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis.  Infantile Blount's disease is a condition that causes genu varum and internal tibial torsion. Blount's disease, or tibia vara, is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents.  In an attempt to improve the post-operative outcomes and reduce known neurologic complications, we used discrete multimodality recording and stimulation models to identify areas of motor and sensory function in eighteen (18) pediatric patients presenting with Tibia Vara (Blount's Disease).  Late-onset tibia vara or Blount's disease is the most common cause of pathologic genu varum in children and adolescents. PURPOSE: Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy is a useful option for correcting deformity associated with Blount's disease (tibia vara). INTRODUCTION: In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease. BACKGROUND: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities.  In 1937 Blount described a series of 28 patients with 'Tibia vara'. Since then, a number of deformities in the tibia and the femur have been described in association with this condition.  A LSG was done in a 10-year-old boy, body mass index (BMI) 42, who has Blount's disease (tibia vara) with severe pain at the knee joints that made him a wheelchair-bound person.  A review of the English literature on Blount disease (osteochondrosis deformans tibiae; tibia vara) revealed that two forms of the disease, infantile and adolescent, are recognized. <b>BACKGROUND</b>: Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount disease can be defined as idiopathic proximal tibial vara. BACKGROUND Blount's disease is a multi-planar deformity affecting the pediatric population which leads to varus alignment of the lower extremities. Blount's disease or congenital tibia vara is a clinical entity characterized by tibia bowing, tibia torsion, and beaking of the medial tibia metaphysis on plain radiograph. In view of the spontaneous recovery of all investigated patients, it must be doubted whether a diagnosis of infantile tibia vara can be made in early infancy, and whether infantile Blount's disease is a diagnosis in its own right. Blount's disease is a progressive form of genu varum due to asymmetrical inhibition of the postero medial portion of the proximal tibial epiphysis. INTRODUCTION In stage 1 of all currently accepted classifications for infantile tibia vara, the diagnosis is difficult between physiological bowing and true Blount's disease.

The selling and importing of puffer fish species and their products was banned in Thailand in 2002, because of possible neurotoxic effects. Efficiency of a rapid test for detection of tetrodotoxin in puffer fish. Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin Tetrodotoxin is a potent low weight marine toxin found in warm waters, especially of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Intoxications are usually linked to the consumption of the puffer fish, although TTX was already detected in several different edible taxa. Food poisoning due to ingestion of a puffer fish occurred in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, in October 2008, causing neurotoxic symptoms similar to those of tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning.  Our findings raised a concern for people, not only Thais but also inhabitants of other countries situated on the Andaman coast; consuming puffers of the Andaman seas is risky due to potential TTX intoxication. Toxic marine puffer fish in Thailand seas and tetrodotoxin they contained. Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative, non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to produce tetrodotoxin (TTX) Isolation and identification of a new tetrodotoxin-producing bacterial species, Raoultella terrigena, from Hong Kong marine puffer fish Takifugu niphobles. Green toadfish Lagocephalus lunaris inhabits tropical and subtropical seas and contains high tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in the muscle as well as liver and gonad Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly potent neurotoxin that blocks the action potential by selectively binding to voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)) Suspected tetrodotoxin (TTX) poisoning was associated with eating unknown fish in April 2009 in Taiwan Marine pufferfish generally contain a large amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in their skin and viscera, and have caused many incidences of food poisoning, especially in Japan.  TTX is originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria.  , TTX poisoning due to marine snails has recently spread through Japan, China, Taiwan, and Europe. The inhibitory effects of toxin extracted from muscle or liver of five different puffer fishes (hereafter referred as puffer(s)) captured on the Japanese sea coast  LC/MS analysis of tetrodotoxin and its deoxy analogs in the marine puffer fish Fugu niphobles from the southern coast of Korea, and in the brackishwater puffer fishes Tetraodon nigroviridis and Tetraodon biocellatus from Southeast Asia. Toxins such as saxitoxins, tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, may be produced in large amounts by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and accumulate in vectors that transfer the toxin along food chains Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish.

5539062dbc4f83e828000013	What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?	Through targeted re-sequencing, we identified mutations of MLL2 in 8 % (14/175) of MBs, the majority of which were loss of function. Notably, we also report mutations affecting the MLL2-binding partner KDM6A, in 4 % (7/175) of tumors. While MLL2 mutations were independent of age, gender, histological subtype, M-stage or molecular subgroup, KDM6A mutations were most commonly identified in Group 4 MBs, and were mutually exclusive with MLL2 mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the chromatin effectors of MLL2 and KDM6A activity, respectively, demonstrated alterations of the histone code in 24 % (53/220) of MBs across all subgroups. Correlating these MLL2- and KDM6A-driven histone marks with prognosis, we identified populations of MB with improved (K4+/K27-) and dismal (K4-/K27-) outcomes, observed primarily within Group 3 and 4 MBs we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Aberrant patterns of H3K4 and H3K27 histone lysine methylation occur across subgroups in medulloblastoma. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, suggest that defective control of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors.	['Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.']

5c58a0e486df2b917400000c	What is the mechanism of action of Ivosidenib?	 Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Discovery of AG-120 (Ivosidenib): A First-in-Class Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of IDH1 Mutant Cancers. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. A phase I study suggests that ivosidenib can induce remission in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia characterized by IDH1 mutations.   Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1.METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in IDH1-mutated AML. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML, ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with complete remission.  Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120).  The FDA approved ivosidenib for patients with IDH1-mutant relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

5a6fa417b750ff445500005f	Describe the RNA Centric Annotation System (RCAS)	Here, we present the RNA Centric Annotation System (RCAS), an R package, which is designed to ease the process of creating gene-centric annotations and analysis for the genomic regions of interest obtained from various RNA-based omics technologies. The design of RCAS is modular, which enables flexible usage and convenient integration with other bioinformatics workflows. RCAS is an R/Bioconductor package but we also created graphical user interfaces including a Galaxy wrapper and a stand-alone web service. The application of RCAS on published datasets shows that RCAS is not only able to reproduce published findings but also helps generate novel knowledge and hypotheses. The meta-gene profiles, gene-centric annotation, motif analysis and gene-set analysis provided by RCAS provide contextual knowledge which is necessary for understanding the functional aspects of different biological events that involve RNAs. In addition, the array of different interfaces and deployment options adds the convenience of use for different levels of users.
