5e31cb85fbd6abf43b00004e	What gene is mutated in Huntington's Disease patients?	Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant neurodegenerative disease caused by a dominantly inherited CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the HD disease protein, huntingtin (HTT). PolyQ expansion promotes misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT (mHTT) within neurons. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Two decades ago, researchers identified that a CAG expansion mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene was involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, since the identification of the HTT gene, there has been no advance in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or reduce the progression of HD Mutations in the HTT gene , consisting of expansion of CAG triplets , cause the Huntington 's disease ( HD) , one of the major neurodegenerative disorders .  Huntington 's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that is caused by the mutation of the gene which produces a protein called huntingtin ( htt) .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system ( CNS ) that is defined by a CAG expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene leading to the production of mutant huntingtin ( mHtt) .  A mutation in the huntingtin ( Htt ) gene produces mutant Htt and Huntington 's disease ( HD) , a neurodegenerative disorder .  Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in patients with a mutation in the huntingtin or IT15 gene.  Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expanded stretch of consecutive trinucleotides (cytosine-adenosine-guanine, CAG) within the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4 (p16.3). Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by high instability and extension of CAG sequences within the coding region of IT15 gene. Huntington's disorder (HD), caused by mutations of the IT-15 gene, is an autosomal genetic disease that causes the breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. Positional cloning has shown that the Huntington disease (HD) mutation is an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene.	['HTT gene encoding the protein huntingtin']
5e48efd9f8b2df0d49000004	What is the aim of the "Radiogenomics Consortium"?	An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics. A major aim of research in radiogenomics is the development of a predictive instrument to enable identification of people who are at greatest risk for adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment using radiation. Optimal design and patient selection for interventional trials using radiogenomic biomarkers Nearly 50% of cancer patients undergo radiotherapy. Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients.

5a6900ebb750ff445500001d	Which disease is diagnosed using the Finkelstein's test?	The inclusion criteria were positive Finkelstein's test and no response to non-surgical treatment for 6 weeks. Forty-eight patients with de Quervain's disease who did not respond to conservative treatment were operated with two different incisions. De Quervain's disease has different clinical features. Different tests have been described in the past, the most popular test being the Eichhoff's test, often wrongly named as the Finkelstein's test. Furthermore, we found that Finkelstein's test can give a false positive result. Therefore, ultrasound should not only be considered to improve the treatment outcome, but can also be useful as a diagnostic tool in the management of de Quervain's disease. The Finkelstein's test was positive in all cases.  A successful outcome was achieved in all cases with negative Finkelstein's test. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment. Finkelstein's test is pathognomonic. PURPOSE: Finkelstein's test is the classic diagnostic test for de Quervain's disease.  [Finkelstein's versus Brunelli's test in De Quervain tenosynovitis].

5e36d5b9b5b409ea53000009	Which algorithm has been developed for detecting expansions of tandem repeats?	Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that , using PCR-free WGS short-read data , can genotype repeats at the locus of interest , even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length	['ExpansionHunter']

56ed14d92ac5ed145900000a	What is the genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis?	The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors Ten years ago, a mutation in the TSC2 gene was identified in the Eker rat at Fox Chase Cancer Center by Yeung and Knudson, and in Tokyo by Kobayashi and Hino. Here, we will review the clinical association of RCC in TSC, consider the factors that have led to its under-emphasis within the RCC field, address the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to RCC in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and finally discuss the ways in which the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to sporadic RCC in the general population. Either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, can be mutated, resulting in the tuberous sclerosis complex phenotype. The protein products of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), have been discovered to play important roles in several cell-signaling pathways Knowledge regarding the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex has led to therapeutic intervention trials.  TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease. We previously found TSC2 loss of heterozygosity in 7 of 13 (54%) of angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients, suggesting that LAM and TSC could have a common genetic basis. Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex gene TSC2 are a cause of sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis The disease can be caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC2, identified in 1993, and TSC1, only recently identified. Molecular genetic basis of renal carcinogenesis in the Eker rat model of tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2) We have recently identified on rat chromosome 10q a germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis gene (Tsc2), the gene predisposing to renal carcinoma (RC) in the Eker rat Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene that can result in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organ systems Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway.  In all these lesions, genetic alterations related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have been demonstrated.

56ffd08bcf1c325851000009	From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from?	The origin of Alu-derived minisatellites appears to have been mediated by short flanking repeats, as first proposed by Haber and Louis Finally, we propose that the origin of Alu subfamilies in human populations may be related to evolution of chromosome Y. Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element Alu elements are each a dimer of similar, but not identical, fragments of total size about 300 bp, and originate from the 7SL RNA gene.

530cefaaad0bf1360c00000d	Which hormone abnormalities are common in Williams syndrome ?	WS and TD participants had similar profiles in a familiar setting, while participants with WS had elevated cortisol late in the day in the novel setting when social demands were higher. The cortisol awakening response in WS was associated with parent-reported levels of somatic complaints and social difficulties. Results suggest that adults with WS have a typical diurnal cortisol profile that may be sensitive to social and activity transitions throughout the day. Results revealed significantly higher median levels of OT in WS versus controls at baseline, with a less marked increase in AVP. Further, in WS, OT and AVP increased in response to music and to cold, with greater variability and an amplified peak release compared to controls. In WS, baseline OT but not AVP, was correlated positively with approach, but negatively with adaptive social behaviors. These results indicate that WS deleted genes perturb hypothalamic-pituitary release not only of OT but also of AVP, implicating more complex neuropeptide circuitry for WS features and providing evidence for their roles in endogenous regulation of human social behavior.  Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects.  Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized by cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended.  In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation.  Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life. As growth hormone (GH) deficiency was diagnosed by an additional GH-stimulation test, we commenced with a GH-treatment.  None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism.  Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well.  Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). A WS patient with CPP is presented, whose pubertal development and bone age progression were arrested by administration of GnRH analogues.   This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. We report a female infant with confirmed WBS who, through provocative testing, was found to have GHD and who responded satisfactorily to hGH therapy.  In conclusion, GH deficiency might contribute to the growth failure in a number of patients with WBS and in such cases hGH therapy will most likely improve final height. Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent.  Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS.  Thyroid hemiagenesis and elevated thyrotropin levels in a child with Williams syndrome. A girl with Williams syndrome (WS) presented with elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels (7.0 microU/ml), normal free thyroid hormone concentrations, and absent antithyroid autoantibodies. TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) injection (200 microg/mq, i.v.) was exaggerated and prolonged, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. The biological activity of circulating TSH was slightly below the normal range [TSH bioactivity (B) to immunoreactivity (I) ratio (TSH B/I) = 0.4, normal: 0.6-2.2]. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with hypothalamic hypothyroidism. However, abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and thyroid dysgenesis have been found in other WS cases.  We report a boy with confirmed Williams-Beuren syndrome, who was found to have classical growth hormone deficiency and responded well to growth hormone therapy.  Although growth hormone deficiency is not likely to be a common cause of short stature in Williams-Beuren syndrome, we nevertheless recommend evaluation of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis in all cases. Endocrinological examinations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Prolonged and exaggerated responses of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) were also noted.  Involvement of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in Williams syndrome is postulated on the basis that Williams syndrome children often have infantile hypercalcemia and deficient expression of calcitonin, a hormone that lowers serum calcium levels.  These findings suggest that the calcitonin deficiency might be due either to mutations elsewhere in the gene or to defects in the cellular machinery needed for calcitonin synthesis and/or secretion. It has been suggested that a defect in calcitonin function may play a role in Williams syndrome.   These patients were found to have significantly higher mean baseline calcium concentrations, delayed clearance of calcium after intravenous calcium loading, and blunted calcitonin responses after calcium infusion, compared with a group of seven normal children. Our studies demonstrate that patients with Williams syndrome have a defect in the synthesis or release of immunoreactive calcitonin. A deficiency of calcitonin may explain the abnormalities of calcium metabolism seen in these patients and can serve as an important endocrine marker for Williams syndrome. Additional periodic evaluations during childhood: serum concentration of calcium, thyroid function, hearing, and renal and bladder ultrasound examination. Periodic evaluations during adulthood: glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, and arterial stenosis; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function.  Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%).	['thyroid']

5ace1a590340b9f05800000b	What percentage of Homo sapiens DNA is of Neanderthal origin?	We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Here, we present evidence of Neanderthal introgression within the chromosome 3p21.31 region, occurring with a high frequency in East Asians (ranging from 49.4% to 66.5%) and at a low frequency in Europeans. This introgression was under positive natural selection, reached a frequency of>50%, and introduced a homocysteine level- and pigmentation-associated allele (rs460879-T) into East Asians.  Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans.  This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. 	['2-4%']

5c72f5247c78d6947100007e	Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?	Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the DCAF17 gene. Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Exome sequencing revealed a novel biallelic deletion in the DCAF17 gene underlying Woodhouse Sakati syndrome. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements.  The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature.  DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Phenotypic Variability of c.436delC DCAF17 Gene Mutation in Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome.BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that was first described in 1983. Since its original description, approximately 50 cases have been reported with various clinical signs and symptoms.  CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. Despite identical genetic alteration, our 5 patients had various clinical features among them and compared with previously reported cases with the same pathogenic mutation.

52f21b722059c6d71c00000b	What is the usual HER-2 status in breast cancer associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome?	Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Recent data show that breast cancer in germline TP53 mutation carriers is commonly HER2+ (63-83 %). Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations. The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2.

58d8e6818acda3452900000a	Which gene mutations cause the Marfan syndrome?	The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome (MFS) highlight the importance of a FBN1 mutation test in diagnosing MFS.  A marked decrease in heart rate variability in Marfan syndrome patients with confirmed FBN1 mutations. The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation.  Heart rates in MS patients with the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test (p<0.001). A marked decrease in HRV, documented in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed FBN1 gene mutations. Evaluating the quality of Marfan genotype-phenotype correlations in existing FBN1 databases. Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Novel FBN1 gene mutation and maternal germinal mosaicism as the cause of neonatal form of Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1).  While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. [Screening of FBN1 gene mutations in a family with Marfan syndrome]. To identify FBN1 gene mutations in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome. Identification of fibrillin-1 gene mutations in Marfan syndrome by high-resolution melting analysis. Three diagnostic classifications comprising first, Marfan genotype with a causative FBN1 gene mutation; second, Marfan phenotype with clinical criteria of the original Ghent nosology (Ghent-1); and third, phenotype with clinical criteria of its current revision (Ghent-2) in 300 consecutive persons referred for confirmation or exclusion of Marfan syndrome (150 men, 150 women aged 35 ± 13 years) were used. Prevalence of dural ectasia in 63 gene-mutation-positive patients with features of Marfan syndrome type 1 and Loeys-Dietz syndrome and report of 22 novel FBN1 mutations.

Classic, atypically severe and neonatal Marfan syndrome: twelve mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in FBN1 exons 24-40. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype. Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) are known to cause classical Marfan's syndrome, ectopia lentis and neonatal Marfan's syndrome. Severe Marfan syndrome due to FBN1 exon deletions. BACKGROUND: Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications. It is still difficult to use modern genetic testing for diagnosis because Marfan syndrome can be caused by many different mutations in FBN1, a large gene with 65 coding segments, while mutations in other genes can cause overlapping phenotypes The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations.Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), and related connective tissue disorders Acute mitral regurgitation due to chordal rupture in a patient with neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by a deletion in exon 29 of the FBN1 gene. Neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by an exon 25 mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene.

Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system.  It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome. Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes. Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome. By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of Marfan syndrome by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the renal malformation in the patient. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD. Marfan syndrome is a multisystem disorder of connective tissue that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and results from mutation of the FBN1 gene on human chromosome 15. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system. We here report 22 novel and 9 recurrent mutations in the FBN1 gene in 36 patients with clinical features of Marfan syndrome. The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission. FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause Marfan syndrome in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the Marfan syndrome type II gene. Fifteen novel FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome detected by heteroduplex analysis of genomic amplicons. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. Mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin-1, FBN1, are known to cause Marfan syndrome, and have been identified in almost all exons of FBN1. Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population. While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, on chromosome 15q21.1, have been found to cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by clinically variable skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterised by pleiotropic manifestations involving primarily the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene causing the Marfan syndrome.

X-linked Christianson syndrome: heterozygous female Slc9a6 knockout mice develop mosaic neuropathological changes and related behavioral abnormalities. CS is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which encodes a multipass transmembrane sodium (potassium)-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) protein, functional in early recycling endosomes.  A Christianson syndrome-linked deletion mutation (∆(287)ES(288)) in SLC9A6 disrupts recycling endosomal function and elicits neurodegeneration and cell death. BACKGROUND: Christianson Syndrome, a recently identified X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by mutations in the human gene SLC9A6 encoding the recycling endosomal alkali cation/proton exchanger NHE6.  BACKGROUND: Mutations of SLC9A6 may cause an X-linked clinical syndrome first described by Christianson in 1999 in which affected males exhibited profound intellectual disability, autism, drug-resistant epilepsy, ophthalmoplegia, mild craniofacial dysmorphism, microcephaly, and ataxia. OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6).  Genetic and phenotypic diversity of NHE6 mutations in Christianson syndrome.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antinoceptive interaction between the opioid analgesic, tapentadol, and the NSAID, ketorolac, in the mouse orofacial formalin test.  experimental nociception using formalin test In vivo antinociceptive activity (formalin test)  The formalin test has been used in monkeys for assessing pain. Moreover, by using selective antagonists, the role of 5-HT1B/1D serotonergic receptors was investigated in the antinociception induced by these antimigraine drugs.The formalin test was used to assess the nociceptive activity. In this study, we examined the effect of systemic morphine on Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) evoked in the formalin test, a widely used model of persistent pain. The formalin test for nociception, predominantly used with rodents, is characterized by continuous pain due to tissue injury induced by formalin. The orofacial formalin test can then be considered as a reliable way of producing and quantifying nociception in the trigeminal region of the rat.<br> The formalin test is used as a primary behavioural screen for assaying the antinociceptive activity of compounds in laboratory rodents. The formalin test is the most accepted chemical test for evaluation of nociception. Nociceptive responses were measured by formalin test (50µl injection of formalin 2% subcutaneously into hind paw) and pain related behaviors were monitored for 90 min. Formalin injection induces nociceptive bahaviour in phase I and II, with a quiescent phase between them.  The rat paw formalin test is a model of prolonged pain due to mild tissue injury.  The formalin test is increasingly applied as a model of inflammatory pain using high formalin concentrations (5-15%).  Although the formalin test is a widely used model of persistent pain formalin tests were used for the study of pain While the formalin test is a widely used behavioral model of tonic chemogenic pain, The formalin test, which is based on these observations, is now widely used as a model of pain produced by tissue injury, 	['pain modeling']

53147b52e3eabad021000015	What is a benefit of being g6PD-deficient?	A central position of the PPP for malaria parasites is supported by the fact that human G6PD deficiency protects to a certain degree from malaria infections.  The beneficial effect of thalassemia minor, sickle-cell trait, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on survival of malaria infection may well be due to the shared feature of enhanced oxidative stress. This may inhibit parasite growth, enhance uptake of infected RBCs by spleen macrophages, and/or cause less cytoadherence of the infected cells to capillary endothelium.  In conclusion, genetic variants that confer resistance to malaria are associated with RBC traits in African-Americans.  G6PD deficiency has been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity. G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P. vivax predominates. Severe G6PDd was associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions. and G6PD (Xq28)-were associated (P ≤ 1 × 10(-6)) with RBC traits in the discovery cohort	['There is evidence of increased resistance to malaria.']
58bca08702b8c6095300000a	What is Dravet syndrome?	Dravet syndrome is one of the most severe epilepsy syndromes of early childhood, and it comes with very high morbidity and mortality. The typical presentation is characterized by hemiclonic or generalized clonic seizures triggered by fever during the first year of life, followed by myoclonic, absence, focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Dravet syndrome, a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome, is typically resistant to anti-epileptic drugs (AED). Dravet syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome of infantile onset, frequently caused by SCN1A mutations or deletions. Dravet syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple types of seizures. Haploinsufficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 causes Dravet syndrome, an intractable childhood-onset epilepsy with hyperactivity, cognitive deficit, autistic-like behaviours, and premature death Thus, the multi-faceted phenotypes of Dravet syndrome can be genetically dissected, revealing synergy in causing epilepsy, premature death and deficits in long-term spatial memory, but interneuron-specific effects on hyperactivity and autistic-like behaviours Dravet syndrome, or as it was called in the past severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is a drug-resistant epilepsy first described by Charlotte Dravet in 1978 Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, refractory form of epilepsy, for whose treatment stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed for add-on use.To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments (including ketogenic diet) as therapy for patients with SMEI.We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (15 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4 of 12, The Cochrane Library, April 2013), MEDLINE (1 Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha-1 subunit gene SCN1A. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy largely refractory to current antiepileptic medications.  Dravet syndrome is a rare epileptic encephalopathy characterized by treatment-resistant polymorphic seizures.  Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset epileptic seizures followed by ataxia and cognitive decline. Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy.  Dravet syndrome or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) is a baleful epileptic encephalopathy that begins in the first year of life.  Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types, developmental slowing and poor outcome Dravet syndrome is an intractable epileptic syndrome beginning in the first year of life. Dravet syndrome is an epileptic syndrome of infancy and early childhood.

5d35dfbdb3a638076300000b	What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?	STAG2 and Rad21 mammalian mitotic cohesins are implicated in meiosis.  Two members of this family, STAG1/SA1 and STAG2/SA2,double dagger are classified as mitotic cohesins, as they are found in human somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis as components of the cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) complexes, in which the shared subunits are Rad21/SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 proteins. Identification of STAG1 as a key mediator of a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. The STAG1 gene was one of the transcripts showing higher expression levels in cells infected with Ad-p53-121F as opposed to Ad-wtp53.  the expression of STAG1 mRNA was induced in response to various genotoxic stresses in a p53-dependent manner; moreover, enforced expression of STAG1 led to apoptosis in several additional cancer cell lines. Differential regulation of telomere and centromere cohesion by the Scc3 homologues SA1 and SA2, respectively, in human cells. Here, we show that cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) are differentially required for telomere and centromere cohesion, respectively. These results suggest that at telomeres cohesion relies on the molecular interplay between TRF1 and SA1 to promote DNA-DNA pairing, while along chromosomal arms the core cohesin assembly might also depend on SA1 1D diffusion on DNA and sequence-specific DNA binding.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer cells on its paralog STAG1 In all cases, we observed that the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.  cohesin-SA1 preferentially contributes to the stabilization of topologically associating domain boundaries together with CTCF, whereas cohesin-SA2 promotes cell-type-specific contacts between enhancers and promoters independently of CTCF. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association. A striking finding was the identification of members of the cohesin complex (STAG2, RAD21, STAG1, and SMC3) among the top 20 genes from the screen. Upon individual validation of these cohesin genes, we found that their knockdown led to an immediate expansion of cells with an HSC phenotype in vitro.	['meiosis and cell proliferation']

58eb4ce7eda5a57672000004	Which cellular function is associated with transcription factors forkhead 1 and 2 (Fkh1 and Fkh2)?	Forkhead transcription factors establish origin timing and long-range clustering in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. A key function in this process involves the regulation of the cell cycle and stress responses including free radical scavenging. We report that the deletion of both FKH genes impedes normal lifespan and stress resistance, particularly in stationary phase cells, which are non-responsive to caloric restriction. Conversely, increased expression of the FKHs leads to extended lifespan and improved stress response. This study establishes the FKHs role as evolutionarily conserved regulators of lifespan in yeast and identifies the APC as a novel component of this mechanism under certain conditions, likely through combined regulation of stress response, genomic stability, and cell cycle regulation. The genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has four genes that code for proteins containing fork-head domains (FKH), two of which have been characterised. Here we describe the remaining two genes, fhl1 and fkh2, that code for proteins containing fork-head-associated domains (FHA) besides their FKHs. Here we show that the yeast forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1p and Fkh2p, associate with the coding regions of active genes and influence, in opposing ways, transcriptional elongation and termination. Our results suggest that, in addition to their documented promoter function, Fkh1p and Fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation and pre-mRNA processing. This may reflect a general feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Forkhead Box (FOX) proteins, Fkh1 and Fkh2, regulate diverse cellular processes including transcription, long-range DNA interactions during homologous recombination, and replication origin timing and long-range origin clustering.

5ad83cd6133db5eb78000010	Which species is the carrier of the SFTS ( severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome) virus?	Seroprevalence in animal species were: goats (66.8%), cattle (28.2%), dogs (7.4%), pigs (4.7%), chickens (1.2%), geese (1.7%), rodents (4.4%) and hedgehogs (2.7%). The possibility that SFTSV transmission may occur by both the transstadial and transovarial routes was suggested by the fact that viral RNA was detected in H. longicornis at all developmental stages. Tick-derived sequences shared over 95.6% identity with human- and animal-derived isolates. This study provides evidence that implicates ticks as not only vectors but also, reservoirs of SFTSV. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new emerging zoonosis. A survey of reptile-associated ticks and their infection status with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus was conducted to determine the relative abundance and distribution among lizards, skinks, and snakes in the Republic of Korea (ROK). In total, 84 ixodid ticks belonging to two genera (Ixodes and Amblyomma) were collected from 28/132 (21.2%) lizards, skinks, and snakes. These results implicate lizards and snakes as potential hosts of SFTS virus. Haemophysalis longicornis ticks have been considered the vector of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV).

515dd3d5298dcd4e5100001c	In what proportion of children with heart failure has Enalapril been shown to be safe and effective?	The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year Patients with intraatrial baffle procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have diastolic dysfunction, decreased exercise capacity, stroke volume response and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed. A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function. Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure. Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure. Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery. Renal failure was a problem in young infants with left-to-right shunts. In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril. The median age was 5.4 months. All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%. Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3). Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome. The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0.30 (0.21) mg/kg/day. Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril. We studied the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in eight infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics, treated orally with 0.25 mg kg-1 enalapril maleate once a day In infants with CHF, mean baseline ACE activity was significantly higher than in control infants Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit "heart failure" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.

58da111c8acda34529000010	Which is the main cause of the Patau syndrome?	Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by a triad of cleft lip and palate, postaxial polydactyly and microcephaly. Mosaic trisomy 13 is very rare, it occurs in only 5% of all patients with trisomy 13 phenotype. Among full autosomal trisomies, only trisomies of chromosome 21 (Down syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 13 (Patau syndrome) are compatible with postnatal survival.  We describe the management of the eyelid anomaly associated with Patau syndrome. Trisomy 13 is the genotype of the syndrome's phenotype.  This article identifies the causes and manifestations of most of these trisomies: trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).  WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13. Patau syndrome is a chromosomal disorder associated with multiple malformations caused by inheritance of an extra chromosome (trisomy 13). Survival of trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) in England and Wales: 2004-2011 To determine whether older paternal age increases the risk of fathering a pregnancy with Patau (trisomy 13), Edwards (trisomy 18), Klinefelter (XXY) or XYY syndrome.Case-control: cases with each of these syndromes were matched to four controls with Down syndrome from within the same congenital anomaly register and with maternal age within 6 months.Data from 22 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registers in 12 European countries.Diagnoses with observed or (for terminations) predicted year of birth from 1980 to 2005, comprising live births, fetal deaths with gestational age ≥ 20 weeks and terminations after prenatal diagnosis of the anomaly. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in 5-10% associated with chromosomal abnormalities like, Pallister Killian syndrome, Trisomy 18, and certain deletions.. Association of CDH with trisomy 13 (Patau syndromes) is very rare WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13.  Patau syndrome is a chromosomal disorder associated with multiple malformations caused by inheritance of an extra chromosome (trisomy 13).  Ocular abnormalities in Patau syndrome (chromosome 13 trisomy syndrome). Trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome): a rare case of survival into adulthood. BACKGROUND: Whilst maternal age is an established risk factor for Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the aetiology and contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13. Patau syndrome, trisomy 13, is the third commonest autosomal trisomy. Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) is very rare in live-born babies.	['Trisome 13']

5e52a4ec6d0a277941000044	Which R package has been developed for MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics?	Phosphonormalizer: an R package for normalization of MS-based label-free phosphoproteomics. Global centering-based normalization is a commonly used normalization approach in mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. It scales the peptide abundances to have the same median intensities, based on an assumption that the majority of abundances remain the same across the samples. However, especially in phosphoproteomics, this assumption can introduce bias, as the samples are enriched during sample preparation which can mask the underlying biological changes. To address this possible bias, phosphopeptides quantified in both enriched and non-enriched samples can be used to calculate factors that mitigate the bias.Results: We present an R package phosphonormalizer for normalizing enriched samples in label-free mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Availability and implementation: The phosphonormalizer package is freely available under GPL ( > =2) license from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/phosphonormalizer).

56c83f365795f9a73e000011	Which domain allowing self-association do exist in TDP-43 and FUS proteins?	Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules. Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. Approximately 1% of human proteins harbor a prion-like domain (PrLD) of similar low complexity sequence and amino acid composition to domains that drive prionogenesis of yeast proteins like Sup35. PrLDs are over-represented in human RNA-binding proteins and mediate phase transitions underpinning RNP granule assembly. This modality renders PrLDs prone to misfold into conformers that accrue in pathological inclusions that characterize various fatal neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TDP-43 and FUS form cytoplasmic inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS can cause ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which rank 1st and 10th among RRM-bearing prion candidates, form cytoplasmic inclusions in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients and mutations in TDP-43 and FUS cause familial ALS.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, that harbor prion-like domains, cause some forms of ALS. two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins. Mutations in related RNA-binding proteins TDP-43, FUS/TLS and TAF15 have been connected to ALS. These three proteins share several features, including the presence of a bioinformatics-predicted prion domain, aggregation-prone nature in vitro and in vivo and toxic effects when expressed in multiple model systems. Moreover, two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a 'prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins TDP-43 and FUS and several related RNA-binding proteins harbor aggregation-promoting prion-like domains that allow them to rapidly self-associate. Molecular cloning of subunit 4 of the complex revealed that it is a proteasome-COP9 complex-eIF3 domain protein encoded by a gene that maps to chromosome 5, near the chromosomal location of the cop8 and fus4 mutations.  Deletions in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 that preclude interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 abolish TDP-43-dependent rescue of CGG repeat toxicity. The rescue appears specific to TDP-43, as co-expression of another ALS-associated RNA-binding protein, FUS, exacerbates the toxic effects of CGG repeats Recently, through Next-Generation Exome sequencing approaches a mutation resulting in a substitution (p.Q290X) in the nuclear export domain of the FUS protein was nominated as a cause of autosomal dominant essential tremor (ET) in a large kindred TDP-43 is another RNA-binding protein implicated in ALS We also provide multiple independent lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence that EWSR1 has similar properties as TDP-43, FUS and TAF15, including aggregation-prone behavior in vitro and ability to confer neurodegeneration in Drosophila. For TDP-43, both the RRM1 and the C-terminal glycine-rich domain are required for SG localization. Furthermore, TDP-43 and FUS display distinct domain requirements in aggregate formation and cytotoxicity. Binding was mediated by an unstructured TDP-43 C-terminal domain and occurred within the context of a 300-400-kDa complex that also contained C-terminal cleavage products of TDP-43 linked to neuropathology. It was recently found that dominant mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding domain protein) and FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma) cause a subset of ALS.

5178d6be8ed59a060a000038	What is a popular mesaure of gene expression in RNA-seq experiments?	Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure.	['Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM)']
5c61f767e842deac67000007	Which ploidy-agnostic method has been developed for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data?	Telomerecat: A ploidy-agnostic method for estimating telomere length from whole genome sequencing data. To this end, a number of approaches for estimating telomere length from whole-genome sequencing data have been proposed. Here we present Telomerecat, a novel approach to the estimation of telomere length. Previous methods have been dependent on the number of telomeres present in a cell being known, which may be problematic when analysing aneuploid cancer data and non-human samples. Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons. We also apply the method to a cancer cell data, uncovering an interesting relationship with the underlying telomerase genotype.

Oral fexinidazole for late-stage African Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis: a pivotal multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients. AIM: Fexinidazole (FEX) is a nitroimidazole being developed as a new trypanocide treatment for human African trypanosomiasis/sleeping sickness.  We also observed that fexinidazole and fexinidazole sulfone are more effective than benznidazole and nifurtimox as curative treatments, particularly for acute stage infections, most likely as a result of the higher and more prolonged exposure of the sulfone derivative. Specifically, the authors review the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole, which is one of the few drugs which have reached Phase II trials.  New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles.  Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in treating T. cruzi in a mouse model of acute infection, with cure rates superior to those achieved with either fexinidazole itself or benznidazole. Fexinidazole treatment was also shown to reduce myocarditis in all animals infected with VL-10 or Colombian resistant T. cruzi strains, although parasite eradication was not achieved in all treated animals at the tested doses.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Fexinidazole is an effective oral treatment of acute and chronic experimental CD caused by benznidazole-susceptible, partially resistant, and resistant T. cruzi. Fexinidazole is moderately active in vitro against African trypanosomes (IC₅₀ against laboratory strains and recent clinical isolates ranged between 0.16 and 0.93 µg/mL) and oral administration of fexinidazole at doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 4 days or 200 mg/kg/day for 5 days cured mice with acute and chronic infection respectively, the latter being a model for the advanced and fatal stage of the disease when parasites have disseminated into the brain.

Antitrypanosomal activity of fexinidazole metabolites, potential new drug candidates for Chagas disease. Determination of an optimal dosing regimen for fexinidazole, a novel oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis: first-in-human studies. Here, we report that fexinidazole, a drug currently in phase 1 clinical trials for treating African trypanosomiasis, shows promise for treating visceral leishmaniasis. CONCLUSIONS Fexinidazole is an effective oral treatment of acute and chronic experimental CD caused by benznidazole-susceptible, partially resistant, and resistant T. cruzi. Fexinidazole, a 2-subsituted 5-nitroimidazole drug candidate rediscovered following extensive compound mining by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and currently in Phase I clinical study for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis, was evaluated in experimental models of acute and chronic CD caused by different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT. INTERPRETATION Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients. Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole drug currently in clinical development for the treatment of human sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis [HAT]), caused by infection with species of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. In the search for new therapeutics, the repurposing of the broad-spectrum antiprotozoal drug fexinidazole has completed Phase III trials with the anticipation that it will be the first oral treatment for HAT. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole recently included in a clinical efficacy trial as an oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Fexinidazole, a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole rediscovered by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) after extensive compound mining of public and pharmaceutical company databases, has the potential to become a short-course, safe and effective oral treatment, curing both acute and chronic HAT.

58e9e7aa3e8b6dc87c00000d	Which is the major RNA editing enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster?	Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature.  The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. dADAR also re-codes its own transcript, but the consequences of this auto-regulation in vivo are unclear Novel putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, Dalpha5, Dalpha6 and Dalpha7, in Drosophila melanogaster identify a new and highly conserved target of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-mediated A-to-I pre-mRNA editing The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing Aside from their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is not well understood.Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg. The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome. Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing.

The DNA-binding domain of the Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzyme contains SANT and SLIDE domains The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling enzyme Chd1 is a 168-kDa protein consisting of a double chromodomain, Snf2-related ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The presence of these domains in ISWI and Chd1 chromatin-remodelling enzymes may provide a means of efficiently harnessing the action of the Snf2-related ATPase domain for the purpose of nucleosome spacing and provide an explanation for partial redundancy between these proteins. Here we identify the chromatin remodelling protein Chd1 (chromo-ATPase/helicase-DNA binding domain 1) as a component of SAGA and SLIK one of the two chromodomains of Chd1 specifically interacts with the methylated lysine 4 mark on histone H3 that is associated with transcriptional activity Human but not yeast CHD1 binds directly and selectively to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 via its tandem chromodomains In the current study, we identify human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4 human CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein. We find that the yeast Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes preferentially move nucleosomes toward more central locations on short DNA fragments whereas Isw1b does not.

However, a key difference is that the Isw1a, Isw2, and Chd1 enzymes are unable to move nucleosomes to positions closer than 15 bp from a DNA end, whereas Isw1b can. The ISWI and CHD1 chromatin remodelling activities influence ADH2 expression and chromatin organization Here we show that the absence of the Isw1 and Chd1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling activities delays the maximal expression of ADH2 without impairing the chromatin remodelling that occurs upon activation. Thus, the ISWI and Chd1 remodelling factors are not only involved in transcription-related chromatin remodelling, but also are required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the yeast genome. the lack of Chd1 combined with the absence of Isw1 and Isw2 impairs nucleosome spacing along the ADH2 gene, and genome-wide in S. cerevisiae Through inclusion of Chd1 sequences in homology searches SLIDE domains were identified in CHD6-9 proteins.  The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster.  Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9. Histone H3K4 and K36 methylation, Chd1 and Rpd3S oppose the functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4-Spt5 in transcription. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. Thus, while CHD1 is localized to transcriptionally active regions of the genome, it can function to alter the levels of HP1a, perhaps through changes in methylation of H3K9.  Chromodomain from heterochromatin protein 1 and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine-methylated histone H3 tail-binding module. Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, containing two tandem chromodomains. Over-expression of an ATPase inactive form of CHD1 did not result in severe chromosomal defects, suggesting that the ATPase activity is required for this in vivo phenotype. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II. Interestingly, changes in CHD1 protein levels did not correlate with changes in the levels of the euchromatin mark H3K4me3 or elongating RNA Polymerase II.	['Chd1 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase']
58a32efe60087bc10a000013	What is MRSA?	(MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) Community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a severe health concern because of its treatment difficulties. We investigated the distribution of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) on and around six patients with MRSA infection in our neurosurgical ward. The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at respiratory sites shed viable MRSA into the air of hospital rooms. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in prevalence among asymptomatic carriers and in cases of paediatric soft-tissue infections alike. Most of MRSA strains and a part of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains harbored unique combinations of non-ß-lactamase genes aac(6)/aph(2″), aph(3)-III, ant (4,4″), ermA, ermC, mrsA, tetM, and tetK Healthcare- and Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Fatal Pneumonia with Pediatric Deaths in Krasnoyarsk, Siberian Russia: Unique MRSAs Multiple Virulence Factors, Genome, and Stepwise Evolution It was found in the present study that combined use of fusidic acid (FA) and berberine chloride (BBR) offered an in vitro synergistic action against 7 of the 30 clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, with a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index ranging from 0.5 to 0.19 Vancomycin MIC creep in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from 2006 to 2010 in a hospital in China To assess whether vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creeps among clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a regional hospital in China Detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in specimens from various body sites: performance characteristics of the BD GeneOhm MRSA assay, the Xpert MRSA assay, and broth-enriched culture in an area with a low prevalence of MRSA infections.

Long-term control of endemic hospital-wide methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the impact of targeted active surveillance for MRSA in patients and healthcare workers. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections pose a major challenge in health care, yet the limited heterogeneity within this group hinders molecular investigations of related outbreaks. In a previous study, we reported that two kaempferol glycosides isolated from Laurus nobilis L., kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2'',4''-di-E-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C2) and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl-4''-Z-p-coumaroyl)-rhamnoside (C3), showed strong antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This article explains what methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is, how it is spread and what the real challenges are in healthcare settings in the UK. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging threat to public health, especially in correctional settings. There are few more compelling questions in clinical microbiology today than the issue of whether or not to screen for the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with the results being used to institute infection control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of MRSA in health care environments.

550af222c2af5d5b7000000b	Which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates IkB leading to its proteasomal degradation?	IKK activation and IκB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, β-TrCP, recognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples IκB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TrCP) -mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP results in accumulation of all the IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition.  Sequence comparison analysis showed sequence motif identity between CLU and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), a main E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IkappaB-alpha degradation. IkappaB degradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we show that beta-catenin stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein betaTrCP1, and identify the RNA-binding protein CRD-BP (coding region determinant-binding protein) as a previously unknown target of beta-catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRD-BP binds to the coding region of betaTrCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRD-BP stabilizes betaTrCP1 mRNA and elevates betaTrCP1 levels (both in cells and in vivo), resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)(betaTrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including IkappaB and beta-catenin.  The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation.

5d3826427bc3fee31f00000f	What percentage of patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) develop recurrent disease?	IMRT group achieved better locoregional control rate, with the 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) were 84.9% and 87.7% among patients received 2D-RT and IMRT, respectively (P = 0.050) The patients were divided into the local recurrence (n = 39), fibrosis (n = 51), clivus recurrence (n = 22), and clivus nonrecurrence (n = 48) groups.   Serum was collected from 40 patients with NPC [recurrence (n=20) and no recurrence (n=20)]. Compared to non‑recurrent NPC (nrNPC), we found 59 proteins to be significantly dysregulated in rNPC; most of these have been previously reported to play a role in carcinogenesis.  With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively.

An 8-year-old girl received 53 grays radiotherapy after surgery for craniopharyngioma. One year later she developed generalized dystonia Pharmacological treatment with tetrabenazine, clonazepam and trihexiphenydile allowed a very limited improvement of dystonia; welve cases of status dystonicus, of various underlying aetiologies, are presented Drug therapy with benzhexol, tetrabenazine and pimozide or haloperidol may be beneficial in some cases. Over the past 15 years we have treated 526 patients with severe hyperkinetic movement disorders with tetrabenazine (TBZ) The global response rating of 1 (marked improvement) was recorded in 89.2% of 93 patients with tardive stereotypy, 83.3% of 12 with myoclonus, 82.8% of 29 with Huntington's disease, 80.5% of 82 with tardive dystonia, 79.3% of 29 with other movement disorders, 62.9% of 108 with idiopathic dystonia Twelve adults with severe axial dystonia, and two children with life-threatening generalised dystonia were treated with a combination of a low constant dose of tetrabenazine to which were added pimozide and benzhexol as necessary. When benzhexol treatment alone fails in adults with severe disabling axial dystonia, or in children with life-threatening generalised dystonia, combined therapy with tetrabenazine, pimozide and benzhexol may give valuable symptomatic relief.

514a0a57d24251bc05000051	Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?	Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It is widely used as an antidote in comatose patients suspected of having ingested a benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of sedation from benzodiazepines administered during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and during induction or maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for benzodiazepine overdose. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. A 54-y-old man ingested 2 g of bulk laboratory diazepam and was treated with activated charcoal, enhanced diuresis and flumazenil infusion. Flumazenil is a specific and competitive antagonist at the central benzodiazepine receptor, reversing all effects of benzodiazepine agonists without tranquillising or anticonvulsant actions. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic conscious sedation has not been defined. To develop clinical rules for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Flumazenil is best left for reversal of therapeutic conscious sedation and rare select cases of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. It improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic efficacy. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17 patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and 58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. The results of this study confirm published reports of the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients with benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful in reversing the sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants. The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). The efficacy and safety of flumazenil were assessed in comparison to placebo in a double-blind randomised study of 31 adults intoxicated with benzodiazepines. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation, and orientation in time and space. Patients who received flumazenil awoke within minutes but central depression returned partly one hour later, which reflects the short elimination half-life of the drug. Side effects were few and the results indicate that flumazenil is effective in the primary management of benzodiazepine overdose and in states where benzodiazepines have been taken with other drugs. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of unknown origin.	['flumazenil']

By applying EMSA and ChIP methodologies in mouse erythroleukemia cells we show that GATA1 and PU.1 bind in vitro and in vivo the proximal promoter region of the RPS19 gene which is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a specific deficiency in erythroid progenitors. Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by hypoproliferative anemia, associated physical malformations and a predisposition to cancer.

514a51c2d24251bc0500005c	Which pituitary adenoma is common cause of infertility is women?	Prolactinoma is the most common secreting pituitary adenoma. It is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age and is common cause of infertility. Examination of the tissue excised by transsphenoidal excision of the mass showed a pituitary adenoma that stained strongly for FSH. RESULTS: Regular menses resumed soon after excision of the gonadotroph adenoma, followed by a spontaneous pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected in a reproductive age woman with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, multiple preovulatory follicles, and a persistently elevated serum estradiol concentration. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, occurring mostly in women and presenting most commonly with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Causes of hyperprolactinemia include physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic factors; pituitary adenoma is a common pathologic cause. Women may present with decreased libido, infertility, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and galactorrhea. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). Pregnancy in a woman with active acromegaly is very rare, because amenorrhea, due to hyperprolactinemia and disturbed pituitary gonadotropin secretion may cause infertility. Of the remaining six patients who had been investigated for infertility, no demonstrable cause of infertility was found in three. Of the other three patients, one showed evidence of bilateral tubal occlusion secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, one has had a right ectopic pregnancy followed by two abortions, and the third patient was found to have a pituitary adenoma. Results in 136 hyperprolactinaemic women who presented with infertility, amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and/or galactorrhoea are reported. There was radiographic evidence of pituitary microadenoma in 21 (15.4%) patients and 5 (3.7%) had macroadenoma. Patients with pituitary adenoma had a significantly higher (p less than 0.001) baseline serum prolactin level (182 +/- 4.6 ng/ml) than those with no adenoma (59.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml). All patients in the study were treated with bromocriptine (2.5-10 mg) to normalize serum prolactin or to achieve a pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between the patients with or without pituitary adenoma. Two hyperprolactinemic infertile women, one with and one without a pituitary adenoma, who were resistant to bromocriptine treatment, were treated orally with Hachimijiogan, a Chinese herbal medicine. Infertility caused by hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea may be complicated by pituitary adenoma.	['prolactinoma']

56e0447a51531f7e3300000b	Which are the smallest known subviral pathogens of plants?	Since the discovery of non-coding, small, highly structured, satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and viroids as subviral pathogens of plants , have been of great interest to molecular biologists as possible living fossils of pre-cellular evolution in an RNA world. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants.  Viroids are plant subviral pathogens whose genomes are constituted by a single-stranded and covalently closed small RNA molecule that does not encode for any protein.  Viroids are small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules that cause several infectious plant diseases.  Viroids: petite RNA pathogens with distinguished talents. Subviral pathogens of plants: viroids and viroidlike satellite RNAs. Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses are not the smallest causative agents of infectious diseases. Single-stranded RNAs as small as 246 nucleotides exist in certain higher plants and cause more than a dozen crop diseases. These RNAs have been termed viroids. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. Subviral pathogens of plants: the viroids. Viroids, subviral pathogens of plants, are composed of a single-stranded circular RNA of 246-399 nucleotides. During 1970 and 1971, I discovered that a devastating disease of potato plants is not caused by a virus, as had been assumed, but by a new type of subviral pathogen, the viroid. Viroids are so small--one fiftieth of the size of the smallest viruses--that many scientists initially doubted their existence.  The database of the smallest known auto-replicable RNA species: viroids and viroid-like RNAs. Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the &apos;brotherhood&apos; of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs.  Replicating circular RNAs are independent plant pathogens known as viroids, or act to modulate the pathogenesis of plant and animal viruses as their satellite RNAs. The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming.	['Viroids']
52bf1d9e03868f1b06000010	To the ligand of which receptors does Denosumab (Prolia) bind?	Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. Treatment of AML cells with the clinically available RANKL Ab Denosumab resulted in enhanced NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity.  The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the "vicious cycle" of bone destruction induced by these cells. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. In the future, the armamentarium against osteoporotic fractures will likely be enriched by (1.) new bone anabolic substances such as antibodies directed against the endogenous inhibitors of bone formation sclerostin and dickkopf-1, PTH and PTHrp analogues, and possibly calcilytics; (2.) new inhibitors of bone resorption such as cathepsin K inhibitors which may suppress osteoclast function without impairing osteoclast viability and thus maintain bone formation by preserving the osteoclast-osteoblast crosstalk, and denosumab, an already widely available antibody against RANKL which inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival; and (3.) new therapeutic strategies based on an extended understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis which may include sequential therapies with two or more bone active substances aimed at optimising the management of bone capital acquired during adolescence and maintained during adulthood in terms of both quantity and quality.  Clearly, the approval of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL, has just marked the beginning of a new era for bone therapy with several additional new therapies lining up for clinical approval in the coming years. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months. More recently, a nuclear factor-β ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been             developed for the treatment of bone metastases. Denosumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to RANKL and has recently been found to inhibit SRE more effectively than BP.  Recently, denosumab, a noncytotoxic IgG2 monoclonal antibody with high affinity for human RANKL, has been demonstrated to significantly prevent clinically relevant increase in pain compared with zoledronic acid across the tumor types.  Denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody with proven antiosteoclast activity, may suppress immune responses.  We also review unresolved controversies surrounding the management of these conditions by administration of nutritional vitamin D (ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol), vitamin D receptor activators (calcitriol, alphacalcidiol, doxercalciferol), D-mimetics (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol), calcimimetics (cinacalcet), recombinant PTH (teriparatide), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand modulators (denosumab); compare mortality predictability of PTH and alkaline phosphatase; and examine potential risks of bone disorders and mineral disarrays in CKD patients. New therapies such as the antibody to RANKL (denosumab) are undergoing phase III clinical testing.  Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand is an important cytokine involved in osteoclast activation; denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to this molecule, has finished a major fracture trial.  Initials studies have demonstrated that targeting RANK/ RANKL signaling with the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab prevented skeletal complications in patients with MM and other cancers with bone metastases.  A highly specific, fully human antibody against RANKL has been produced (denosumab) that in early studies in humans reduces bone turnover and improves bone density. Denosumab (AMG 162), a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, shares the pharmacologic attributes of OPG but has a significantly longer half-life that allows less frequent administration.

56c4d14ab04e159d0e000003	Do the Sleeping Beauty or the piggyBac transposons have higher transposition efficiency?	Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis.  We found that PB demonstrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2 mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively.  However, recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB.  Here, we compared the efficiency of two different transposon systems, Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB), for the generation of murine iPS.  However, recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. In this study, we compared the genomic integration efficiencies and transposition site preferences of Sleeping Beauty (SB or SB11), Tol2, and piggyBac (PB) transposon systems in primary T cells derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). We found that PB demonstrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2 mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively.  Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. Although Sleeping Beauty had no detectable genomic bias with respect to insertions in genes or intergenic regions, both Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons displayed preferential integration into actively transcribed loci. We have compared the chromosomal mobilization efficiency and insertion site preference of the two transposons mobilized from the same donor site in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions in which there were no selective constraints on the transposons&apos; insertion sites. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis.

533ba218fd9a95ea0d000007	What is the clinical indication of cardiac T1 mapping magnetic resonance?	More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods.  Recent T1 mapping techniques aim to overcome the limitations of late gadolinium enhancement to assess diffuse fibrosis. T1 mapping techniques performed both with and without contrast are enabling quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and myocardial infiltration. Noncontrast T1 mapping has high diagnostic accuracy for detecting cardiac AL amyloidosis, correlates well with markers of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and is potentially more sensitive for detecting early disease than LGE imaging. T1 mapping has been proposed as potentially valuable in the quantitative assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, but no studies to date have systematically evaluated its role in the differentiation of healthy myocardium from diffuse disease in a clinical setting.  This study demonstrates that native and post-contrast T1 values provide indexes with high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of normal and diffusely diseased myocardium. T1 values lengthened with greater LVMI and correlated with the degree of biopsy-quantified fibrosis. This may provide a useful clinical assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in the future. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping has been used to characterize myocardial diffuse fibrosis.  In HCM and DCM, noncontrast T1 mapping detects underlying disease processes beyond those assessed by LGE in relatively low-risk individuals.

51542e44d24251bc05000081	Mutations in which gene determine response to both erlotinib and gefitinib?	Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are frequently observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have transformed therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and have proved superior to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for this patient group. Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are promising therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs. NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases. Patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and active EGFR mutation have a high response rate (60-70%) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with little immediate progression (primary resistance). Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. EGFR-TKI yields a long survival period in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with EGFR gene mutations, Efficacy of erlotinib was recognized in the cases in which disease control was obtained by initial treatment with gefitinib. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who carry epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations respond remarkably well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib, or erlotinib. lung adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib; The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated treatments with these drugs. These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to other EGFR-TKIs. The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this seemed to be the cause of drug resistance. Patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma exhibiting overexpression or mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor tend to respond better to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with adenocarcinoma and never smokers. Some common somatic mutations in EGFR, including deletion mutations in exon 19 and leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 858 (L858R) in exon 21, have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib, which are selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in lung adenocarcinomas that respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)(such as gefitinib or erlotinib)treatment of lung cancer harboring EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies. patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations who received CSF examinations during epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment (250 mg daily gefitinib or 150 mg daily erlotinib). The evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as gefitinib and erlotinib was first confirmed as the second-line treatment for non-selective patients with advanced NSCLC. patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, the first-line treatment with gefitinib had achieved a significant prolongation of progression-free survival compared with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in a few phase III trials, and became a new standard of care. Gefitinib is highly effective for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation even if their performance status is poor, although one should always pay careful attention to fatal interstitial lung disease. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), which are molecularly targeted drugs, and it has now become possible to select treatment methods by choosing from a number of anticancer drugs. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to have a very high cytoreductive effect on lung cancers that have EGFR gene mutations. EGFR gene mutations at kinase domain in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers led to development of the small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been found in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with good clinical response to gefitinib therapy. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.

5a4e50b242878bf97d000001	Which topoisomerase is essential in yeast?	Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function. The type II topoisomerase may have an essential role in the compaction and/or segregation of chromosomes during the nuclear division but also complement the defect of the type I enzyme whose major function is the maintenance of chromatin organization throughout the cell cycle. Since DNA topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) is an essential enzyme in yeast, heterologous topoisomerase II gene expression in yeast cells can provide a system for analyzing the structure and function of topoisomerase II genes from other species. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is essential for cell proliferation.  Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous enzyme that removes knots and tangles from the genetic material by generating transient double-strand DNA breaks. While the enzyme cannot perform its essential cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromosomal integrity. Topoisomerase II (Topo II) performs topological modifications on double-stranded DNA molecules that are essential for chromosome condensation, resolution, and segregation.  Type II topoisomerases are essential for resolving topologically entwined double-stranded DNA. A DNA topoisomerases are specialized nuclear enzymes that perform topological modifications on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and hence are essential for DNA metabolism such as replication, transcription, recombination, condensation and segregation. Eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) is the essential decatenase of newly replicated chromosomes and the main relaxase of nucleosomal DNA.  The decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II is essential for viability as eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Studies with yeast DNA topoisomerase mutants indicate that neither topoisomerase I nor II appears to be essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II. The gene encoding topoisomerase II in yeast is unique and essential, required for both mitotic and meiotic proliferation. The decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase II is essential for viability as eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene.

5324ce779b2d7acc7e00001e	Which drug is considered as the first line treatment of fibromyalgia?	Multimodal approaches seem to be the treatment of choice in fibromyalgia A multidisciplinary program was developed and implemented for patients with fibromyalgia in the primary care setting. The program included education (seven sessions) and physical therapy (25 sessions). Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines.  Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, but only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Valproic acid and its sodium salt (sodium valproate) are antiepileptic drugs that are sometimes used to treat chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, although they are not licensed for this use.  Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pregabalin is, therefore, a valuable option in the first-line treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.	['Pregabalin']
52b2e1d8f828ad283c00000c	What is the indication of Daonil (Glibenclamide)?	Metformin and glibenclamide are now increasingly viewed as a rational alternative to insulin therapy--a treatment both preferred by the women and a less expensive one, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The effect of TFG on blood glucose were studied and the levels of lipid peroxidation [MDA (Malondialdehyde)] and antioxidant enzymes [SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GPx (Reduced Glutathione peroxidase)] were estimated and compared with standard drugs glibenclamide and insulin. Treatment with TFG, insulin and glibenclamide resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose in LM (8.71%) and HM (3.87%) in comparison with normal controls. Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect. However, dietary supplementation with PB (6 g/kg extract for 4 weeks administered orally using an intragastric tube) ameliorated the alloxan-induced diabetes in a manner comparable with that of the reference antidiabetic drug glibenclamide Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). In mild NIDDM, gliclazide, tolbutamide or acetohexamide is used, and in more severe NIDDM glibenclamide is used. An improvement of the glucose tolerance could be observed up to 3 years, whereas after a 5-year glibenclamide therapy no certain influence on the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion could be proved. In general the improvement of the glucose tolerance was not associated with an increased secretion of insulin, so that an extrapancreatic effect of glibenclamide (improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity?) seems to be possible. From clinical and practical point of view the findings would support the opinion that normal weight persons with IGT, particularly in already decreased insulin secretion, have an indication for a glibenclamide therapy.

5a7617b183b0d9ea66000022	What is inhibited by a drug rilotumumab?	The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) was targeted in untreated patients in a phase III trial with MoAb rilotumumab, with or without CT, but the study was stopped because of mortality excess in the rilotumumab arm.  AIMS: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody investigated for the treatment of MET-positive gastric cancer.  The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binding antibody rilotumumab (AMG102) was modified for use as a89Zr-based immuno-PET imaging agent to noninvasively determine the local levels of HGF protein in tumors.  Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.

5708a845cf1c32585100000f	Which signaling pathway is activating the dishevelled proteins?	Wnt signaling is known to be important for diverse embryonic and post-natal cellular events and be regulated by the proteins Dishevelled and Axin. Although Dishevelled is activated by Wnt and involved in signal transduction, it is not clear how Dishevelled-mediated signaling is turned off.  The Dishevelled protein mediates several diverse biological processes. Intriguingly, within the same tissues where Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) controls cell fate via canonical Wnt signaling, Dishevelled (DVL) proteins, three of which have been identified in humans, are highly conserved components of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways.

56c58ceeb04e159d0e000004	What is the function of circular RNA?	Here we determine the structure of these novel transcripts, showing that they correspond to circular RNA molecules containing only exons in genomic order. Thousands of loci in the human and mouse genomes give rise to circular RNA transcripts; at many of these loci, the predominant RNA isoform is a circle. Analysis of data from the ENCODE consortium revealed that the repertoire of genes expressing circular RNA, the ratio of circular to linear transcripts for each gene, and even the pattern of splice isoforms of circular RNAs from each gene were cell-type specific. These results suggest that biogenesis of circular RNA is an integral, conserved, and regulated feature of the gene expression program. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs.  For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. An unexpectedly large fraction of genes in metazoans (human, mouse, zebrafish, worm, fruit fly) express high levels of circularized RNAs containing canonical exons. A minority of genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products of alternative splicing or 'piggyback' on signals used in alternative RNA processing. Circular RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases.  Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges Circular RNAs can function as templates for viroid and viral replication, as intermediates in RNA processing reactions, as regulators of transcription in cis, as snoRNAs, and as miRNA sponges. Herein, we review the breadth of circular RNAs, their biogenesis and metabolism, and their known and anticipated functions.

58e75d483e8b6dc87c000005	Which gene controls the expression of GATA-1 isoforms?	Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.  This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation. Novel combinatorial interactions of GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms regulate transcription of the gene encoding eosinophil granule major basic protein. Furthermore, we observe that in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver cells, low levels of the IE GATA-1 isoform is expressed, but the variant IB isoform is absent. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27)..

532498959b2d7acc7e000017	Which enzyme is targeted by the drug Imetelstat?	Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. In preclinical trials, this compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo xenograft mouse models.  In addition to the inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines, GRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changes, independent of hTR expression or telomere length. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths  Telomerase extension is less processive during the first few weeks following the reversal of long-term treatment with the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L), a time when Cajal bodies fail to deliver telomerase RNA to telomeres. The role of telomerase as an immunotherapy, as a gene therapy approach using telomerase promoter driven oncolytic viruses and as a small oligonucleotide targeted therapy (Imetelstat) will be discussed We then tested the efficacy of the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat on propagation and self-renewal capacity of TIC and normal stem cells in vitro and in vivo. R e telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC. Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase. Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo.  Short oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate conjugated to 5'-palmitoyl group, designated as GRN163L (Imetelstat), was recently introduced as a potent human telomerase inhibitor etelstat (GRN163L)--telomerase-based cancer therapy. Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical trials. e telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, efficiently targets glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells leading to decreased proliferation and tumor growth. The effects of a novel human telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, on primary human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor-initiating cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo.  Imetelstat treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase (IC(50) 0.45 micromol/L). Long-term imetelstat treatment led to progressive telomere shortening, reduced rates of proliferation, and eventually cell death in GBM tumor-initiating cells.  We have found that prostate TICs have significant telomerase activity which is inhibited by imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), a new telomerase antagonist that is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for several hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Prostate TICs telomeres were of similar average length to the telomeres of the main population of cells and significant telomere shortening was detected in prostate TICs as a result of imetelstat treatment.  Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor.	['Human Telomerase']

5c72ade07c78d69471000070	Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug Lorlatinib?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents.RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib. IMPORTANCE: The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in 2-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients led to the rapid clinical development of its oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment. RESULTS: ALK T1151Sins mutation was detected when the patient developed resistance to ceritinib, and undetectable when she responded to lorlatinib.  ALK G1202R, the most frequent plasma mutation detected after progression on a second-generation TKI, was consistently suppressed during treatment with lorlatinib. Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011).  Brain Penetration of the ROS1/ALK Inhibitor Lorlatinib Confirmed by PET.F-labeling strategies to synthesize isotopologs of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) which is undergoing phase III clinical trial investigations for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with specific molecular alterations.  In addition, further functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ALK harboring the T1151Sins mutation, while conferring resistance to ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib. Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts brain accumulation and cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits oral availability of the novel ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib. Lorlatinib is a third generation ALK inhibitor that inhibits most ALK mutants resistant to current ALK inhibitors. Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a next-generation small-molecule inhibitor of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which has a kinase domain that is physiologically related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trial investigations for non-small cell lung cancers. BACKGROUND Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations. The next-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib (PF-06463922) has therefore been developed to inhibit resistant ALK mutations, including ALK G1202R, and to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. BACKGROUND Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations.	['anaplastic lymphoma kinase']
5545e65bd355485447000001	Patients of which disease could be treated by utilizing knowledge obtained from experiments suppressing TDP-43 toxicity in yeast?	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS	['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)']
56cf20eb3975bb303a000001	What does isradipine do to L-type channels?	The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. Systemic administration of isradipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of L-type channels, forces dopaminergic neurons in rodents to revert to a juvenile, Ca(2+)-independent mechanism to generate autonomous activity. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. What distinguishes snail and mammalian L-type channels is a difference in dihydropyridine sensitivity: 100 nM isradipine exhibits a significant block of mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 currents without effect on snail LCa(v)1 currents. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. During control stimulation of the presynaptic GABAergic neuron at 40 Hz for 1-2 s, DeltaF/F(0) increased rapidly to a peak value and started to decline shortly after the train ended, returning to baseline within 10-20 s. The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. The L-type channel antagonist isradipine is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockade with isradipine as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Effects of isradipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker on permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. Omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N type calcium channel antagonist and flunarizine, a nonselective T-type calcium channel antagonist were without effect. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.	['antagonizes', 'blocks']

55450521bf90a13052000001	What is the effect of enamel matrix derivative on pulp regeneration?	Among the human studies, two studies reported that EMD is a more efficient DPC procedure compared with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 ). One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC procedures EMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCs  the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulated EMD could enhance the mineralization of hDPSCs upregulated the expression of markers for odontoblast/osteoblast-like cells. Further studies are required to determine if EMD can improve pulp tissue repair and regeneration In both the scaffold groups, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin messenger RNA was up-regulated significantly in EMD-treated hDPCs when compared with the nontreated cells Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposure In the EMD-treated teeth, large amounts of newly formed dentin-like hard tissue with associated formative cells outlined the pulpal wound separating the cavity area from the remaining pulp tissue Inflammatory cells were present in the wound area but not subjacent to the newly formed hard tissue. Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p < 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide	['increase of the osteogenic potential of hDPCs']
5c78080e7c78d694710000ae	What is the cause of Sandhoff disease?	Sandhoff disease (SD) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the β-subunit gene β-hexosaminidase B (HexB) in humans, which results in the massive accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and related glycosphingolipids in the nervous system. Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside.  Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of β-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Sandhoff disease (SD) results from mutations in the HEXB gene, subsequent deficiency of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase (Hex) and accumulation of GM2 gangliosides	['Sandhoff disease (SD) is caused by a mutation of the β-subunit gene β-hexosaminidase B (HexB) in humans']
