5aa67b6ad6d6b54f79000010	What is Paget's Disease?	Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a noninflammatory, metabolic, skeletal disorder characterized by localized excessive osteoclastic bone resorption that is followed by compensatory increased osteoblastic activity leading to unstructured, fibroblastic, and biomechanically unstable bone. As a result, there is deformity and enlargement of the bone with a defective and disorganized pattern. Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is the second most common metabolic bone disorder, after osteoporosis. It is characterised by focal areas of increased and disorganised bone turnover, coupled with increased bone formation.  Adult PD of bone is the second commonest metabolic bone condition after osteoporosis. The condition is characterized by increased bone cell activity, with bone-resorbing osteoclasts often larger and containing more nuclei than normal, and osteoblasts producing increased amounts of disorganized bone. This leads to expanded bone of poor quality possessing both sclerotic and lytic areas Paget's disease of bone is a disorder of bone remodelling, leading to changes in the architecture and overall appearance of the bone.  Unlike previously described cases of mammary, vulvar, and perianal Paget disease, esophageal Paget cells are almost universally associated with underlying adenocarcinoma and not with high grade dysplasia ("in situ" disease) or primary Paget disease. Paget's disease is the most exaggerated example of bone remodeling in which abnormal osteoclastic bone resorption remains coupled to new bone formation. Paget's disease of bone is characterized by the progressive and extensive replacement, in one or several bones, of normal bone tissue by a bone tissue of rough and irregular structure, the excessive and disorderly renewal of which gradually produces hyperdensity and hypertrophy of the bones involved. Sixty-five percent (15/23) of the Paget's disease of the breast had  50% of Paget cells expressing E-cadherin, and for plakoglobin and beta-catenin it was 17% (4/23) and 28% (6/21), respectively. Paget disease of the vulva can be mimicked by several disease entities histopathologically, but most of these entities can be clinically distinguished from vulvar Paget disease. Paget's disease is an intra-epidermal adenocarcinoma seen over the nipple/areola (mammary Paget's disease) or in extramammary body zones, such as the anogenital and perineal skin and the axilla. BACKGROUND Mammary Paget's disease and extramammary Paget's disease are neoplastic conditions, in which there is intraepithelial (usually intraepidermal) infiltration by neoplastic cells showing glandular differentiation. Mammary Paget's disease and extramammary Paget's disease are rare intraepithelial neoplasms. Mammary Paget's disease is almost exclusively associated with underlying invasive breast carcinoma or high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS G3). Paget's disease is primarily a disease of the osteoclast. Paget's disease of bone is a chronic focal skeletal disorder characterized by increased bone resorption by the osteoclasts. Paget's disease of bone is a focal disorder of aging bone. Paget's disease of the bone is a chronic osteopathy that leads to structural weakness, hypervascularity, and bone deformities. Paget's disease of the breast is a disorder of the nipple-areola complex that, while rare, is often associated with an underlying carcinoma. It is characterized by eczematoid changes of the nipple. Paget's disease of the breast is a rare disorder of the nipple-areola complex that is often associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma.

5e2905da8b3851296d000009	Describe mechanism of action of volanesorsen.	 Clinical trials with Volanesorsen, an APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide, report very promising lipid-lowering outcomes. An antisense oligonucleotide to apolipoprotein-C3, volanesorsen has been shown to decrease TGs by 70-80% and possibly to reduce rates of pancreatitis admissions.  BACKGROUND: Volanesorsen, an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis, significantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including recurrent abdominal pain and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP). Further studies should address the effect of omega-3 PUFAs alone or with other lipid-lowering drugs in order to provide a final answer whether apo C-III could be an important target for prevention of cardiovascular disease New apo C-III antisense oligonucleotide drug (Volanesorsen) showed to be promising in decreasing elevated TGs by reducing levels of apo C-III mRNA. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles.  Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others.

However, because this is a small study without statistical comparison with the placebo group, the efficacy and safety of eculizumab could be investigated in larger, randomised controlled trials. At week 4, the proportion of the patients able to walk independently (functional grade ≤2) was 61% (90% CI 42-78; n=14) in the eculizumab group, and 45% (20-73; n=5) in the placebo group. Adverse events occurred in all 34 patients. Three patients had serious adverse events: two in the eculizumab group (anaphylaxis in one patient and intracranial haemorrhage and abscess in another patient) and one in the placebo group (depression). For the primary efficacy outcome at 4 weeks after recruitment, two of two placebo- and two of five eculizumab-treated subjects had improved by one or more grades on the GBS DS.

The increasing adoption of clinical whole-genome resequencing (WGS) demands for highly accurate and reproducible variant calling (VC) methods. The observed discordance between state-of-the-art VC pipelines, however, indicates that the current practice still suffers from non-negligible numbers of false positive and negative SNV and INDEL calls that were shown to be enriched among discordant calls but also in genomic regions with low sequence complexity.RESULTS: Here, we describe our method ReliableGenome (RG) for partitioning genomes into high and low concordance regions with respect to a set of surveyed VC pipelines. Our method combines call sets derived by multiple pipelines from arbitrary numbers of datasets and interpolates expected concordance for genomic regions without data. By applying RG to 219 deep human WGS datasets, we demonstrate that VC concordance depends predominantly on genomic context rather than the actual sequencing data which manifests in high recurrence of regions that can/cannot be reliably genotyped by a single method. This enables the application of pre-computed regions to other data created with comparable sequencing technology and software.

5a6fa9f7b750ff4455000061	Describe Click-PEGylation	Click-PEGylation - A mobility shift approach to assess the redox state of cysteines in candidate proteins. One approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation, we have utilised a Click chemistry approach, where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. Separation of the thiol labelling step from the PEG conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach. Here we show how the Click-PEGylation technique can be used to interrogate the redox state of proteins.

Variant proteins of the Plasmodium falciparum RIFIN family show distinct subcellular localization and developmental expression patterns. Interestingly, some RIFIN variants were detected only in intracellular stages and not in merozoites, pointing to differential developmental expression patterns for distinct members of this large protein family.

RIFIN products are targets for the human immune response and contribute to the antigenic variability of the parasite. They are transmembrane proteins grouped into two sub-families (RIF_A and RIF_B). Although recent data show that RIF_A and RIF_B have different sub-cellular localisations and possibly different functions, the same structural organisation has been proposed for members of the two sub-families.

56a8b1a5a17756b72f000004	What is the mechanism of DNA replication termination in vertebrates?	Eukaryotic DNA replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge. Termination involves local completion of DNA synthesis, decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. We show that DNA synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative CMG helicase (comprising CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS) occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of DNA synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging CMGs pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded DNA. This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of DNA synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly	['Eukaryotic DNA replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge.

DNA synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative CMG helicase (comprising CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS) occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of DNA synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging CMGs pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded DNA. This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of DNA synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.']

5c65ae757c78d6947100000a	Describe the bartender algorithm	Bartender: a fast and accurate clustering algorithm to count barcode reads. Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing-from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data.Results: In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.Availability and implementation: Bartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1.

The genetic-epidemiologic and biochemical evidence in ALDH2-deficient humans provides strong evidence for the causal relationship between acetaldehyde-exposure due to alcohol consumption and cancer of the upper digestive tract. Diabetic patients with ALDH2 mutations are predisposed to worse diastolic dysfunction. In alcohol drinkers, ALDH2-deficiency is a well-known risk factor for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, i.e., head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer. eater in ALDH2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that ALDH2 deficiency enhances EtOH-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions, barrier dysfunction, and liver damage.

53175e68b166e2b806000009	What is the effect of ROS on cyclin B1?	The present study was undertaken to determine whether sulforaphane-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) might cause growth arrest and apoptosis in human bladder cancer 5637 cells. Our results show that the reduced viability of 5637 cells by sulforaphane is due to mitotic arrest, but not the G2 phase. The sulforaphane-induced mitotic arrest correlated with an induction of cyclin B1 and phosphorylation of Cdk1, as well as a concomitant increased complex between cyclin B1 and Cdk1. Further mechanistic studies revealed that induction of apoptosis is associated with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to cytosol, upregulation of Bax, p21 and p53, and down-regulation of Bcl-2, cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). LDH inhibition by oxamate induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via downregulation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 pathway and promoted apoptosis through enhancement of mitochondrial ROS generation. N-acetylcysteine, a specific scavenger of ROS, significantly blocked the growth inhibition effect induced by oxamate. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Butyrate (> 2 mm) inhibited the expression of cdc2, cdc25C and cyclinB1 mRNAs and reduced the levels of Cdc2, Cdc25C and cyclinB1 proteins in GFs, as determined using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. This toxic effect of butyrate was associated with the production of ROS. Furthermore, costunolide induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase via decrease in Cdc2, cyclin B1 and increase in p21WAF1 expression, In addition, costunolide had a slight induced effect on ROS generation. This study suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest was triggered by ROS/NO productions with regulations of p53, p21, cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which were able to be prevented by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity inhibitor genistein or JNK inhibitor SP600125. Other G(2)/M regulatory molecules such as Cdc25C, Cdk1, cyclin B1 were down-regulated by DIM. Blocking ROS generation by N-acetyl cysteine protects the cells from DIM-mediated G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that emodin mediated oxidative injury (DNA damage) based on ROS production and ER stress based on the levels of GADD153 and GRP78 that acts as an early and upstream change in the cell death cascade to caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways, triggers mitochondrial dysfunction from Bcl-2 and Bax modulation, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation, consequently leading to apoptosis in SCC-4 cells. In this study, treatment of human tongue cancer SCC-4 cells with various concentrations of emodin led to G2/M arrest through promoted p21 and Chk2 expression but inhibited cyclin B1 and cdc2; Further investigation revealed that plumbagin's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Blockade of cell cycle was associated with increased levels of p21, and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, Cdc2, and Cdc25C. We also found the generation of ROS is a critical mediator in plumbagin-induced cell growth inhibition. IOA exhibited effective cell growth inhibition by inducing cancer cells to undergo G(2)-M phase arrest and apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that IOA's inhibition of cell growth was also evident in a nude mice model. Cell cycle blockade was associated with increased levels of p21 and reduced amounts of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2, and cdc25C. We also found that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical mediator in IOA-induced cell growth inhibition.

5a9922981d1251d03b000007	How do circRNAs relate to tumorigenesis?	Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P<.001). Circ-FBXW7 expression positively associated with glioblastoma patient overall survival (P = .03). Novel Role of FBXW7 Circular RNA in Repressing Glioma Tumorigenesis. We report here the tumorigenic capacity of a circRNA derived from angiomotin-like1 (circ-Amotl1). Circ-Amotl1 is highly expressed in patient tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Single-cell inoculations using circ-Amotl1-transfected tumor cells showed a 30-fold increase in proliferative capacity relative to control. Agarose colony-formation assays similarly revealed a 142-fold increase.  Subcutaneous single-cell injections led to the formation of palpable tumors in 41% of mice, with tumor sizes>1 cm3in 1 month. We further found that this potent tumorigenicity was triggered through interactions between circ-Amotl1 and c-myc. Our study therefore reveals a novel function of circRNAs in tumorigenesis, and this subclass of noncoding RNAs may represent a potential target in cancer therapy.

56cad5df5795f9a73e000020	Where does TDP43 localize in ALS neurons?	In control motor neurons, TDP43 was almost exclusively nuclear, whereas in ALS spinal motor neurons, TDP43 was predominantly localized to the cytosol and not the nucleus.  The FUS/TLS protein binds to RNA, functions in diverse processes, and is normally located predominantly in the nucleus. In contrast, the mutant forms of FUS/TLS accumulated in the cytoplasm of neurons, a pathology that is similar to that of the gene TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), whose mutations also cause ALS. Neuronal cytoplasmic protein aggregation and defective RNA metabolism thus appear to be common pathogenic mechanisms involved in ALS and possibly in other neurodegenerative disorders. In control motor neurons, TDP43 was almost exclusively nuclear, whereas in ALS spinal motor neurons, TDP43 was predominantly localized to the cytosol and not the nucleus. TDP43 was observed as punctuate immunoreactivity and as dense skeins, with and without ubiquitinization.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant ER(+) human breast cancer cell lines and mice bearing PIK3CA-mutant xenografts were treated with the antiestrogen fulvestrant, the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (pictilisib; varied doses/schedules that provided similar amounts of drug each week), or combinations.  These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene. Phase II Randomized Preoperative Window-of-Opportunity Study of the PI3K Inhibitor Pictilisib Plus Anastrozole Compared With Anastrozole Alone in Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer. This preoperative window study assessed whether adding the PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941) can increase the antitumor effects of anastrozole in primary breast cancer and aimed to identify the most appropriate patient population for combination therapy. In contrast to parental cells, resistant cells were sensitive to growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by the class I PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941 (pictilisib), which also induced FOXO1 nuclear translocation. Using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform, we discovered that plasma concentrations of 26 metabolites, including amino acids, acylcarnitines, and phosphatidylcholines, were decreased in mice bearing PTEN-deficient tumors compared with non-tumor-bearing controls and in addition were increased following dosing with class I PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941).

58cd729502b8c6095300003d	What is known about saponins in crops and human consumption?	Saponins are readily soluble in water and are approved by the US FDA for inclusion in beverages intended for human consumption. The addition of saponins to existing water supplies offers a new form of intervention into the cycle of rotavirus infection. We believe that saponins will 'coat' the epithelium of the host's small intestine and prevent attachment of rotavirus. The levels of antinutrients in meal from the raw seeds were: trypsin inhibitor activity (14.6-28.7 mg trypsin inhibited/g), lectin (25.6-52.2 unit; one unit is the reverse of minimum amount of mg meal/ml assay which produced haemagglutination), saponins (1.9-2.3% as diosgenin equivalent) and phytate (8.4-10%). Quinoa cultivars currently grown in North America and Europe require removal of bitter-tasting saponins from the grain prior to human consumption.  Antinutrients, including phytate, glycoside, saponin and tannin, were screened and quantified. Phytate (112.82 ± 0.1 mg/100 g), glycoside (2.33 ± 0.00 mg/100 g), saponin (1.31 ± 0.00 mg/100g) and tannin (0.21 ± 0.00 mg/100 g) were present in the fruit but phlobatanin and glycosides with steroidal rings were not found. antinutritional factors (phytic acid, trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) and saponins)	['Saponins are considered antinutrients for humans and have a bitter taste.

533aaab6d6d3ac6a34000062	How is yellow fever virus transmitted?	Yellow Fever (YF) is an acute viral communicable disease transmitted by an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus. It is primarily a zoonotic disease, especially the monkeys. Worldwide, an estimated 200 000 cases of yellow fever occurred each year, and the case-fatality rate is ~15%. Forty-five endemic countries in Africa and Latin America, with a population of close to 1 billion, are at risk. Up to 50% of severely affected persons from YF die without treatment yellow fever virus (YFV) are transmitted between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts. While barriers limiting arbovirus population diversity have been observed in mosquitoes, whether barriers exist in vertebrate hosts is unclear. To investigate whether arboviruses encounter bottlenecks during dissemination in the vertebrate host, we infected immunocompetent mice and immune-deficient mice lacking alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) receptors (IFNAR⁻/⁻ mice) with a pool of genetically marked viruses to evaluate dissemination and host barriers Re-emergence of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever, which are both transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has been correlated with insecticide resistance.  Arthropod-borne viruses are important emerging pathogens world-wide. Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, infect hundreds of millions of people and animals each year. Global surveillance of these viruses in mosquito vectors using molecular based assays is critical for prevention and control of the associated diseases fever and dengue fever are mosquito-borne infectious diseases transmitted by Aedes aegyptii, the presence of yellow fever in Sudan and dengue fever in Saudi Arabia are threats to Egypt with the reemerging of Ae. aegyptii in Southern Egypt, larvae control is feasible than flying adults dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), that originated in sylvatic cycles maintained in non-human primates and forest-dwelling mosquitoes have emerged repeatedly into sustained human-to-human transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Sylvatic cycles of both viruses remain active, and where the two viruses overlap in West Africa they utilize similar suites of monkeys and Aedes mosquitoes First, the sylvatic cycle of YFV originated in Africa and was introduced into the New World, probably as a result of the slave trade, but is absent in Asia; in contrast, sylvatic DENV likely originated in Asia and has spread to Africa but not to the New World. Second, while sylvatic YFV can emerge into extensive urban outbreaks in humans, these invariably die out, whereas four different types of DENV have established human transmission cycles that are ecologically and evolutionarily distinct from their sylvatic ancestors Finally, transmission of YFV among humans has been documented only in Africa and the Americas, whereas DENV is transmitted among humans across most of the range of competent Aedes vectors, which in the last decade has included every continent save Antarctica Mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and filariasis are the main contributors to this burden yellow fever (YFV) viruses is increasing in many parts of the world. The viruses are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a highly domesticated mosquito species that is notoriously difficult to control. The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year The causative agent of yellow fever is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly in Africa. In the Central African Republic since 2006, cases have been notified in the provinces of Ombella-Mpoko, Ouham-Pende, Basse-Kotto, Haute-Kotto and in Bangui the capital. As the presence of a vector of yellow fever virus (YFV) represents a risk for spread of the disease, we undertook entomological investigations at these sites to identify potential vectors of YFV and their abundance  family Flaviviridae, includes a number of important arthropod-transmitted human pathogens such as dengue viruses, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus Reports of the detection of these viruses with no recognized pathogenic role in humans are increasing in mosquitoes collected around the world, particularly in those sampled in entomological surveys targeting pathogenic flaviviruses. The presence of six potential flaviviruses, detected from independent European arbovirus surveys undertaken in the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK between 2007 and 2010, is reported in this work Yellow Fever virus (YFV) is an important arboviral pathogen in much of sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical Americas. It is the prototype member of the genus Flavivirus and is transmitted primarily by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes. The incidence of human infections in endemic areas has risen in recent years. Prompt and dependable identification of YFV is a critical component of response to suspect cases Health-care professionals can help travelers by providing accurate pre-travel counseling for mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever. Governments and international organizations will benefit from knowledge survey among health professionals in this field to promote the development of travel health profession United States made 12 million visits to developing countries in Asia, South America, Central America, Oceania, the Middle East, and Africa.  Yellow fever is a serious illness public health importance and is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A	['Yellow fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is restricted to Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean. \nYellow fever virus is a flavivirus, and there is only one antigenic type. It was taken to the Americas by the early slave traders, and nowadays reported in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Yellow fever virus is transmitted by two different cycles: \n-from human to human by the mosquito Aedes aegypti; which is well-adapted to breeding around human habitations; the infection can be maintained in this way as ‘urban’ yellow fever.\n-from infected monkeys to humans by mosquitoes such as Haemagogus. This is ‘jungle’ yellow fever and is seen in Africa and South America.\n\nYellow fever is not transmitted directly from human to human by day-to-day contact, but transmission from ill patients to healthcare workers has been reported, notably after needlestick injury.']

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The results of phase 2 randomized controlled trials for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine demonstrating the efficacy and safety of four mAbs targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway [ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab) and TEV48125 (fremanezumab)] have been published recently, and phase 3 trials are in process.  Selective Inhibition of Trigeminovascular Neurons by Fremanezumab: A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody. Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab (formerly TEV-48125) is a monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a validated target for migraine preventive therapy.  Fremanezumab-A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody-Inhibits Thinly Myelinated (Aδ) But Not Unmyelinated (C) Meningeal Nociceptors.  As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine. We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons. To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats. Discussion Clinical data from phase II and III trials of the four monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway: Eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, collectively show a positive effect in the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine.  Background Fremanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is being investigated as a preventive treatment for migraine.

5abc9c1efcf4565872000020	How are deletion breakpoints defined?	Molecular mapping of deletion breakpoints on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we investigated the deletion breakpoints of the parkin mutations in 22 families with AR-JP and examined the possible association between these deletion events and meiotic recombinations. We identified 18 deletion breakpoints at the DNA nucleotide sequence level.  Hemizygotic deletions or duplications in the large Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD gene responsible for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are routinely identified using multiple ligation probe amplification and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Commonly used methods for the detection of CNV breakpoints include long-range PCR and primer walking, their success being limited by the deletion size, GC content and presence of DNA repeats. he hemizygous deletion of exons 45-50 in the DMD gene and the large autosomal heterozygous PARK2 deletion were used to demonstrate the workflow that relies on real-time quantitative PCR to narrow down the deletion region and Sanger sequencing for breakpoint confirmation.  Specifically, (AT)n, (GAA)n and (GAAA)n constitute the most frequent repeats at translocation breakpoints, whereas A-tracts occur preferentially at deletion breakpoints Using this approach, we have efficiently defined the proximal and distal breakpoints in two cytogenetic cases, one duplication and one deletion, to within 5-20 kb. The results support the potential use of BAC-based PCR fragments to further improve the resolution of the microarray-CGH strategy by an order of magnitude. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. In this investigation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing were used to isolate the deletion breakpoints, utilizing the newly available dog genome sequence. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. We used paralog-specific primers and long-range PCR to clone, sequence, and examine the distal deletion breakpoints from two patients with de novo deletions mapping to these distal LCRs. To define the Thailand deletion breakpoints, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the normal-sequence DNA fragments across the breakpoints.

Similarities between the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Nuclear Protein EBNA1 and the Pioneer Transcription Factor FoxA: Is EBNA1 a "Bookmarking" Oncoprotein that Alters the Host Cell Epigenotype? In this overview we focus, however, on the epigenetic alterations elicited by EBNA1 by drawing a parallel between EBNA1 and the FoxA family of pioneer transcription factors. Both EBNA1 and FoxA induce local DNA demethylation, nucleosome destabilization and bind to mitotic chromosomes.  In addition, EBNA1 and FoxA, when associated with mitotic chromatin may "bookmark" active genes and ensure their reactivation in postmitotic cells (epigenetic memory) about one-third of the FoxA bound sites are near silent genes, including genes without detectable RNA polymerase II. We found one such target site at a cryptic "shadow" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, where Rfx1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA Nuclear mobility and mitotic chromosome binding: similarities between pioneer transcription factor FoxA and linker histone H1 The results indicate that the "pioneer" features of FoxA factors involve various chromatin-binding parameters seen in linker histones and that distinguish the factors with respect to their regulatory and mechanistic functions. These discoveries followed the establishment of the conceptional framework of the mechanism of action of the FoxA proteins as 'pioneer factors' that can engage chromatin before other transcription factors. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the literature on three highly potent transcriptional activators: the herpes virus protein, VP16; the master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, MyoD and the "pioneer" factor for hepatogenesis, FoxA. Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA We find that slower nuclear mobility correlates with high nonspecific nucleosome binding, and point mutations that disrupt nonspecific binding markedly increase nuclear mobility. FoxA's distinct nuclear mobility is consistent with its pioneer activity in chromatin The Fox DNA-binding domain structurally resembles linker histone and binds nucleosomes stably Insight into the unique molecular basis of Foxa function has been obtained from recent genetic and genomic data, which identify the Foxa proteins as 'pioneer factors' whose binding to promoters and enhancers enable chromatin access for other tissue-specific transcription factors Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA. FOXO proteins represent a hybrid subclass having dual roles as pioneering factors and transcription factors. A subset of FOX proteins interacts with condensed mitotic chromatin and may function as &apos;bookmarking&apos; agents to maintain transcriptional competence at specific genomic sites.

Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Discovery of AG-120 (Ivosidenib): A First-in-Class Mutant IDH1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of IDH1 Mutant Cancers. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo.

Here, we employ ultraconserved elements (UCEs) designed for beetles and a novel partitioning strategy of loci to help resolve phylogenetic relationships within the radiation of Australasian smurf-weevils (Eupholini).

We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group. For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs. We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns. Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci.

53173fc5b166e2b806000006	What is the Timothy syndrome?	A point mutation in the gene encoding Ca(V)1.2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). o circumvent this issue, we have developed a method using human-induced pluripotent stem cells to generate cardiomyocytes from individuals with Timothy syndrome (TS), a genetic disorder characterized by QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and autism. Two de novo point mutations of Ca(v)1.2 glycine residues, G406R and G402S, cause a rare multisystem disorder called Timothy syndrome (TS). Here, we discuss recent work on the mechanisms by which Ca(v)1.2 channels bearing TS mutations display slowed inactivation that leads to increased Ca(2+) influx, prolonging the cardiac AP and promoting lethal arrhythmias Timothy syndrome is a human genetic disorder due to mutations in the Ca(V)1.2 gene. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the CaV1.2 channel (CaV1.2-TS) that decreases inactivation of the channel, which increases Ca(2+) influx, prolongs APs, and causes lethal arrhythmias.  Recent reports suggest that parental mosaicism is involved in the heritability of type 1 Timothy syndrome (TS1), an extremely rare and life-threatening multisystem disorder characterized by severe QT interval prolongation, syndactyly, and several other complications.  Timothy syndrome, long QT syndrome type 8, is highly malignant with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare long-QT syndrome caused by CACNA1C mutations G406R in exon 8A (TS1) and G402S/G406R in exon 8 (TS2). Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism. Long QT, syndactyly, joint contractures, stroke and novel CACNA1C mutation: expanding the spectrum of Timothy syndrome. Timothy syndrome (TS) is an autosomal dominant condition with the constellation of features including prolonged QT interval, hand and foot abnormalities, and mental retardation or autism. Timothy syndrome type 1 (TS-1) is a rare disorder that affects multiple organ systems and has a high incidence of sudden death due to profound QT prolongation and resultant ventricular arrhythmias. In some rare cases, such as Timothy syndrome (TS), a specific mutation in a single gene can be sufficient to generate autism or ASD in most patients, potentially offering insights into the etiology of autism in general. Both variants of TS (the milder TS1 and the more severe TS2) arise from missense mutations in alternatively spliced exons that cause the same G406R replacement in the Ca(V)1.2 L-type calcium channel. A gain-of-function G406R mutation in a cytoplasmic loop of Ca(V)1.2 channels causes long QT syndrome 8 (LQT8), a disease also known as Timothy syndrome.  A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome. Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by cardiac, hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features. The two forms are type 1 (classic) and type 2, a rare form caused by mutations in a transcript variant of the same gene. Cardiac findings include a rate-corrected QT interval of between 480 ms and 700 ms and congenital heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Hand/foot findings are unilateral or bilateral cutaneous syndactyly variably involving fingers two (index), three (middle), four (ring), and five (little) and bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of toes two and three. Facial findings include flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, thin upper lip, and round face. Neuropsychiatric involvement includes global developmental delays and autism spectrum disorders. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is the leading cause of death, followed by infection and complications of intractable hypoglycemia. Average age of death is 2.5 years.  The gain-of-function mutations were found at two mutually exclusive exons in patients with Timothy syndrome (TS). These patients exhibit prolonged QT interval and lethal cardiac arrhythmias. TS patients also suffer from multi-organ dysfunction that includes neurological disorder such as autism and mental retardation reflecting the wide tissue distribution of CaV1.2 channel. Unexpectedly, TS patients may develop recurrent infections and bronchitis that suggests a role of CaV1.2 channel in the immune system. Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease of excessive cellular Ca(2+) entry and life-threatening arrhythmias caused by a mutation in the primary cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.2). The TS mutation causes loss of normal voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 current (I(Ca)). During cellular Ca(2+) overload, the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias.  Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with the mutation of a Gly residue (G402 or G406) in the Ca(v)1.2 Ca(2+) channel. G406 is localized at the end of the IS6 segment and just before the intracellular I-II loop, which is important for the regulation of channel inactivation and the binding of the Ca(v)beta subunit. Inactivation of Ca2+ channel activity is perturbed in a rare yet devastating disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS), whose features include autism or autism spectrum disorder along with severe cardiac arrhythmia and developmental abnormalities. Most cases of TS arise from a sporadic single nucleotide change that generates a mutation (G406R) in the pore-forming subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel Ca(V)1.2. Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with QT interval prolongation and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. The syndrome has been linked to mutations in Ca(V)1.2 resulting in gain of function of the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)).

5abc9157fcf456587200001e	What is "enhancer hijacking"?	Pan-cancer analysis of somatic copy-number alterations implicates IRS4 and IGF2 in enhancer hijacking. Here we present a framework for inferring cancer-related gene overexpression resulting from CRE reorganization (e.g., enhancer hijacking) by integrating SCNAs, gene expression data and information on topologically associating domains (TADs). We additionally pursued cancer-type-specific analyses and uncovered IGF2 as a target for enhancer hijacking in colorectal cancer.  New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate PRDM6.  Importantly, such variants could affect enhancer regulation by changing transcription factor bindings or enhancer hijacking, and in turn, make an essential contribution to disease progression. We demonstrate a novel approach for simultaneous detection of genomic rearrangements and enhancer activity in tumor biopsies. We identify novel mechanisms of enhancer-driven regulation of the oncogenes MYC and BCL6, and show that the BCL6 locus can serve as an enhancer donor in an "enhancer hijacking" translocation.	['Enhancer hijacking is the molecular process through which a structural variant removes or moves a TAD boundary to expose TSSs to regulatory enhancers from which they would normally be insulated.']

Food intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. There is a great interest in the role of a major dietary protein, gluten, in the production of symptoms several published studies have consistently shown the efficacy of a gluten-free diet in rapidly controlling esophageal symptoms and in preventing their recurrence Since the participation of gluten in the esophageal symptoms of CD seems clear, its intimate mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, and several hypothesis have been proposed, including the specific immune alterations characterizing CD, the reduction in nutrient absorption determining the arrival of intact gluten to distal gastrointestinal segments, and various dysregulations in the function of gastrointestinal hormones and peptides. Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD). : At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001). Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.0%)  GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population. Effect of gluten-free diet on preventing recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related symptoms in adult celiac patients with nonerosive reflux disease. The present study is the first to have evaluated the effect of a GFD in the nonerosive form of GERD in CD patients, by means of clinical long-term follow-up, suggesting that GFD could be a useful approach in reducing GERD symptoms and in the prevention of recurrence. Altogether, 0.9% of patients with oesophagitis and 0.6% of those with oesophageal reflux symptoms had coeliac disease.  The prevalence of oesophagitis was 5.2% in untreated coeliac disease, 5.6% in treated coeliac disease, In coeliac patients, the reflux symptoms were mild but nevertheless were alleviated on a gluten-free diet. The association between these two conditions is, at most, weak, but a gluten-free diet may still bring symptomatic relief for reflux symptoms in coeliac disease	['GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.\nFood intolerance is a common complaint amongst patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), including those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease.

58ca746d02b8c6095300002d	Which cells express CIDEC protein in humans?	The expression levels of related adipocyte markers (PPARγ, C/EBPα), mature white adipose tissue specific markers (Cidec, RIP140) increased at the presence of NPY (10(-7), 10(-9), 10(-11) mol/L). The cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c (CIDEC; also known in rodents as FSP27 or fat-specific protein 27) is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes intracellular triglyceride (TAG) storage. CIDEC/Fsp27 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, but undetectable in normal liver. However, its hepatic expression rises during fasting or under genetic or diet-induced hepatosteatosis in both mice and patients.   Our results also suggest that patients taking fibrates likely have elevated levels of hepatic CIDEC, which may limit the efficient mobilization and catabolism of hepatic TAGs. Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation. We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. Hepatic CIDEC mRNA expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality. Hepatic expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly up-regulated in mice following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this up-regulation contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage. FSP27 [cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) in humans] is a protein associated with lipid droplets that downregulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rate when it is overexpressed. Fsp27/CIDEC is a CREB target gene induced during early fasting in liver and regulated by FA oxidation rate. Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference. Our data indicate that there is a kinetic mechanism of autoregulation between short- and long-term fasting, by which free FAs delivered to the liver during early fasting are accumulated/exported by FSP27/CIDEC, whereas over longer periods of fasting, they are degraded in the mitochondria through the carnitine palmitoyl transferase system. However, in adipose tissue the changes in Cidec mRNA did not correspond to the changes in Cidec protein levels, as a HFD decreased Cidec protein abundance. Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) protein, also known as fat specific protein 27 (Fsp27), is localized to lipid droplets. We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. Interestingly, in adipose tissue Cidea protein expression was significantly related to body weight (R=.725), epididymal adipose tissue (EWAT) mass (R=.475) and insulin resistance (R=.706), whereas Cidec protein expression was inversely related to body weight (R=-.787), EWAT mass (R=-.706), and insulin resistance (R=-.679). Similar to adipose tissue, Cidea protein expression in liver was significantly related to body weight (R=.660), EWAT mass (R=.468), and insulin resistance (R=.599); however, unlike adipose tissue, Cidec protein levels in liver were not related to body weight or EWAT mass and only moderately associated with insulin resistance (R=-.422, P=0.051). The CIDEC protein is located in lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is induced in fat deposition. CIDEC protein is required for unilocular lipid droplet formation and optimal energy storage in addition to controlling lipid metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference. The hepatic expression of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector family (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) genes is markedly upregulated in mouse models of obesity. After the differentiation of adipocyte, the expression pattern of Cidec was similar to that of PPARgamma2. This paper examined the tissue expression profile of CIDEC gene in cattle using real-time RT-PCR to suggest that bovine CIDEC is highly expressed in adipose tissue. Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family These results suggest that insulin regulates CIDEA and CIDEC expression via PI3K, and it regulates expression of each protein via Akt1/2- and JNK2-dependent pathways, respectively, in human adipocytes. Differential regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC expression by insulin via Akt1/2- and JNK2-dependent pathways in human adipocytes. Differential roles of CIDEA and CIDEC in insulin-induced anti-apoptosis and lipid droplet formation in human adipocytes. Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family.  Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation.  Using human primary pre-adipocytes, we confirmed that the expression of CIDEC was elevated during the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, and knockdown of CIDEC in human primary pre-adipocytes resulted in differentiation defects.  Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) is a lipid droplet-coating protein that promotes triglyceride accumulation and inhibits lipolysis. The cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c (CIDEC; also known in rodents as FSP27 or fat-specific protein 27) is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes intracellular triglyceride (TAG) storage. Here we demonstrate that knockdown of the lipid droplet protein FSP27 (a.k.a. CIDEC) in human adipocytes increases expression of ATGL at the level of transcription, whereas overexpression of FSP27 has the opposite effect. However, the transcriptional regulation of Cidec in adipocyte remains unknown. Moreover, the hepatic expression of CIDEC is downregulated by marked weight loss. These data demonstrate that, consistent with previous studies conducted in rodents, hepatic expression of CIDEA and CIDEC, but not CIDEB, is increased in obese humans. Transcriptional activation of Cidec by PPARgamma2 in adipocyte. Our data indicated additional fatty acids stimulated hepatic CIDEC expression and an increasing level of CIDEC induced hepatic LD fusion and lipid accumulation. We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. By analysis of CIDEC expression in 65 human tissues, we conclude that human CIDEC is predominantly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes. CIDEC/Fsp27 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, but undetectable in normal liver. Interestingly, FSP27/CIEDC was expressed in mouse and human livers and was upregulated in obese C57BL/6J mice. However, in adipose tissue the changes in Cidec mRNA did not correspond to the changes in Cidec protein levels, as a HFD decreased Cidec protein abundance.

532f05a5d6d3ac6a34000025	What is the effect of ranolazine in diastolic heart failure?	Data from in vitro and animal studies indicate that ranolazine improves diastolic function by inhibiting the late sodium current.  Ranolazine is an innovative anti-ischemic and antianginal agent that inhibits the late Na current, thereby reducing the Na-dependent Ca-overload, which improves diastolic tone and oxygen handling during myocardial ischemia. In addition, ranolazine seems to exert beneficial effects on diastolic cardiac function.  Ranolazine improves cardiac diastolic dysfunction through modulation of myofilament calcium sensitivity Diastolic dysfunction could be reversed by ranolazine, probably resulting from a direct effect on myofilaments, indicating that cardiac oxidative stress may mediate diastolic dysfunction through altering the contractile apparatus. Ranolazine (10 microM) significantly reduced the PC-induced increase in LVEDP by 72 +/- 6% (n = 6, p < 0.001), reduced left ventricular wall stiffness, and attenuated the PC-induced increase of CPP by 53 +/- 10% (n = 6-7, p < 0.05).   Ranolazine, a specific inhibitor of late INa, reduces Na influx and hence ameliorates disturbed Na and Ca homeostasis. New clinical and experimental studies even point to potential antiarrhythmic effects, beneficial effects in diastolic heart failure, and under hyperglycemic conditions.

55031406e9bde69634000021	What is the risk in G-CSF treatment for severe congenital neutropenia?	We obtained serial hematopoietic samples from an SCN patient who developed AML 17 years after the initiation of G-CSF treatment. Next- generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations during disease progression. In the AML phase, we found 12 acquired nonsynonymous mutations. Three of these, in CSF3R, LLGL2, and ZC3H18, co-occurred in a subpopulation of progenitor cells already in the early SCN phase. This population expanded over time, whereas clones harboring only CSF3R mutations disappeared from the BM. The other 9 mutations were only apparent in the AML cells and affected known AML-associated genes (RUNX1 and ASXL1) and chromatin remodelers (SUZ12 and EP300). In addition, a novel CSF3R mutation that conferred autonomous proliferation to myeloid progenitors was found. We conclude that progression from SCN to AML is a multistep process, with distinct mutations arising early during the SCN phase and others later in AML development. The sequential gain of 2 CSF3R mutations implicates abnormal G-CSF signaling as a driver of leukemic transformation in this case of SCN This chapter focuses on cyclic and congenital neutropenia, two very interesting and rare hematological conditions causing severe chronic neutropenia. Both disorders respond well to treatment with the myeloid growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) Treatment with G-CSF is usually effective, but the dose of G-CSF required to normalize blood neutrophils varies greatly. Ten to thirty percent of severe congenital neutropenia patients evolve to develop acute myeloid leukemia, necessitating careful clinical monitoring. In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), long-term therapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has reduced mortality from sepsis, revealing an underlying predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of infections, but its possible influence on the risk of malignancy is not known No septic deaths occurred during G-CSF therapy. Thirteen cases of MDS/AL were recorded. The cumulative incidence of MDS/AL was 2.7% (SD 1.3%) at 10 years and 8.1% (SD 2.7%) at 20 years Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup Stable long-term risk of leukaemia in patients with severe congenital neutropenia maintained on G-CSF therapy. This specifically applies to children with severe congenital neutropenia who receive lifelong treatment with G-CSF and in which the high susceptibility to develop MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has now become a major clinical concern. Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment	['Severe congenital neutropenia is a rare hematological condition causing severe chronic neutropenia.

58a5723c60087bc10a00001e	What is the benserazide's mechanism of function when co-administered with L-DOPA in patients with Parkinson's Disease?	Recent human and animal biochemical investigations clearly confirm and extend previous findings indicating that benserazide is much more potent than carbidopa as peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or carbidopa constitutes the best available therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). To reduce peaks and rapid fluctuations of L-DOPA plasma levels (possibly responsible for peak-dose dyskinesias and end-of-dose deterioration) a slow-release formulation of L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or with benserazide plus catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors should be developed.  In an open label study 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease suffering from end-of-dose akinesia were switched from a treatment with a L-DOPA standard formulation to a combined therapy of L-DOPA standard in the morning and L-DOPA slow release (levodopa, benserazide, Madopar Depot) at the remaining single doses. In the present study, L-dopa and benserazide were loaded by poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (LBM), which can release levodopa and benserazide in a sustained manner in order to continuous stimulate dopaminergic receptors.

Protein interactions form a network whose structure drives cellular function and whose organization informs biological inquiry. Using high-throughput affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we identify interacting partners for 2,594 human proteins in HEK293T cells. The resulting network (BioPlex) contains 23,744 interactions among 7,668 proteins with 86% previously undocumented. BioPlex accurately depicts known complexes, attaining 80%-100% coverage for most CORUM complexes. The network readily subdivides into communities that correspond to complexes or clusters of functionally related proteins. More generally, network architecture reflects cellular localization, biological process, and molecular function, enabling functional characterization of thousands of proteins. Network structure also reveals associations among thousands of protein domains, suggesting a basis for examining structurally related proteins. Finally, BioPlex, in combination with other approaches, can be used to reveal interactions of biological or clinical significance.

They are involved in diverse processes including cytokinesis, apoptosis, infection, neurodegeneration and neoplasia.  eptins are a family of cytoskeletal GTP-binding proteins that assemble into membrane-associated hetero-oligomers and organize scaffolds for recruitment of cytosolic proteins or stabilization of membrane proteins. Septins have been implicated in a diverse range of cancers, including gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.  nidulans septins contain the highly conserved GTP binding and coiled-coil domains seen in other septins. The septins: roles in cytokinesis and other processes. The septins are a novel family of proteins that were first recognized in yeast as proteins associated with the neck filaments. Septin9 is involved in septin filament formation and cellular stability. Here, we review these findings and discuss emerging mechanisms by which septins promote cell asymmetry in fungi and animals.<CopyrightInformation>© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</C These observations together with conserved sequence motifs identify the septins as members of the GTPase superfamily. BACKGROUND: Septins belong to the GTPase superclass of proteins and have been functionally implicated in cytokinesis and the maintenance of cellular morphology. Septins are important components of the cytoskeleton that are highly conserved in eukaryotes and play major roles in cytokinesis, patterning, and many developmental processes. The septins also appear to be involved in various other aspects of the organization of the cell surface. Septins are a family of eukaryotic GTP binding proteins conserved from yeasts to humans. Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions, including cell division and morphogenesis. Septin proteins are conserved structural proteins that often demarcate regions of cell division. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that form filaments and higher-order structures on the cell cortex of eukaryotic cells and associate with actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks. Septins are guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding proteins involved in wide-ranging cellular processes including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, membrane remodelling and scaffolds, and with diverse binding partners Septins are a group of GTP-binding proteins that can organize into heteromeric complexes and then into large filaments.  Septins are a conserved family of GTPases that regulate important cellular processes such as cell wall integrity, and septation in fungi. Septins are a cytosolic GTP-binding protein family first characterized in yeast, but gaining increasing recognition as critical protagonists in higher eukaryotic cellular events. Mammalian septins have been associated with cytokinesis and exocytosis, along with contributing to the development of neurological disorder Septins are a family of proteins that assemble a ring structure at the mother-daughter neck during vegetative growth, where they control cytokinesis.  Septins are a class of GTP-binding proteins conserved throughout many eukaryotes. Individual septin subunits associate with one another and assemble into heteromeric complexes that form filaments and higher-order structures in vivo.  The septins are a conserved family of GTP-binding, filament-forming proteins. I The septins are filament-forming, GTP-binding proteins that are conserved from yeast to humans. Septins assemble into higher-order structures such as rings, bars, and gauzes with diverse functions including serving as membrane diffusion barriers and scaffolds for cell signaling.  Septins are a family of 14 cytoskeletal proteins that dynamically form hetero-oligomers and organize membrane microdomains for protein complexes Septins are highly conserved and essential eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins that interact with the inner plasma membrane. They are involved in essential functions requiring cell membrane remodeling and compartmentalization, such as cell division and dendrite morphogenesis, and have been implicated in numerous diseases Septins are conserved GTP-binding proteins that assemble into heteromeric complexes that form filaments and higher-order structures in cells.

56cf413f3975bb303a000009	Is there a genetic component for happiness?	inally, a systematic review performed based on existing information. Results of studies on genetic factors indicated an average effectiveness of genetic about 35 -50 percent on happiness.  The MAOA gene predicts happiness in women. Although twin studies estimate that genetic factors account for 35-50% of the variance in human happiness, knowledge of specific genes is limited. This investigation examines association between happiness and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype.  Those with the syndrome have a predisposition toward apparent happiness and paroxysms of laughter, and this finding helps distinguish Angelman syndrome from other ones involving severe developmental handicap.  The heritability of happiness was estimated at 22% for males and 41% in females.  Biometric studies have shown that happiness is strongly affected by genes. The clustering of the four different measures (quality of life in general, satisfaction with life, quality of life at present, and subjective happiness) was explained by an underlying additive genetic factor and an underlying non-additive genetic factor.   happiness and the environment are influenced by genetic factors and family upbringing The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well.

NGS sequencing data for a particular genomic region can be seen as the summation of all the individual sequences (reads) obtained for that region and no longer as the mean of this sum as it is the case for traditional Sanger sequencing. Hereby we present the proof of principle of a NGS based mutation screening procedure allowing the detection of inherited Alu insertions within any predefined sequence by investigating 2 cases: c.1739_1740insAlu in BRCA1 and c.156_157insAlu in BRCA2. Targeted sequence data of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, generated using a PCR-based, multiplexed NGS approach using the SOLiD 4 (n = 24) and Ion Torrent PGM (n = 20) next-generation sequencers, The overall sensitivity for SOLiD and PGM were 97.8% (95% CI = 94.7 to 100.0) and 98.9% (95% CI = 96.8 to 100.0) respectively. The specificity for the SOLiD platform was high, at 100.0% (95% CI = 99.3 to 100.0). PGM correctly identified all 3 indels, but 68 false-positive indels were also called genes known to cause deafness sequenced by the Illumina NGS platform. Results demonstrated that targeted exons captured by our approach achieved specificity, multiplexicity, uniformity, and depth of coverage suitable for accurate sequencing applications by the NGS systems. Reliable genotype calls for various homozygous and heterozygous mutations were achieved. The method validated here could be readily expanded to include all-known deafness genes for applications such as genetic hearing screening in newborns applying this technology to von Willebrand disease 43 mutations, including 36 substitutions, 2 intronic splice site mutations, 2 indels, and 3 deletions. on the next-generation sequencing instrument, at least 350 patients and relatives per run can be simultaneously analyzed in a fast, inexpensive manner. The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by progressive spasticity in the lower limbs We used next-generation sequencing focused on the SPG30 chromosomal region on chromosome 2q37.3 We have shown that mutations in the KIF1A gene are responsible for SPG30 in two autosomal recessive HSP families. In published families, the nature of the KIF1A mutations seems to be of good predictor of the underlying phenotype and vice versa. Mutations in the COL4A5 gene cause X-linked ATS. Mutations in COL4A4 and COL4A3 genes have been reported in both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant ATS. To overcome these limitations, we designed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol enabling simultaneous detection of all possible variants in the three genes. We used a method coupling selective amplification to the 454 Roche DNA sequencing platform (Genome Sequencer junior). The Marfan (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz (LDS) syndromes are caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) genes, respectively. We have tailored a cost-effective and reliable mutation discovery strategy using multiplex PCR followed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) We conclude that multiplex PCR of all coding exons of FBN1 and TGFBR1/2 followed by NGS analysis and MLPA is a robust strategy for time- and cost-effective identification of mutations To date, six genes have been commonly associated with MKS (MKS1, TMEM67, TMEM216, CEP290, CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L).

55391825bc4f83e828000016	What are the effects of homozygosity of EDNRB mutations in addition to Hirschsprung disease?	Homozygous mutations of EDNRB in human have been reported to result in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease (WS4), while mutated heterozygotes manifested isolated Hirschsprung disease in lower penetrance The index patient, who was born to a family with no history of Hirschsprung disease, presented total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel extension, sensorineural hearing loss and generalized cutaneous pigmentary defects. Interestingly, both irides were normally black. The study detected a homozygous missense mutation at codon 196 in exon 2 (Ser196Asn), which has not been reported. Both parents and four in six siblings harbored heterozygous mutation without any clinical manifestation. Our findings were consistent with previous observations that full spectrum of WS4 occurred to the mutate homozygotes. Moreover, the non-penetrance of heterozygotes in our pedigree, which differs from other reports, demonstrates the high pleiotropic effect of EDNRB mutations in human. Our own studies could show that, whereas a homozygous mutation of EDNRB causes long-segment HSCR, a heterozygous EDNRB deficiency leads to alterations of the ENS resembling the histopathology observed in intestinal neuronal dysplasia ABCD syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut (Hirschsprung disease [HSCR]), and deafness. This phenotype clearly overlaps with the features of the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, comprising sensorineural deafness; hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and irides; and HSCR. Therefore, we screened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for mutations in the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, a gene known to be involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 (R201X) of the EDNRB gene was found. We therefore suggest that ABCD syndrome is not a separate entity, but an expression of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene. RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association.

51485a4dd24251bc0500002a	What is the mechanism of action of anticoagulant medication Dabigatran?	Dabigatran etexilate is a novel oral direct thrombin inhibitor, which provides stroke risk reduction for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.  Dabigatran is a potent reversible, competitive direct thrombin inhibitor which is available as the prodrug, Dabigatran etexilate. The recently introduced oral direct thrombin antagonist, dabigatran, has been shown in phase III clinical trials to be noninferior in efficacy to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as in treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. Dabigatran is an oral, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor approved in Europe and in several other countries for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective knee and hip replacement surgery.  Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor that inhibits both free and fibrin-bound thrombin. Direct inhibitors of FXa (rivaroxaban), FVIIa (BMS-593214), thrombin (dabigatran, argatroban) and FXIa (BMS-262084) were included for comparison.  Two agents, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, have recently been approved in the EU and several other countries for the prevention of VTE after total hip or knee replacement surgery.  The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is farthest along in development. Lastly, inhibitors of thrombin activity are composed of either indirect (UFH, LMWH), or direct thrombin (FIIa) inhibitors including: hirudin, argatroban, melagatran, ximelagatran, dabigatran, and bivalirudin. The effect of the oral direct activated factor X (factor Xa) inhibitor apixaban on tissue factor-induced thrombin generation in human plasma was investigated in vitro using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) method and compared with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. The DTI dabigatran etexilate was recently shown to provide superior risk reduction to warfarin for stroke and systemic embolism for patients with nonvalvular AF and recently gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication.

530b7ae4970c65fa6b00000b	what is the role of TGFbeta in cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury?	Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a crucial role in cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation while promoting myofibroblast phenotypic modulation and extracellular matrix deposition. We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor β signaling pathways. Direct examination of heart regeneration after mechanical or genetic ablation injuries indicated that these pathways are activated in regenerating cardiomyocytes and that they can be pharmacologically manipulated to inhibit or enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation during adult heart regeneration.  Transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenic protein and Wnt pathways interact to form a complex signaling network that is critical in regulating the fate choices of both stromal and tissue-specific resident stem cells (TSCs), determining whether functional regeneration or the formation of scar tissue follows an injury.  In the adult heart under pressure overload, Notch inhibited the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and transforming growth factor-β/connective tissue growth factor-mediated cardiac fibrosis. EMT and CSps formation is enhanced in the presence of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and drastically blocked by the type I TGFβ-receptor inhibitor SB431452, indicating that TGFβ-dependent EMT is essential for the formation of these niche-like 3D-multicellular clusters. Since TGFβ is activated in the myocardium in response to injury, our data suggest that CSps formation mimics an adaptive mechanism that could potentially be enhanced to increase in vivo or ex vivo regenerative potential of adult CPCs. During the proliferative phase of healing, infarct fibroblasts undergo myofibroblast transdifferentiation forming stress fibers and expressing contractile proteins (such as α-smooth muscle actin). Mechanical stress, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad3 signaling and alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix induce acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype.  Collectively, this data strongly suggests Wnt3a promotes the formation of a myofibroblast-like phenotype in cultured fibroblasts, in part, by upregulating TGF-β signaling through SMAD2 in a β-catenin-dependent mechanism. As myofibroblasts are critical regulators of wound healing responses, these findings may have important implications for our understanding of normal and aberrant injury and repair events. Conversely, exogenous addition of TGF-beta to the wound increased VIC activation, proliferation, wound closure rate, and stress fibers. Thus, wounding activates VICs, and TGF-beta signaling modulates VIC response to injury.	['TGFβ is activated in the myocardium in response to injury and plays a crucial role in cardiac repair by suppressing inflammation while promoting myofibroblast phenotypic modulation and extracellular matrix deposition. In fact, upregulation of TGF-beta signaling promotes the formation of a myofibroblast-like phenotype. TGF-beta interacts with bone morphogenic protein and Wnt pathways to form a complex signaling network that is critical in regulating the fate choices of both stromal and tissue-specific resident stem cells, determining whether functional regeneration or the formation of scar tissue follows an injury. In addition, TGF-beta enhances the formation of cardiospheres and could potentially enhance the regenerative potential of adult cardiac progenitor cells.']

5173a8b48ed59a060a00001d	What is the relationship between nucleosomes and exons?	Nucleosomes preferentially are located at the ends of exons, thus protecting splice junctions, with the N9 positions of guanines of the GT and AG junctions oriented toward the histones. Nucleosomes were found to be preferentially positioned within constitutive exons and/or constitutive portions of alternative exons, which was not associated with gene expression or states of cells but was based on sequence and positively related with the sequence conservation of splicing sites Here, we discuss the evidence supporting these ideas, from the first proposal of chromatin affecting alternative splicing, performed 20 years ago, to the latest findings including genome-wide evidence that nucleosomes are preferentially positioned in exons. Here we show, by analysis of data sets from human sperm and T cells and medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) blastulae, that internal exons of genes are characterized by sharply elevated average nucleosome occupancy in comparison to flanking intronic sequences. sing public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression. We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons of Caenorhabditis elegans. we have found stable nucleosome occupancy within human and Caenorhabditis elegans exons that is stronger in exons with weak splice sites. This confirms previously reported findings about preferential positioning of splice junctions within the nucleosomes.

About half of the patients with CdLS carry mutations in the NIPBL gene encoding the NIPBL protein, a subunit of the Cohesin loading complex.  Our data are the first to indicate a molecular and functional connection of NIPBL with chromatin-remodeling processes via the direct interaction with histone deacetylases. Cohesin regulates sister chromatid cohesion during the mitotic cell cycle with Nipped-B-Like (NIPBL) facilitating its loading and unloading Heterozygous mutations in the cohesin regulator NIPBL or cohesin structural components SMC1A and SMC3 result in the multisystem developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a developmental disorder caused by mutations in NIPBL, a protein which has functionally been associated with the cohesin complex The mechanism of this gene regulation remains unclear, but NIPBL and cohesin have been reported to affect long-range chromosomal interactions, both independently and through interactions with CTCF. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to investigate whether the disruption of NIPBL affects chromosome architecture. Cells carrying mutations predicted to have a more severe effect on NIPBL function show more extensive chromatin decompaction than those carrying milder mutations. The NIPBL protein is required for the loading of cohesin onto chromatin  In view of studies suggesting that Nipbl colocalizes with the mediator complex, which facilitates enhancer-promoter communication, we also examined zebrafish deficient for the Med12 Mediator subunit, and found they resembled Nipbl-deficient fish in both morphology and gene expression.

Therapeutic hypothermia is a recognized treatment for term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in reducing rate of death or neurodevelopmental disabilities. Little is known about applications of this treatment to preterm newborns. Randomised studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term or late preterm infants. We aimed to establish the feasibility and safety of mild hypothermia in preterm neonates with NEC and MODS as a prelude to a randomized trial.

56c331aa50c68dd416000005	What is the general function of H3K79 methylation?	Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking Dot1 exhibit a complete loss of H3K79 methylation and defects in heterochromatin-mediated silencing Furthermore, an acidic patch at the C terminus of Dot1 is required for histone H4 tail binding in vitro, histone H3K79 di- and trimethylation in vivo, and proper telomere silencing Recently, we demonstrated that in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization In human and mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization. Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin reorganization. Here, we report the cytological distribution of the evolutionarily conserved DOT1L methyltransferase and the different H3K79 methylation states resulting from its activity (mono-, di- and tri-methylation; H3K79me1, me2 and me3, respectively) during meiotic prophase I in mouse spermatocytes.  The heterochromatic centromeric regions and the sex body are enriched for H3K79me3 H3K79me patterns, combined with the cytological analysis of the H3.3, γH2AX, macroH2A and H2A.Z histone variants, are consistent with a differential role for these epigenetic marks in male mouse meiotic prophase I We propose that H3K79me2 is related to transcriptional reactivation on autosomes during pachynema, whereas H3K79me3 may contribute to the maintenance of repressive chromatin at centromeric regions and the sex body. We demonstrate that H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) is converted to monomethylation (H3K79me1) at HOX loci as hematopoietic cells mature, thus coinciding with a decrease in HOX gene expression H3K79 methylation: a new conserved mark that accompanies H4 hyperacetylation prior to histone-to-protamine transition in Drosophila and rat Here we show for the first time that H3K79 methylation is a conserved feature preceding the histone-to-protamine transition in Drosophila melanogaster and rat. The corresponding H3K79 methylation is a histone modification that precedes the histone-to-protamine transition and correlates with histone H4 hyperacetylation In rat, H3K79 methylation also correlates with H4 hyperacetylation but not with active RNA polymerase II, which might point towards a conserved function in chromatin remodeling during the histone-to-protamine transition in both Drosophila and rat. Methylation of histones H3 at positions K4 and K79 is involved in the initiation of recombination and the recombination checkpoint, respectively, during meiosis in the budding yeast.  We confirmed the role of Set1-dependent H3K4 methylation in the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in meiosis for the initiation of meiotic recombination, and we showed the involvement of Dot1 (H3K79 methylation) in DSB formation in the absence of Set1-dependent H3K4 methylation Together, our studies identified the evolutionarily conserved YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module and established a direct link between histone acetylation and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcription control. Here, we unveil the role of Dot1-dependent histone H3 methylation at lysine 79 (H3K79me) in this meiotic surveillance mechanism. Moreover, by genetically manipulating Dot1 catalytic activity, we find that the status of H3K79me modulates the meiotic checkpoint response. Methylation of H3K79 is associated with chromatin at expressed genes, though it is unclear if this histone modification is required for transcription of all genes. Thus, H3K79 methylation is not essential for transcription of Wnt-responsive or other intestinal genes, and intestinal toxicity is not imperative when DOT1L is rendered inactive in vivo. Whereas mono-, di- and trimethylation states of lysines on histones typically have specific functions, no specific functions have been attributed so far to the different methylation states of histone H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) generated by Dot1. Indeed, gene silencing in yeast, which is dependent on Dot1, relied on global H3K79 methylation levels and not on one specific methylation state. Furthermore, our findings suggest that histone H2B ubiquitination affects H3K79 trimethylation by enhancing synthesis of all H3K79 methylation states. Our results suggest that multiple methylation of H3K79 leads to a binary code, which is expected to limit the possibilities for regulation by putative demethylases or binding proteins. ChIP-chip analysis demonstrated histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methylation profiles that correlated with Mll-AF4-associated gene expression profiles in murine ALLs and in human MLL-rearranged leukemias To elucidate the mechanisms of genome reprogramming, we investigated histone H3 lysine 79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) and trimethylation (H3K79me3) in oocytes and preimplantation embryos via immunocytochemistry n somatic cells and oocytes, H3K79me2 was observed throughout the genome, whereas H3K79me3 was localized in the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in which there are no active genes. Because H3K79me2 is considered an active gene marker, H3K79 methylation seems to have differing functions depending on the number of methyl groups added on the same residues. Both H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 decreased soon after fertilization, and the hypomethylated state was maintained at interphase (before the blastocyst stage), except for a transient increase in H3K79me2 at mitosis (M phase) ChIP-chip tiling arrays revealed that levels of all degrees of genic H3K79 methylation correlate with mRNA abundance and dynamically respond to changes in gene activity. Conversion of H3K79 monomethylation into di- and trimethylation correlated with the transition from low- to high-level gene transcription. We also observed enrichment of H3K79 monomethylation at intergenic regions occupied by DNA-binding transcriptional activators. Our findings highlight several similarities between the patterning of H3K4 methylation and that of H3K79 methylation in mammalian chromatin, suggesting a widespread mechanism for parallel or sequential recruitment of DOT1L and MLL to genes in their normal "on" state. URA3 reporter assays also indicated that H3K79 methylation is required for HM silencing. Surprisingly, a genome-wide expression analysis of H3K79 methylation-defective mutants identified only a few telomeric genes, such as COS12 at TEL-VII-L, to be subject to H3K79 methylation-dependent natural silencing. Furthermore, H3K79 methylation by Dot1 did not play a role in the maintenance of natural HML silencing Since the discovery ∼10 years ago that Dot1 and its mammalian homolog, DOT1L (DOT1-Like), possess histone methyltransferase activity toward histone H3 Lys 79, great progress has been made in characterizing their enzymatic activities and the role of Dot1/DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, and the DNA damage response The histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase Dot1l has been implicated in the development of leukemias bearing translocations of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene Inhibition of histone H3K79 methylation selectively inhibits proliferation, self-renewal and metastatic potential of breast cancer H3K79 methylation directly precedes the histone-to-protamine transition in mammalian spermatids and is sensitive to bacterial infections in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization In human and mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin reorganization During spermiogenesis, haploid spermatids undergo extensive chromatin remodeling events in which histones are successively replaced by more basic protamines to generate highly compacted chromatin. Here we show for the first time that H3K79 methylation is a conserved feature preceding the histone-to-protamine transition in Drosophila melanogaster and rat When acetylation was inhibited in cultured Drosophila testes, nuclei were smaller and chromatin was compact, Gpp was little synthesized, H3K79 methylation was strongly reduced, and protamines were not synthesized Deficiency of H3K79 histone methyltransferase Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) inhibits cell proliferation Dot1-like protein (DOT1L) is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Mammalian DOT1L participates in the regulation of transcription, development, erythropoiesis, differentiation, and proliferation of normal cells H3K79 methylation is a critical histone modification that regulates cell proliferation and would be a novel histone mark for aging and cancer In rat, H3K79 methylation also correlates with H4 hyperacetylation but not with active RNA polymerase II, which might point towards a conserved function in chromatin remodeling during the histone-to-protamine transition in both Drosophila and rat	['ChIP-chip tiling arrays revealed that levels of all degrees of genic H3K79 methylation correlate with mRNA abundance and dynamically respond to changes in gene activity.

The fractal globule, a self-similar compact polymer conformation where the chain is spatially segregated on all length scales, has been proposed to result from a sudden polymer collapse. This state has gained renewed interest as one of the prime candidates for the non-entangled states of DNA molecules inside cell nuclei Additionally, the strings and binders switch model reproduces the recently proposed "fractal-globule" model, but only as one of many possible transient conformations The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10 Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009).

We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria Finally, ensemble analysis of the contact matrix, coupled with theoretical derivations and computational simulations, revealed that at the megabase scale Hi-C reveals features consistent with a fractal globule conformation At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus.

5508453a4b2a315d41000008	What is the biological role of SERCA2 SUMOylation in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology, such as in heart failure?	SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban, protein phosphatase 1, inhibitor-1, and PKCα. SERCA2 activity is also regulated by post-translational modifications including SUMOylation and acetylation. The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) can be conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins, and is involved in many cellular processes. Here we show that SERCA2a is SUMOylated at lysines 480 and 585 and that this SUMOylation is essential for preserving SERCA2a ATPase activity and stability in mouse and human cells. The levels of SUMO1 and the SUMOylation of SERCA2a itself were greatly reduced in failing hearts. Taken together, our data show that SUMOylation is a critical post-translational modification that regulates SERCA2a function, and provide a platform for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for heart failure. Recently, the impact of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO-1) on the regulation and preservation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) function was discovered. The amount of myocardial SUMO-1 is decreased in failing hearts, and its knockdown results in severe heart failure (HF) in mice. SUMO-1 gene transfer therefore improved cardiac function and stabilized LV volumes in a large-animal model of HF. These results support the critical role of SUMO-1 in SERCA2a function and underline the therapeutic potential of SUMO-1 for HF patients. However, the initial simple view of a PLN/SERCA regulatory complex has been modified by our recent identification of SUMO, S100 and the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein as regulators of SERCA activity.

Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to induce exon 51 skipping that is developed by Sarepta Therapeutics. Intravenous eteplirsen has received accelerated approval from the US FDA for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. The first AON (eteplirsen) has recently received accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration in the US. Currently, the most promising potential drugs are the exon-skipping agents eteplirsen and drisapersen. OBJECTIVE: In prior open-label studies, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, enabled dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 51. We also assessed the effect of dystrophin restoration on the expression of the five dystromirs in serum of DMD patients treated systemically for 12 weeks with antisense oligomer eteplirsen that induces skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin gene.  Exon skipping quantification by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients treated with the antisense oligomer eteplirsen. We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection.  To continue evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer designed to skip DMD exon 51 in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In prior open-label studies, eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, enabled dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 51. The present study used a double-blind placebo-controlled protocol to test eteplirsen's ability to induce dystrophin production and improve distance walked on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).DMD boys aged 7 to 13 years, with confirmed deletions correctable by skipping exon 51 and ability to walk 200 to 400 m on 6 MWT, were randomized to weekly intravenous infusions of 30 or 50 mg/kg/wk eteplirsen or placebo for 24 weeks (n = 4/group). Here we describe the development of a Taqman quantitative (q)RT-PCR assay to quantify exon skipping and highlight its use to determine the levels of exon skipping in DMD patients treated intramuscularly with a morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658). The subset of patients amenable to exon 51 skipping showed a more severe disease course than those amenable to any exon skipping.Over 3 years of follow-up, eteplirsen-treated patients showed a slower rate of decline in ambulation assessed by 6MWT compared to untreated matched HC.<CopyrightInformation>© 2016 The Authors.

52bf1d3c03868f1b0600000d	What symptoms characterize the Muenke syndrome?	Muenke syndrome is characterized by coronal craniosynostosis (bilateral more often than unilateral), hearing loss, developmental delay, and carpal and/or tarsal bone coalition. Tarsal coalition is a distinct feature of Muenke syndrome and has been reported since the initial description of the disorder in the 1990s.  Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3(P250R) mutation is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly identified with coronal suture synostosis, but it also presents with other craniofacial phenotypes that include mild to moderate midface hypoplasia.  Sensorineural hearing loss at lower frequencies was found only in patients with Muenke syndrome.   Sensorineural hearing loss can occur in all 4 syndromes studied but is the primary cause of hearing loss in children and young adults with Muenke syndrome. The facial features of children with FGFR3Pro250Arg mutation (Muenke syndrome) differ from those with the other eponymous craniosynostotic disorders. We documented midfacial growth and position of the forehead after fronto-orbital advancement (FOA) in patients with the FGFR3 mutation.  The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  Muenke syndrome is characterized by considerable phenotypic variability: features may include coronal synostosis (more often bilateral than unilateral); synostosis of other sutures, all sutures (pansynostosis), or no sutures; or macrocephaly. Bilateral coronal synostosis typically results in brachycephaly (broad skull), although turribrachycephaly (a "tower-shaped" skull) or a cloverleaf skull can be observed. Unilateral coronal synostosis results in anterior plagiocephaly (asymmetry of the skull and face). Other craniofacial findings typically include: ocular hypertelorism, ptosis or proptosis (usually mild), midface hypoplasia, temporal bossing, and a highly arched palate. Strabismus is common. Extracranial findings can include: hearing loss (in 33%-100% of affected individuals); developmental delay (~33%); intellectual disability; carpal bone and/or tarsal bone fusions; brachydactyly, broad toes, broad thumbs, and/or clinodactyly; and radiographic findings of thimble-like (short and broad) middle phalanges and/or cone-shaped epiphyses. Phenotypic variability is considerable even within the same family.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  A majority of the patients (95%) demonstrated a mild-to-moderate, low frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Increased digital markings were more severe posteriorly in Muenke patients than in non-Muenke patients. The Muenke patients with unilateral coronal synostosis showed a somewhat more severe asymmetry in the anterior part of the skull than the non-Muenke patients. Muenke syndrome is a genetically determined craniosynostosis that involves one or both coronal sutures. In some patients it is associated with skeletal abnormalities such as thimble-like middle phalanges, coned epiphysis, and/or neurological impairment, namely sensorineural hearing loss or mental retardation. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R)               ). The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Muenke syndrome and FGFR2-related isolated coronal synostosis are characterized only by uni- or bicoronal craniosynostosis; the remainder are characterized by bicoronal craniosynostosis or cloverleaf skull, distinctive facial features, and variable hand and foot findings. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal-dominant craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by unilateral or bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, hearing loss, intellectual disability, and relatively subtle limb findings such as carpal bone fusion and tarsal bone fusion.

A naked mtDNA molecule is longer than a typical mitochondrion and is therefore compacted in vivo to form a nucleoprotein complex, denoted the mitochondrial nucleoid. The packaging of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into DNA-protein assemblies called nucleoids provides an efficient segregating unit of mtDNA, Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is organized in nucleoids in complex with accessory proteins, proteins of mtDNA replication and gene expression machinery. The independent mitochondrial genetic information is organized in so-called mitochondrial nucleoids  packaging of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into protein-DNA assemblies called nucleoids confers higher-order organization to the mitochondrial genome. mitochondrial DNA is packaged into macromolecular assemblies called nucleoids, composed of one or more copies of mitochondrial DNA and associated proteins.  human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) had long been believed to be rather naked because mitochondria lack histone	['A naked mtDNA molecule is longer than a typical mitochondrion and is therefore compacted in vivo to form a nucleoprotein complex, denoted the mitochondrial nucleoid.']
51751ee48ed59a060a000025	How are thyroid hormones involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?	Diabetic animals developed low triiodothyronine syndrome. They also showed that diabetes during the final 8 weeks (i) caused a marked impairment in the performance of perfused hearts ex vivo of hypertensive rats but had no measurable effect in the normotensive WKY, (ii) had no effect on arterial pressure of either the normotensive or the hypertensive rats but reduced heart rate of hypertensive animals in vivo, and (iii) caused equivalent hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and hypothyroidism (depressed serum T3 and T4 levels) of hypertensive and normotensive rats. Treatment of diabetic RVH rats with T3 (10 micrograms.kg-1.day-1) in vivo was nearly as effective as insulin therapy (10 U.kg-1.day-1) in preventing the cardiac dysfunction ex vivo and was as effective as insulin therapy in preventing the bradycardia in vivo and the decline loss the diabetic state in rats is associated with lowered T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 levels Thyroid status of diabetic animals was normalized by T3 alone or in combination with myo-inositol but not by myo-inositol alone. T3 treatment alone did not prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. Untreated diabetic rats exhibited a decrease in spontaneous heart rate and myocardial cytochrome c concentrations concurrent with depressed plasma T3 values compared with untreated controls. T3 treatment did not improve in vitro cardiac performance (assessed as cardiac output times peak systolic pressure per gram dry heart weight) in hearts from diabetic rats perfused with glucose alone. Addition of octanoate reversed this depression and improved cardiac function to a greater extent in treated than in untreated diabetic animals. As triiodothyronine (T3) treatment has been shown to normalize depression of cardiac myosin ATPase in diabetic rats While diabetic rats treated with T3 alone did not show significant improvement of myocardial function when compared with untreated diabetics, the function of those treated with both T3 and methyl palmoxirate was not significantly different from that in control rat hearts Although the plasma level of thyroid hormone was decreased in the diabetic rat, thyroid hormone treatment did not restore microsomal calcium transport in the diabetic animals.

5150b45ad24251bc0500006f	What is known about the reimbursement of Viagra	Treatment with sildenafil was less costly and resulted in a greater gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with other treatments.  Based on this model, sildenafil is a cost-effective treatment for PAH with a low price and a net increase in QALYs. Four treatment strategies, Viagra, Rivastigmine, statins, and lung transplants, are analysed with respect to whether either cost-effectiveness or need, or both, seem to have played a role in the decisions it seems that decisions are almost exclusively made with reference to the principle of need. In Sweden  decisions on priority setting are almost solely based on the principle of need. This implies that the principle of cost-effectiveness is given very little space, which is a problem as this means an obvious risk of inefficient resource use. The case of Viagra, it concludes, holds out two general lessons: first, allow exceptions to total bans on reimbursement; second, involve the medical profession in the decision-making process. This paper analyzes the rationing strategies adopted in four countries (United States, Britain, Germany, and Sweden), the question whether statutory social health insurances are obliged to reimburse the costs for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  Coverage of sildenafil by health insurance plans is a contentious issue.  coverage of Viagra and Zyban was limited predominantly through generalized exclusion or through restrictions on quantity or duration of use. Value judgments, rather than cost, seem to play a central, though largely unspoken, role in these coverage decisions. availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US.  lthough the present study showed some variations between countries in selected indicators of availability and access to orphan drugs, virtually all of the drugs in question were available and accessible in our sample. However, substantial co-payments in the US and Canada represent important barriers to patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those analysed in this study. Adults with evidence of PAH from 1 January 2004 (commercial and Medicaid) or 1 July 2006 (Medicare Advantage) through 30 June 2008 were identified. Most patients (94%) initiated treatment with monotherapy (most commonly sildenafil or bosentan) Mean PAH-related healthcare costs were $6617 per patient per month, comprising 71% of all-cause costs. Retrospective claims database analysis of 706 patients with PAH enrolled in a large, geographically diverse US managed-care organization. Of the oral agents approved for treating PAH at the time of this study, sildenafil was most commonly prescribed as index therapy and was also associated with the lowest costs, largely due to significantly lower pharmacy costs. This study is characterized by limitations inherent to claims database analyses,  Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects approximately 30 million men in the United States. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the cost and utilization of sildenafil citrate (Viagra), an oral therapeutic agent for ED, in a large managed care organization (MCO) with a quantity limit of 6 units per 30-day supply and The total allowed charges for sildenafil pharmacy claims in 2001 were 3.56 million US dollars, of which patients paid 26.6% in average cost-share, and the net MCO cost per member per month (PMPM) was 0.18 US dollars. A total of 1,681 patients (8.3%) exceeded their quantity restrictions for sildenafil tablets in 2001, of which 1,362 (81.0%) paid cash and 319 (19.0%, or 1.6% of all sildenafil users) appealed and received approval from the MCO for additional sildenafil tablets beyond the restriction of 6 tablets per month A quantity limit of 6 tablets of sildenafil per 30-day period was associated with a drug cost to users and the MCO of 0.25 US dollars PMPM. Sildenafil users paid an average cost-share of 26.6%, resulting in a net drug cost of 0.18 US dollars PMPM to the MCO. Managed care companies are expected to counter runaway pharmacy costs for sildenafil by excluding it from coverage, imposing significant limitations, or requiring higher copayments.

5c73ad047c78d6947100008e	What is the mechanism of action of Inclisiran?	Inclisiran is a promising RNA-based therapy that promotes the degradation of PCSK9 mRNA transcripts and has similar efficacy to mAbs, but with a much longer duration of action. Recently marketed monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have shown the way towards innovation, while other ways of PCSK9 inhibition like small interfering RNA (Inclisiran) are already being tested.   Inclisiran, a novel, synthetic, siRNA molecule, inhibits PCSK9 synthesis in hepatocytes. Inclisiran targets intracellular PCSK9 synthesis specifically, resulting in a dose-dependent, long-term, significant reduction in LDL-C.  BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, inclisiran was the first agent composed of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to be preliminarily used to reduce proatherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol levels.  BACKGROUND: The ORION-1 trial (Trial to Evaluate the Effect of ALN-PCSSC Treatment on Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol [LDL-C]) demonstrated that inclisiran, an siRNA therapeutic that targets protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 mRNA within hepatocytes, produces significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. The development of inclisiran, siRNA silencer targeting PCSK9 gene, is a one step forward in these endeavors.  Inclisiran is a long-acting, synthetic siRNA directed against PCSK9 and it has been shown to significantly decrease hepatic production of PCSK9 and cause a marked reduction in LDL-C levels.  Inclisiran is a novel drug that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis specifically in the liver, harnessing the natural mechanism of RNAi. BACKGROUND Inclisiran (ALN-PCSsc) is a long-acting RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic agent that inhibits the synthesis of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a target for the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS Inclisiran produces significant and prolonged reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins, suggesting that inhibiting the synthesis of protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 through siRNA may be a viable alternative to other approaches that target protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Inclisiran targets intracellular PCSK9 synthesis specifically, resulting in a dose-dependent, long-term, significant reduction in LDL-C. Inclisiran has been well tolerated and safe, without severe adverse events so far. Areas covered: PCSK9 inhibition has emerged as a promising new therapeutic strategy to reduce LDL-C. Inclisiran, a novel, synthetic, siRNA molecule, inhibits PCSK9 synthesis in hepatocytes.

Topologically associating domains are ancient features that coincide with Metazoan clusters of extreme noncoding conservation clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Developmental genes in metazoan genomes are surrounded by dense clusters of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit unexplained extreme levels of sequence conservation, with many acting as developmental long-range enhancers. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci.

The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture.

589a245e78275d0c4a000029	Describe crowned dens syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Patients with crowned dens syndrome (CDS), which is pseudogout of the atlantoaxial junction induced by "crown-like" calcifications around the dens, present with symptoms of severe neck pain, rigidity, and high fever.  BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Crowned dens syndrome (CDS) is a rare form of calcium phosphate crystal depositions and often presents with recurrent neck pain, stiffness of neck, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and episodes of fever. A CT scan revealed calcification of the transverse ligament and crown-like calcification around the odontoid process. According to the clinical and radiological findings, she was diagnosed with crowned dens syndrome (CDS). Crystal deposition in the cervical spine around the odontoid process may lead to acute neck pain. This rare condition is called crowned dens syndrome and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a possible etiology for fever, headache and cervical pain of unknown origin.  Crowned dens syndrome (CDS), related to microcrystalline deposition in the periodontoid process, is the main cause of acute or chronic cervical pain. Axial calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPDD) is well known for cervical spine involvement with the crowned dens syndrome but other localisations are probably underdiagnosed in sterile spondylodiscitis.  We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features. FDG uptake in the immediate vicinity of the odontoid process, with a crownlike calcification, was identified on the CT scan on the posterior side of the dens, thus confirming the diagnosis of crowned dens syndrome. We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features Crowned dens syndrome (CDS), related to microcrystalline deposition in the periodontoid process, is the main cause of acute or chronic cervical pain.This report describes the case of an 87-year-old woman who had severe bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, gait disturbance and neck pain The crowned dens syndrome, related to microcrystalline deposition in the peri-odontoid articular and abarticular structures, is mainly responsible for acute or chronic cervical pain.We report eight cases of crowned dens syndrome with atypical presentations mimicking giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, meningitis or discitis The crowned dens syndrome as a cause of neck pain: clinical and computed tomography study in patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease Computed tomography of the cervical spine demonstrated linear calcific deposits in the transverse ligament of atlas (crowned dens syndrome) in all patients. Crystals located in the transverse ligament of the atlas give rise to the crowned dens syndrome, usually in patients affected by severe degenerative lesions of the atlantoaxial joint and peripheral chondrocalcinosis. BACKGROUND: Patients with crowned dens syndrome typically present with severe neck pain and have calcium deposits around the odontoid process of the axis on radiographs. We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features.

We sought to describe the natural history of this disorder, specifically its clinical presentation, disease course and long-term health status impact using the validated, disease-specific Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) OBJECT: The Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) is an established means of measuring quality of life, but the cognitive component of this questionnaire has never been formally compared with gold-standard neuropsychological test scores.  Patients completed lifestyle questionnaires, the hydrocephalus outcome questionnaire (HOQ) and underwent cognitive testing.  Measures of QOL were the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3.  METHODS: The families of children between 5 and 18 years of age with previously treated hydrocephalus at 3 Canadian pediatric neurosurgery centers completed measures of QOL: the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). In older children with hydrocephalus, the cHOQ appears to be a scientifically reliable means of assessing long-term outcome.  The HOQ is a simple and very useful measurement for determining outcome in pediatric hydrocephalus. The authors' aim was to quantify the QOL for children with hydrocephalus and identify predictors of long-term outcome, using a reliable and validated outcome measure: the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). OBJECTIVE: To compare three separate methods for establishing interpretability for a health status measure, the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). These include general outcome measures such as the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and the Functional Independence Measure for Children, which measure physical function and independence in chronically ill and disabled children as well as disease-specific measures for hydrocephalus (Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire), cerebral palsy (gross motor function and performance measures), head injury (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category and Children's Coma Scale), and oncology (Pediatric Cancer Quality-of-Life Inventory). An instrument to measure the health status in children with hydrocephalus: the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire.  The authors developed a quantitative health status measure, the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ), designed specifically for children with hydrocephalus, which can be completed by the children's parents.

In this study, we describe the genomic organization of the coding sequence of the human PCCB gene and the characterization of mutations causing PA in a total of 29 unrelated patients-21 from Spain and 8 from Latin America. The implementation of long-distance PCR has allowed us to amplify the regions encompassing the exon/intron boundaries and all the exons. The gene consists of 15 exons of 57-183 bp in size. All splice sites are consistent with the gt/ag rule. The availability of the intron sequences flanking each exon has provided the basis for implementation of screening for mutations in the PCCB gene. A total of 56/58 mutant chromosomes studied have been defined, with a total of 16 different mutations detected. The mutation spectrum includes one insertion/deletion, two insertions, 10 missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and two splicing defects.

5159502dd24251bc0500009b	The secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFPR3) is altered in human cancers. Are its level found to increase or to decrease?	We performed tissue microarray and found that the level of sFRP3 protein was high in normal kidney, low in primary renal cancer tissues, and high in metastatic renal cancer tissues. In conclusion, this is the first report to show that sFRP3 expression promotes cell growth, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis in renal cancer cells. secreted frizzled-related protein-3 were produced by multiple myeloma cells. these data suggest a tumor-suppressive potential for FRZB/sFRP3 in OGS. The ability of Frzb/secreted Frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3) to inhibit Wnt signaling and the localization of Frzb/sFRP3 on chromosome 2q to a region frequently deleted in cancers have led some investigators to hypothesize that Frzb/sFRP3 is a tumor suppressor gene. Together, these data suggest that Frzb/sFRP3 and DN-LRP5 exhibit antitumor activity through the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inhibition of MMP activities in a subset of prostate cancer. secreted frizzled related protein (hsFRP) was found to be down-regulated in some cancer. hsFRP is a potential tumor suppressor gene. All these cases were associated with either up-regulation of FzE3 or down-regulation of hsFRP Since modified Wnt signaling and down-regulation of frizzled-related proteins have been observed in many human cancers, this variant may also affect the susceptibility to other cancers.

56c1f00fef6e394741000040	Describe July Effect.	It is unclear, however, if this difference was related to climatological changes or inexperienced medical trainees (the July effect).   Given the nonteaching nature of these hospitals, the findings demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the summer are more likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than the July effect. BACKGROUND: Lower quality of care and poorer outcomes are suspected when new trainees (eg, residents) start in July in teaching hospitals, the so-called "the July effect." The "August" or "July effect" describes increased errors and reduced patient safety during this transition.  PURPOSE: Researchers have found mixed results about the risk to patient safety in July, when newly minted physicians enter U.S. hospitals to begin their clinical training, the so-called "July effect." INTRODUCTION: There has been concern of increased emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) during the months when new residents are orienting to their roles. This so-called "July Effect" has long been thought to increase LOS, and potentially contribute to hospital overcrowding and increased waiting time for patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The July effect is the hypothetical increase in morbidity and mortality thought to be associated with the influx of new (or newly promoted) trainees during the first portion of the academic year. Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect. Elderly hip fracture patients treated at teaching hospitals had 12% greater relative risk of mortality in July/August (ie, experience a "July effect") compared with nonteaching hospitals during that time period (1998-2003). Many have suggested that these new medical residents may produce errors and worsen patient outcomes-the so-called "July Effect;" however, we have found no U.S. evidence documenting this effect. A &quot;July effect&quot; of increased complications when new trainees begin residency has been reported widely by the media. The July Effect thus contributed to only a 2.4% higher FTOR in teaching hospitals compared to 19% in non teaching hospitals. The July Effect is reflective of an overall increase in morbidity in all hospitals at the beginning of the academic cycle and it had a pronounced effect in non-teaching hospitals. Studies of whether inpatient mortality in US teaching hospitals rises in July as a result of organizational disruption and relative inexperience of new physicians (July effect) find small and mixed results, perhaps because study populations primarily include low-risk inpatients whose mortality outcomes are unlikely to exhibit a July effect.

551af9106b348bb82c000002	What is the function of the MTH1 enzyme in cancer cells?	the glucose-responsive transcription factor Mth1 Human MTH1 (hMTH1) is an enzyme that hydrolyses several oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside monophosphates  We have recently shown that oncogenic RAS-induced DNA damage and attendant premature senescence can be prevented by overexpressing human MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), the major mammalian detoxifier of the oxidized DNA precursor, 8-oxo-dGTP.  Human Mut T Homolog 1 (MTH1): a roadblock for the tumor-suppressive effects of oncogenic RAS-induced ROS. MutT homolog 1 (oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase, MTH1), MTH1 cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP MTH1 hydrolyzes oxidized nucleotide triphosphates, thereby preventing them from being incorporated into DNA.  MutT-related proteins, including Escherichia coli MutT and the human MTH1 (NUDT1), degrade 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) to 8-oxo-dGMP and thereby prevent mutations caused by the misincorporation of 8-oxoguanine into DNA. MTH1 (or NUDT1) are also involved in the repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G), previous studies, To counteract such deleterious effects of nucleotide pool damage, mammalian cells possess MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) with oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase and related enzymes, thus minimizing the accumulation of oxidized bases in cellular DNA These results indicate that all three of the human MTH1, MTH2, and NUDT5 proteins act as a defense against the mutagenesis induced by oxidized dGTP. Human MTH1, an oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase, hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP thereby preventing its misincorporation into DNA.  MTH1 is a mammalian ortholog of Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to its monophosphate form in nucleotide pools, thereby preventing incorporation of the mutagenic substrate into DNA.  Several pathways are involved in the repair of DNA lesions caused by oxidative stress, such as the base excision repair system (BER), which repairs mutation involving 8-oxoguanine and comprises the MUTYH, OGG1 and MTH1 genes.  The MTH1 protein catalyzes hydrolysis of oxidatively damaged purine nucleotides including 8-hydroxy-dGTP to the monophosphates. The MTH1 protein seems to act as an important defense system against mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and cell death induced by oxidized purine nucleotides.  In mammalian cells, MTH1 and NUDT5 proteins degrade 8-oxoGTP and 8-oxoGDP to 8-oxoGMP, which is an unusable form for RNA synthesis. In a search for proteins functioning at the RNA level, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNP) protein has been suggested to be a good candidate for such a role. T Human MTH1 protein hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleotides 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), 2-OH-dATP or their ribo-forms to their monophosphates, thus minimizing replicational and transcriptional errors both in the nuclei and mitochondria. In human and rodent cells, MTH1, an oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase, efficiently hydrolyzes oxidized dGTP, GTP, dATP and ATP such as 2'-deoxy-8-oxoguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) and 2'-deoxy-2-hydroxyadenosine triphosphate (2-OH-dATP) in nucleotide pools, thus avoiding their incorporation into DNA or RNA.

Genomic aberrations and gene expression-defined subtypes in the large METABRIC patient cohort have been used to stratify and predict survival. Iteratively refining breast cancer intrinsic subtypes in the METABRIC dataset. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset Associations between genomic stratification of breast cancer and centrally reviewed tumour pathology in the METABRIC cohort. The integration of genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 2000 breast tumours from the METABRIC [Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium] cohort revealed ten subtypes, termed integrative clusters (IntClust/s), characterised by distinct genomic drivers.  RESULTS We show how this integration can be achieved automatically, following the declaration of appropriate metadata elements for each clinical data set; we demonstrate the practicality of this approach through application to experimental results and clinical data from five hospitals in the UK and Canada, undertaken as part of the METABRIC project (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium). We apply and evaluate the approach by integrating the five different clinical datasets of METABRIC. We had adopted a similar approach, termed 'BADGER', in the METABRIC project. METABRIC is a large breast cancer study that may have been the first in which eQTL-based detection of mismatches was used during the study, rather than after the event, to aid quality assurance. We conducted a cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analysis using normal or tumor breast transcriptome data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identified a total of 101 genes for 51 lead variants after combing the results of a meta-analysis of METABRIC and TCGA, and the results from GTEx at a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted p < 0.05. In UBC-TAM, NF1 frame-shift nonsense (FS/NS) mutations were also a poor outcome driver that was validated in METABRIC. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1·50, 95% CI 1·18-1·92, p=0·00010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1·68, 1·40-2·01, p<0·0001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1·68, 1·32-2·12, p<0·0001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1·62, 95% CI 1·03-2·53, p=0·036; METABRIC: 1·27, 1·02-1·58, p=0·034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2·34, 1·24-4·42, p=0·0090; and Nottingham-HES: 1·73, 1·23-2·46, p=0·0020). The new subtypes show accurate distributions of current clinical markers ER, PR and HER2, and survival curves in the METABRIC and ROCK data sets. The KMPlotter online tool, METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets were used to associate gene signatures with clinical outcome. Towards the development of robust strategies, we designed an iterative approach to consistently discriminate intrinsic subtypes and improve class prediction in the METABRIC dataset. METHODS The EarlyR prognostic score was developed using integrative analysis of microarray data sets and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-based quantitative real-time PCR assay and validated in Affymetrix data sets and METABRIC cohort using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Classification of the personalized landscapes derived from 997 tumour samples within the Metabric discovery dataset reveals a novel poor prognosis cluster, reproducible in the 995-sample validation dataset. To explore the contribution of cellular metabolism to cancer heterogeneity, we analyse the Metabric dataset, a landmark genomic and transcriptomic study of 2,000 individual breast tumours, in the context of the human genome-scale metabolic network. We assessed the RBsig prognostic role in the METABRIC and in a comprehensive breast cancer meta-dataset. We obtained information regarding TP53 mutation and PAM50 subtypes in 699 tumors from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort. METHODS We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). Using data from both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), we showed that rs62331150 was associated with level of expression of TET2 in breast normal and tumor tissue. Large research consortia such as the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genomics Consortium are systematically interrogating large sets of tumor samples through integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number and promoter methylation, transcriptome-wide RNA expression, protein expression and exome-wide sequencing. A recent METABRIC study explored the effects of cis-acting and trans-acting factors of gene expression regulation in breast cancer. Independent validation of prognostic interactions was achieved using data from the METABRIC study.

5710ed19a5ed216440000003	How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?	Protein phosphatase 1 recruitment by Rif1 regulates DNA replication origin firing by counteracting DDK activity Yeast Rif1 associates with telomeres and regulates their length. In contrast, human Rif1 did not accumulate at functional telomeres, but localized to dysfunctional telomeres and to telomeric DNA clusters in ALT cells, a pattern of telomere association typical of DNA-damage-response factors. After induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs), Rif1 formed foci that colocalized with other DNA-damage-response factors. These data reveal that human Rif1 contributes to the ATM-mediated protection against DNA damage and point to a remarkable difference in the primary function of this protein in yeast and mammals. Mammalian Rif1 contributes to replication stress survival and homology-directed repair. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to replication poisons Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR. Rif1 regulates the replication timing domains on the human genome  Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells Depletion of Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing domain structures Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Our results indicate that Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. mouse Rif1 as a key player in the regulation of DNA replication timin Mouse Rif1 is a key regulator of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells Rif1 deficiency in primary cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of replication Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive heterochromatin. Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication Rif1 is a global regulator of timing of replication origin firing in fission yeast We identified rif1Δ, a null mutant of rif1(+), a conserved telomere-binding factor, as an efficient bypass mutant of fission yeast hsk1 At the same time, many early-firing, efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1Δ Rif1 binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins activated in rif1Δ Rif1 is a critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast chromosomes. Rif1 as a global regulator of replication timing Rif1 which plays crucial roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells However, previous studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1's role in controlling replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its established role in telomere length regulation We have analyzed replication timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S. cerevisiae genome Rif1 regulates replication timing through a mechanism independent of this checkpoint. the Rif1 mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres. Rif1 controls DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 to reverse Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation of the MCM complex Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes. However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional characterization.  the first structural study of the mammalian Rif1, identifying a domain that directly links its function to DNA binding. The high specificity of Rif1 for cruciform structures is significant given the role of this key protein in regulating origin firing and DNA repair. RIF1: a novel regulatory factor for DNA replication and DNA damage response signaling. Rif1 is conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells. Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S phase checkpoint budding yeast Rif1 protein inhibits activation of prereplication complexes (pre-RCs). The Rif1 protein, originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, has recently been implicated in DNA replication control from yeast to metazoans Rif1 controls DNA replication timing in yeast through the PP1 phosphatase Glc7 Rif1 also interacts with Dbf4 in yeast two-hybrid assays, further implicating this protein in direct modulation of pre-RC activation through the DDK. Finally, we demonstrate Rif1 RVxF/SILK motif-dependent recruitment of Glc7 to telomeres and earlier replication of these regions in cells where the motifs are mutated. Our data thus link Rif1 to negative regulation of replication origin firing through recruitment of the Glc7 phosphatase. Rif1, originally identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing. Recent studies have identified factors that regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop structures.

51753a948ed59a060a000029	What is the role of AMPK in diabetic cardiomyopathy?	We recently reported that diabetes depresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, inhibits MAPK8/JNK1-BCL2 signaling Activation of AMPK directly phosphorylates MAPK8, which mediates BCL2 phosphorylation and subsequent BECN1-BCL2 dissociation, leading to restoration of cardiac autophagy, protection against cardiac apoptosis, and ultimately improvement in cardiac structure and function. studies were shown that p38 MAPK stimulates glucose uptake through the AMPK activation. Taken together, it is suggested that the modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart. Genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. Oxidative stress and lipid deposition were markedly increased in the myocardium, concomitant with inactivation of AMPK and increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Trimetazidine also caused AMPK activation and reduced PGC-1 alpha expression in the hearts of db/db mice. The data suggest that trimetazidine significantly improves cardiac function in db/db mice by attenuating lipotoxicity and improving the oxidation status of the heart. Activation of AMPK and decreased expression of PGC-1 alpha were involved in this process. Our findings highlight a role of PP2C and AMPK in the derangements of cardiac lipid metabolism in obesity and provide new insights as to the mechanisms of the liporegulatory disorder leading to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. We conclude that dissociation of BCL2 from BECN1 through activation of MAPK8-BCL2 signaling may be an important mechanism by which AMPK activation restores autophagy, protects against cardiac apoptosis, and prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy. Both the AMPK activator resveratrol and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine mimicked the UCF-101-induced beneficial effect in STZ-induced diabetic cardiomyocytes. UCF-101 protects against STZ-induced cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, possibly via an AMPK-associated mechanism.	['AMPK activation protects cardiac structure and function by increasing cardiac autophagy in the diabetic heart.  Decreased AMPK activity and the subsequent reduction in cardiac autophagy are central to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  In fact, dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis. In addition, genetic inhibition of AMPK in cardiomyocytes attenuates cardiac autophagy, exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases mortality in diabetic mice. The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy. Stimulation of AMPK by metformin or trimetazidine administration may represent a novel approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.']

Here we report that GDNF-family receptor α-like (GFRAL), an orphan member of the GFR-α family, is a high-affinity receptor for GDF15.

To promote membrane scission, dynamin proteins polymerize, wrap around, and constrict the membrane; however, the mechanism underlying their role in membrane fusion remains unclear.  Its role in endocytosis may be mediated by its reported interaction with dynamin 2, a 100 kDa GTPase that polymerizes around the necks of budding vesicles and catalyzes membrane scission Because the neck's radius is, in general, finite, membrane scission and the consequent pinching off of the vesicle can only occur if it is narrowed to permit the necessary membrane topological reformation.

52f892782059c6d71c000039	What is the association between number of pregnancies and rheumatoid arthritis	In this unique population, greater parity significantly reduced the odds of RA; an early age at first birth increased the odds, and the postpartum period was confirmed as high risk for RA onset. The protective effect of repeated exposure to the ameliorating hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy may counterbalance the effect of early exposure to the postpartum reversal of these changes. We found an inverse correlation between the number of pregnancies and age at onset of RA A larger number of pregnancies and late menopause show a protective effect, delaying the onset of the disease. Since the landmark study on rheumatoid arthritis, many reports have suggested that physiological changes during pregnancy often induce remission of systemic and cutaneous inflammatory diseases. Literature review shows that at best, there are weak negative associations between current estrogen use and RA, and no association with nulliparity and infertility. It appears that infertility, the number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome are not strongly associated with the risk of developing RA in women of childbearing age. However, in this study there may have been selection biases in the women with RA and the controls that differentially could have affected their reproductive outcomes. Thus, a true association could have been missed. Most other published studies find no association between nulliparity and RA. Number of pregnancies and children, however, were significantly higher in controls	['Greater parity significantly reduced the odds of RA.

We sought to develop a rational combination of motolimod-a novel Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist that stimulates robust innate immune responses in humans but diminished responses in mice-with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), a chemotherapeutic that induces immunogenic cell death.Experimental Design: We followed an integrative pharmacologic approach including healthy human volunteers, non-human primates, NSG-HIS ("humanized immune system") mice reconstituted with human CD34+ cells, and patients with cancer to test the effects of motolimod and to assess the combination of motolimod with PLD for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Results: The pharmacodynamic effects of motolimod monotherapy in NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in non-human primates and healthy human subjects, whereas the effects of the motolimod/PLD combination in tumor-bearing NSG-HIS mice closely mimicked those in patients with ovarian cancer treated in a phase Ib trial (NCT01294293). Motolimod (VTX-2337), a selective small-molecule agonist of TLR8, stimulates natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes. The activity of motolimod (VTX-2337), a potent and selective Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist, was therefore assessed in the context of advanced, late-stage cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS Late-stage cancer patients are highly sensitive to TLR8 activation by motolimod. Translational studies in cynomolgus monkeys elucidated the activity of motolimod on an intact immune system, identified biomarkers of TLR8 activation, and defined the relationship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) response. UNLABELLED VTX-2337 (USAN: motolimod) is a selective toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist, which is in clinical development as an immunotherapy for multiple oncology indications, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Motolimod, a selective TLR8 agonist can act in concert with approved immunotherapies to sensitize T cells and augment natural killer (NK) cell function.

Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom. Latest results from the UK trials evaluating prostate cancer screening and treatment: the CAP and ProtecT studies. The CAP and ProtecT trials (ISRCTN92187251 and ISRCTN20141217) will help resolve the prostate cancer screening debate, define the optimum treatment for localised disease and generate evidence to improve men's health. Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.  To date, the AIDIT team has established a website to facilitate communication between project collaborators (www.impact-study.co.uk), has been represented at several international meetings and has facilitated a conference for the IMPACT study to bring together international research teams, clinicians and policy makers.  This prospective questionnaire study was nested within the case-finding component of the ProtecT (prostate testing for cancer and treatment) feasibility study (ISRCTN20141297).  The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing this test.  To examine the pattern of use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in a UK region, where National Health Service policy does not recommend screening for prostate cancer.  In all, 165 862 PSA tests were performed on 84 669 men, and over a third of men aged > or = 50 years had at least one PSA test. Men aged < 50 years accounted for 12.9% of first tests. The proportion of tests from primary care increased from 47.2% in 1993 to 67.0% in 1999. The mean age of men tested once decreased from 65.6 to 61.9 years (P trend < 0.001) and the proportion with an elevated PSA level also declined during the period. Repeat testing increased with PSA level (P < 0.001) but 29.4% of men with a PSA level of < or = 4 ng/mL also had repeat testing. Raised PSA values were more common from hospital than primary care (32.4% vs 20.6%, P < 0.001) and in older men. Test rates varied 100-fold across general practices, a finding not explained by sociodemographic factors, but one which reflects differential adherence to national guidelines, suggesting that general practitioners are key targets for attempting to rationalise the use of the PSA test.  These findings suggest that PSA screening is taking place against evidence-based advice and has resulted in over 20 000 men being designated as having a raised PSA level, creating a need for further assessment. There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in the UK.  Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening test for prostate cancer. Some respondents were reluctant to give the leaflet to people enquiring about screening for prostate cancer, for example, because they thought that the leaflet would cause anxiety, or because prostate cancer screening was not freely available locally.  National guidance (executive letter) EL(97)12 stated that population screening should not be provided by the NHS, or be offered to the public until there is effective screening technology for prostate cancer.  This postal questionnaire survey reveals that 81% (95% CI 75% to 87%) of responding general practitioners in North Staffordshire agreed with EL(97)12 and one in ten said that the executive letter changed their views, suggesting that such national guidance has an effect.	['There is still no national screening programme established in the UK.

5322d9339b2d7acc7e000011	What are the main results of PRKAR1A Knockdown?	These results show that RIα inactivation leads to multiple, compartment-specific alterations of the cAMP/PKA pathway revealing new aspects of signaling dysregulation in tumorigenesis. Suppression of protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1 alpha (PRKAR1A) has been proven to inhibit cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell growth and enhance apoptosis. Silencing PRKAR1A expression induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of CCA cells, with an associated decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway signaling. The inhibition of PKA using a PKA inhibitor and cAMP analogs also led to a significant cell growth inhibition. abrogation of gene expression caused significant CCA cell growth inhibition, oncogenic signaling and coupled apoptosis induction Knockdown of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) Type Ialpha regulatory subunit in mouse oocytes disrupts meiotic arrest and results in meiotic spindle defects. These results demonstrate that RIalpha is required for regulating PKA activity in maturing oocytes and that compensatory upregulation of RII does not occur.

The seven immunologically distinct serotypes of BoNTs (A-G), each produced by various strains of Clostridium botulinum, act on the neuromuscular junction by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis.  Botulinum toxins, exotoxins of Clostridium botulinum, are the most toxic naturally occurring substances known to man. For more than a century they are known to be the cause of botulism, a nowadays rare intoxication with spoiled food that leads to generalized flaccid weakness of striated muscle including pharyngeal and respiratory musculature. The neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent acute toxins known and are the causative agents of the neuroparalytic disease botulism. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  BACKGROUND Botulism is a rare potentially fatal and treatable disorder caused by a bacteria-produced toxin that affects the presynaptic synaptic membrane resulting in a characteristic neuromuscular dysfunction. The toxin irreversibly blocks the release of acetylcholin from the motoric end plate which results in muscle weakness and paralysis.	['.

60321c531cb411341a000135	What is known about mammalian melatonin receptors?	activation of melatonin receptors (MT1, MT2, and MT3) highlighting their involvement in modulation of CNS, hypothalamic-hypophyseal-gonadal axis, cardiovascular, and immune functions. The melatonin receptor family is a small group of receptors within the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The group comprises of three subtypes which bind melatonin and one member, the melatonin related receptor (MRR), that shares >40% sequence identity with the other melatonin receptors but does not bind melatonin.  Its effects are mediated via high-affinity melatonin receptors, located on cells of the pituitary pars tuberalis (PT) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Two subtypes of mammalian melatonin receptors have been cloned and characterized, the MT1 (Mel(1a)) and the MT2 (Mel(1b)) melatonin receptor subtypes. Both subtypes are members of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family. Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 (genes officially named MTNR1A and MTNR1B, respectively) play crucial roles in melatonin-mediated regulation of circadian rhythms, the immune system, and control of reproduction in seasonally breeding animals.
