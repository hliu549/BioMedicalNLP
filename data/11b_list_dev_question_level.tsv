Previous studies showed that T-UCRs serve as novel oncogenes, or tumor suppressors are involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progressive. Nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and regulatory mechanism of T-UCRs in lung cancer (LC) remain largely unknown. We found that uc.454 was downregulated in both non-small-cell LC (NSCLC) tissues and LC cell lines, and the downregulated uc.454 is associated with tumor size and tumors with more advanced stages.

{"id": "5319abffb166e2b80600002f", "question": "Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?", "context": "Moreover, recent studies have shown that most EMT cases are regulated by soluble growth factors or cytokines. Among these factors, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) execute diverse functions by binding to and activating members of the FGF receptor (FGFR) family, including FGFR1-4.Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is an oncoprotein that is involved in tumorigenesis, and PD173074 is known to be a selective inhibitor of FGFR1.Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was also overexpressed in EMT cell lines compared with non-EMT cell lines.Furthermore, treatment of HOC313 cells with PD173074 suppressed cellular proliferation and invasion and reduced ERK1/2 and p38 activation.In addition, the expression levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), whose genes contain activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter sites, as well as Snail1 and Snail2 were reduced following PD173074 treatment.Taken together, these data suggest that PD173074 inhibits the MAPK pathway, which regulates the activity of AP-1 and induces MET.egulation of Na,K-ATPase \u03b21-subunit in TGF-\u03b22-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human retinal pigmented epithelial cellsThe EMT process is mediated via exposure to vitreous cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-\u03b22.Previous studies have shown that Na,K-ATPase is required for maintaining a normal polarized epithelial phenotype and that decreased Na,K-ATPase function and subunit levels are associated with TGF-\u03b21-mediated EMT in kidney cells.loss of Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 is a potential contributor to TGF-\u03b22-mediated EMT in RPE cells.MT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) is crucial for cancer cells to acquire invasive phenotypes. In A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, TGF-\u03b2 elicited EMT in Smad-dependent manner and TNF-\u03b1 accelerated this process, as confirmed by cell morphology, expression of EMT markers, capacity of gelatin lysis and cell invasion.Comprehensive expression analysis unraveled genes differentially regulated by TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and ECM (extracellular matrices), suggesting the drastic change in autocrine/paracrine signals as well as cell-to-ECM interactions. Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness.Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis.SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1.These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance.GF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitionThe cytokine TGF-\u03b2, which is expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, stands out as a master regulator of the pro-invasive tumor microenvironment. TGF-\u03b2 cooperates with stem cell pathways, such as Wnt and Ras signaling, to induce EMT. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 contributes to an EMT-permissive microenvironment by switching the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which thereby mount pro-invasive and pro-metastatic immune responses.In this review, we discuss the role of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT as a link between cancer and inflammation in the context of questions, which from our point of view are key to answer in order to understand the functionality of EMT in tumors.ranscription factors c-Myc and CDX2 mediate E-selectin ligand expression in colon cancer cells undergoing EGF/bFGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitionTreatment of HT29 and DLD-1 cells with EGF and/or basic FGF (bFGF) induced EMT and significantly increased sLe(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced E-selectin binding activity.Upon hypoxia, TGF\u03b2 addition or EGFRvIII expression, MCF7, A549 and NMuMG epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts. Expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin decreased, whereas mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin increased.The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression.Transforming growth factor-beta-induced tubular cell EMT in C1.1 cells was inhibited by MMP-2/9 inhibitor. Our in vitro study provides evidence that MMPs, specifically MMP-9, secreted by effector macrophages can induce tubular cell EMT and thereby contribute to renal fibrosis.nflammatory cytokines augments TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells by up-regulating TbetaR-IIn this study, we report that cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) significantly enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells as evidenced by acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of E-cadherin, and reorganization of F-actin.IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone can also augment TGF-beta1-induced EMT. However, a combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or the cytomix is more potent to induce EMT.These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with TGF-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.TGF-beta stimulated epithelial to mesenchyme transdifferentiation (EMT) in the presence of TGF-alpha, as characterized by increased expression of fibronectin and changes in TGF-beta receptor binding.EMT is typically induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and inhibited by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).Exposure of MDCK cells to 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 72 h induced EMT as evidenced by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of E-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin.In contrast, Akt1 down-regulation in IGF-IR-stimulated cells promoted dramatic neomorphic effects characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced cell migration induced by IGF-I or EGF stimulation. The phenotypic effects of Akt1 down-regulation were accompanied by enhanced extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation, which contributed to the induction of migration and EMT.ransforming growth factors beta (TGF-betas) inhibit growth of epithelial cells and induce differentiation changes, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Ha-Ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) to cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by spindle-like cell morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers.IGF-II induces rapid beta-catenin relocation to the nucleus during epithelium to mesenchyme transitionWe can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition;Based on the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during EMT.The NBT-II rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to FGF-1 and EGF, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) when cultured at subconfluency.EMT requires continuous TGFbeta receptor (TGFbeta-R) and oncogenic Ras signaling and is stabilized by autocrine TGFbeta productionEMT seems to be a close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between TGFbeta-R and Raf/MAPK signaling", "answers": {"answer_start": [131, 1443, 1058, 1747, 2309, 2716, 2798, 3046, 3625, 3736, 6059, 6660], "text": ["fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)", "TGF-\u03b21", "TGF-\u03b22", "TNF-\u03b1", "Sonic Hedgehog (SHh)", "Notch1", "GF-\u03b2", "Wnt", "EGF", "bFGF", "IGF-I", "IGF-II"]}}

Classification of low risk was based on an age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score <4 and the absence of high risk features, including known carotid disease, crescendo TIA, or atrial fibrillation. Our goal was to compare the very early predictive accuracy of the most relevant clinical scores [age, blood pressure, clinical features and duration of symptoms (ABCD) score, ABCD and diabetes (ABCD2) score, ABCD and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD2 and brain infarction on imaging score, ABCD and prior TIA within 1 week of the index event (ABCD3) score, California Risk Score, Essen Stroke Risk Score and Stroke Prognosis Instrument II] in consecutive transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients.

The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA.In this study, we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7, which is generated frequently in cancer.DNMT1 is a widely expressed DNA methyltransferase maintaining methylation patterns in development, and mediating transcriptional repression by direct binding to HDAC2.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of related proteins that both catalyze the de novo formation of 5-methylcytosine and maintain these methylation marks in cell-specific patterns in virtually all mitotic cells of the body.This methylation is critical for imprinting; a reduction in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 causes a widespread loss of imprinting.DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the key methyltransferase in DNA methylation regulations.DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that methylate DNA at the C5 position of cytosine residues, and their inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of various developmental and proliferative diseases, particularly cancers.DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferases.These results suggest that DNMT1 and DNMT3B regulate BAG-1 expression via insulator protein DNA-binding and chromatin dynamics by regulating histone dimethylation.Here we show that human miR-148 represses DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) gene expression through a region in its coding sequence.DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including the maintenance enzyme DNMT 1 and de novo methyltransferases DNMT 3a and DNMT 3b.Among the reported down-regulated miRNAs in lung cancer, the miRNA (miR)-29 family (29a, 29b, and 29c) has intriguing complementarities to the 3'-UTRs of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3A and -3B (de novo methyltransferases), two key enzymes involved in DNA methylation, that are frequently up-regulated in lung cancer and associated with poor prognosis.Furthermore, we have examined the roles of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and related protein (Dnmt3L) in this process.DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has been reported to interact with a wide variety of factors and to contain intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity.Inactivation of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, DNA methyltransferases essential for the initiation of de novo DNA methylation, abolished the establishment of DNA methylation and the silencing of Rhox cluster genes in the embryo proper.Rather, in vitro analysis indicates that Dnmt3L stimulates DNA methylation by both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b through direct binding to these proteins.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in promoter of the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene and risk for development and lymphatic metastasis of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA).Methylation at the 5-position of DNA cytosine on the vertebrate genomes is accomplished by the combined catalytic actions of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the de novo enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance enzyme DNMT1.There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance.Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B.", "answers": {"answer_start": [14, 556, 337], "text": ["DNMT1", "DNMT2", "DNMT3"]}}

Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 (95% of patients), pancreatic islet tumors or pancreatic NET (neuroendocrine tumor) occur in 40-70% and pituitary tumors in 30-40% of MEN 1 patients In addition, other tumors, such as adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, lipomas, angiofibromas, colagenomas and meningiomas may be present. the most important causes malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and thymic carcinoids. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predisposes to the development of hyperplastic or neoplastic changes in the parathyroid and pituitary glands and the endocrine pancreas, along with numerous other characteristic tumors and features. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of parathyroid and adrenocortical tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the pancreas and pituitary. The pancreatic NETs are predominantly gastrinomas and insulinomas, and the pituitary NETs are mostly prolactinomas and somatotrophinomas. We address the potential role of miRNAs in the endocrine pancreas, the pituitary gland, and the parathyroid glands-areas where MEN 1 shows high penetrance. Moreover, studies have provided evidence that dysregulation of miRNAs was responsible for endocrine carcinogenesis, including pancreatic, pituitary, and parathyroid tumors.MEN1 and MEN2 are rare inherited cancer syndromes which express a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine tumors.Multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome predisposing to tumor development in several endocrine organs. Its major manifestations include hyperparathyroidism, tumors of endocrine pancreas and pituitary. eside these three, several other endocrine (adrenocortical, foregut carcinoid) and nonendocrine (lipoma, angiofibroma, collagenoma, ependymoma, meningioma) tumors have been described to be associated with this syndromeBoth familial and sporadic forms of the disease are known. The diagnosis of MEN1 can be established if two of the three major manifestations are found in the same patient, whereas the diagnosis of familial MEN1 requires one MEN1 patient and a first degree relative with at least one MEN1 manifestation. Both benign (parathyroid, anterior pituitary) and malignant (gastrinoma, glucagonoma) lesions may develop in MEN1 patientsMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a classic hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by a genetic predisposition to develop a variety of neuroendocrine neoplasias and hormone excess syndromes.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a familial syndrome characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic and pituitary tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome characterized by the development of multiple endocrine tumorsMultiple facial angiofibromas were observed in 28 (88%) of the patients with MEN1, with 16 patients (50%) having 5 or more. Angiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis. Collagenomas were observed in 23 patients (72%). Also observed were cafe au lait macules in 12 patients (38%), lipomas in 11 patients (34%), confetti-like hypopigmented macules in 2 patients (6%), and multiple gingival papules in 2 patients (6%)Multiple angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, confetti-like hypopigmented macules and multiple gingival papules are cutaneous manifestations of MEN1 and should be looked for in both family members of patients with MEN1 and individuals with hyperparathyroidism of other MEN1-associated tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by nodular proliferation of the parathyroid glands and tumors of the anterior pituitary gland, the endocrine pancreas, and the neuroendocrine cell system of the gut.We report here a genetic study of a female MEN1 patient with the association of nodular hyperplasia of two parathyroid glands, an insulinoma, multiple duodenal gastrinomas, a prolactinoma, and a gastric carcinoid.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is defined clinically by the combined occurrence of multiple tumors, typically of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary gland.In support of previous findings in islet tumors, we found down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulator, p18, in both the pancreatic islet and pituitary adenomas, suggesting that reduced p18 levels may be important for Men1-related tumorigenesis in multiple tissues. Surprisingly, we identified increased p16 transcript in pancreatic islet and pituitary tumors.  The patient was studied and diagnosed with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), familiar (mother with MEN I). A scintigraphic study with 99mTc-MIBI was performed in order to localize hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands because of biochemical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The tumor was removed and histologically confirmed as a carcinoid within a thymus in a MEN type I syndrome. MEN I patients can benefit from the examination with this agent which can potentially localize not only parathyroid endocrine pathology but also unknown associated tumors.Pancreatic endocrine tumors occur sporadically and as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndromes. We have analyzed 22 nonfamilial and 16 MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p, 11q13, and 18q. LOH at 3p was revealed in 45% and 36% of tumors from 31 patients with nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated disease, respectively.The data indicate involvement of tumor suppressor genes on 3p and 18q, in addition to the MEN1 gene at 11q13, in the tumorigenesis of both nonfamilial and MEN 1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by the development of endocrine tumors of the parathyroid and pituitary glands, pancreas, and duodenum. Less frequently occurring tumors associated with MEN1 include non-endocrine tumors such as lipomas and angiofibromas. An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms, leiomyomas, adrenal cortical hyperplasia, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and renal angiomyolipoma has been noted in the MEN1 population. A germline mutation of the MEN1 gene was detected, and deletions of the MEN1 gene were consistently detected in multiple neuroendocrine tumors involving the parathyroid glands and the pancreas and a hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, as predicted by Knudson's \"two hit\" hypothesis.Two hits of the MEN1 gene were also detected in esophageal leiomyoma tissue, suggesting that tumorigenesis was directly related to the patient's underlying MEN1. In contrast, follicular thyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and adrenal cortical hyperplasia consistently showed retained heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene with flanking markers and an intragenic marker. Therefore, these tumors appear to develop along pathogenetic pathways that are different from classical MEN1-associated tumors.Twelve unrelated (German MEN1 families and their associated tumors (5 parathyroid tumors, 1 vipoma, 1 gastrinoma, 1 insulinoma) were characterized for MEN1 gene mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and DNA sequence analysis as well as for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11q13.

We identified 23 children,Adverse effects were noted in 6 children.To determine the effectiveness of gabapentin as an add-on therapy in children presenting with overactive bladder (OAB)Data were analyzed in 30 patients as treatment was terminated in 1 due to adverse effects.Gabapentin gives moderate results in children with OAB refractory to conventional anticholinergics. In general, the drug is well tolerated with fewer adverse effects.To describe a child who developed a skin reaction during gabapentin therapy and discuss how we evaluated the probability of an adverse drug reactionIn contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, skin reactions to gabapentin are considered uncommon. In adults, reported prevalence of rash possibly related to gabapentin range from 1% to 10%. A postmarketing surveillance study reported gabapentin treatment failure as a consequence of rash in 0.4% of 3000 patients. The product monograph does not mention rash in children.This case, and limited literature data, suggest that gabapentin may cause rash that is severe enough to necessitate discontinuation in a small percentage of children. Further research is needed to determine the actual incidence and severity of gabapentin-related rash in this population.Five patients treated in the Children's Hospital Pain Control Service for intractable neuropathic pain were included in gabapentin treatmentWe noticed a rapid improvement, in 1 week, of our patients' VAS scores (from 9 or 10 to 4 or 3) with minimal adverse effectsThe charts of all children given gabapentin for seizures were reviewed.Only 8 children (7%) reported adverse effects, and the drug was discontinued in two.A postmarketing surveillance study of gabapentin as add-on therapy for 3,100 patients in England.The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were children.The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs)Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and reported as suspected ADRs.We reviewed the reports in the literature on the safety, adverse effects and tolerance of GBP as treatment, used as monotherapy or associated with other drugs, in epilepsies in patients of all age groups, including children, adults and the elderlyGBP is a well tolerated drug when used for monotherapy or associated with other antiepileptic drugs. The commonest adverse effects seen were somnolence, fainting, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor and headache. However, their incidence was low and intensity mild. There was no clear relationship between the dose given and appearance of side effects, except for fainting and somnolence.GBP is a drug which is free of unwanted side effects. Its safety and tolerability profile is excellent for treatment of simple and complex partial crises, with or without generalization in epileptic patients of all ages.Two studies were conducted to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in healthy subjects age 1 month to 12 years and to guide dose selection in safety and efficacy trials in pediatric patientsSingle doses of gabapentin were well tolerated by healthy pediatric subjects.The efficacy and safety of gabapentin as add-on therapy for refractory partial seizures in 237 children, aged 3 to 12 years were evaluated over a 6-month period.Thirteen patients (5%) withdrew during the 6-month period because of adverse events.Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentinOf the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group.Twenty-six children with intellectual disability and six normal children, all suffering from refractory partial seizures, received open-label gabapentin (range = 10-50 mg kg(-1) day(-1); mean = 26.7 mg kg(-1) day(-1) as an add-on medication to their antiepileptic drug regimenIn the present patient population, patients younger than 10 years of age, all of whom had intellectual disability, were more likely to have side-effects than those older than 10 years of age. Observed adverse effects, which were generally mild, occurred in patients with baseline intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder and behavioural problems. Behavioural adverse effects warranted discontinuation of the medication in only three patients. The severity of intellectual disability (mild versus moderate or severe) did not affect the extent of the response or the occurrence of side-effects.However, children with intellectual disability who also are less than 10 years of age with baseline attention deficit appear to be at a higher risk of behavioural side-effects.Efficacy and safety of gabapentin monotherapy were evaluated in 33 children with newly diagnosed absence epilepsySomnolence and dizziness were the only adverse events reported by at least two patients during gabapentin treatment. No clinically important changes in laboratory assessments or other safety parameters were observed.Thirty-two children with refractory partial epilepsy received open-label gabapentin as an additional medication to their antiepileptic drug regimenThe major reported side effects were behavioral. These consisted of hyperactivity, irritability, and agitation that occurred in patients with baseline mental retardation with attention deficit.We report 2 children who received GBP for intractable seizures and who developed intolerable aggressive behavior requiring dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Behavioral changes should be recognized as a possible side effect of GBP, especially in mentally retarded children.We report 7 children who received gabapentin (GBP) as adjunctive medic ation and subsequently developed behavioral side effects. These behavioral changes consisted of intensification of baseline behaviors as well as new behavioral problems. Behaviors that parents considered most troublesome were tantrums, aggression directed toward others, hyperactivity, and defiance. All behavioral changes were reversible and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of GBP. All children had baseline attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental delays.We described 3 learning disabled children, 1 aged 7 and 2 aged 10 years, with intractable partial seizures who developed severe behavioral problems while receiving modest doses of GBP. The children became hyperactive and had explosive outburst consisting of aggressive and oppositional behavior.

Somatic mutations of epigenetic gene regulators are common in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and correlate with some clinical and laboratory features. Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75-80% of MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i.e. cytokine signaling (RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications (ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with mutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes.Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap.

Cultures of wild-type E. coli K12 and mutants for uvrA, uvrB, uvrC or uvrAC genes were treated with PUVA and cell survival was determined.Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is universally used to recognize and remove many types of DNA damage. In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase.During nucleotide excision repair (NER) in bacteria the UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase.UvrD interacts with UvrB, a component of the post-incision complex.PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex, which supports the idea that PcrA performs a UvrD-like function during NER in gram-positive organisms.Cho rather than UvrC seems to be an effective nuclease for the NER of DPCs.Nucleotide excision repair consists of excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner.Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain.we used a genetic approach to investigate the roles of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway components in H. pylori mutation and recombination. RESULTS: Inactivation of any of the four uvr genes strongly increased the susceptibility of H. pylori to DNA damage by ultraviolet light. Inactivation of uvrA and uvrB significantly decreased mutation frequencies whereas only the uvrA deficient mutant exhibited a significant decrease of the recombination frequency after natural transformation. A uvrC mutant did not show significant changes in mutation or recombination rates; however, inactivation of uvrC promoted the incorporation of significantly longer fragments of donor DNA (2.2-fold increase) into the recipient chromosome. A deletion of uvrD induced a hyper-recombinational phenotype.Transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that is triggered when RNA polymerase is stalled by DNA damage. Lesions targeted by TCR are repaired more quickly than lesions repaired by the transcription-independent \"global\" NER pathway, but the mechanism underlying this rate enhancement is not understood. Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Bacterial TCR additionally requires the Mfd protein, a DNA translocase that removes the stalled transcription complexes.", "answers": {"answer_start": [198, 204, 563, 478, 500], "text": ["UvrA", "UvrB", "UvrC nuclease", "DNA polymerase I", "Ligase"]}}

Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independent predictors of mortality in young adults with severe COVID-19.Lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hs-CTnI and hs-CRP predicted clinical outcomes of young adults with severe COVID-19.Compared to patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19, patients who had a severe form of disease revealed higher values for white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, troponin, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. By contrast, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and albumin levels were decreased in patients with a severe form of COVID-19.Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common.

Therefore, lower expression of keratinocyte-derived factors, including SCF, in vitiliginous keratinocytes, which could result from keratinocyte apoptosis, might be responsible for passive melanocyte death and may explain the Koebner phenomenon.Deprivation of survival factors causes the apoptosis of melanocytes. Vitiligo often develops following physical trauma, even if this is minor. The exact mechanism of the Koebner phenomenon in vitiligo is unclear.First described in 1877 as the appearance of psoriatic lesions in the uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients as a consequence of trauma, the Koebner phenomenon has since been described in numerous diseases. The Koebner phenomenon is known to occur (lichen sclerosus occurs in skin already scarred or damaged), so trauma, injury, and sexual abuse have been suggested as possible triggers of symptoms in genetically predisposed people. The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the \"deep Koebner\" phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis.

Since 1973, four proteins, Cdc6/Cdc18, MCM, ORC and Cdt1, have been extensively studied and proved to be pre-RC components. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively. In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1.The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC).

However, Notch-3 expression appeared to be increased in diseased tissue. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of NOTCH2 and its isoforms NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4 and the NOTCH2 primary ligand JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas.There are four different mammalian Notch receptors that can be activated by five cell surface ligandsThere are four mammalian Notch receptors that have only partially overlapping functions despite sharing similar structures and ligands.", "answers": {"answer_start": [1060, 1260], "text": ["Notch-1", "Notch-3"]}}

Only six patients have been described to date. All the previous mutations were truncating variants clustered in the C-terminus of the protein. A previous patient with TRIM8-related epileptic encephalopathy was reported to have nephrotic syndrome. Here we describe the clinical, radiological and histological features of an 8-year-old male patient with a TRIM8 mutation who, in contrast to previous patients, had only mild intellectual disability and well-controlled epilepsy. The patient was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age. Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His kidney function declined and peritoneal dialysis was started at 5 years of age. He underwent renal transplant at 7 years of age. Trio-based whole genome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912.2) c.1198_1220del, p.(Tyr400ArgfsTer2). This patient is further evidence that TRIM8 mutations cause a syndrome with both neurological and renal features.

We also show that papilloma virus E7 abolishes the p38-induced growth arrest but not other senescence-associated phenotypes, indicating the differential role of pRb in the downstream of p38.Expression of caveolin-1 induces premature cellular senescence in primary cultures of murine fibroblastsHere, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent phenotype.Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored.these results clearly indicate a central role for caveolin-1 in promoting cellular senescenceOncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway.In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence.our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms.Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population.The suppression of oncogenic levels of MYC is sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression associated with proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction.", "answers": {"answer_start": [913, 491, 1068, 1533, 1811, 2455, 3399, 4664, 5720], "text": ["Ras", "c-Abl", "Myc", "Skp2", "BRAF", "AKT", "HDAC2", "Caveolin-1", "Mek1"]}}

However, it is becoming evident that the effects of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by BRAF inhibitors in non-BRAF-mutant cells needs to be taken into account, which may be implicated in the problems encountered in the first clinical trial testing a combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), with significant liver toxicities.The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma.His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab.Thirty-one patients commenced dabrafenib therapy including six individuals who had progressed on a prior BRAF-inhibitor treatment.Population pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor: effect of dose, time, covariates, and relationship with its metabolites.Dabrafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma. This was a prospective study of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600 mutation and treated with iBRAF within a clinical trial (dabrafenib) or as part of an expanded access program (vemurafenib).We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases.This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma. Tumor genetic analyses of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).PURPOSE: Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF kinase, which recently showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with dacarbazine, in metastatic melanoma patients. Phase II trial (BREAK-2) of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436) in patients with metastatic melanoma.PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase.Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a concerning toxicity with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment for melanoma. While the two drugs shown to improve survival, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, have similar efficacy, the reported rates of cSCC are quite different.PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy. BACKGROUND: The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test is a CE-marked and FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic assay used to select patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenibThe purpose of this study is to review the development of BRAF inhibitors, with emphasis on the trials conducted with dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the evolving role of dabrafenib in treatment for melanoma patients.Dabrafenib inhibits the mutant BRAF (BRAF(mut)) protein in melanomas with BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) genotypes.To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor.Cutaneous manifestations of dabrafenib (GSK2118436): a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF in patients with metastatic melanoma.We conducted a systematic prospective dermatological review of all patients enrolled at a single institution in the phase I/II clinical trial of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy.Neoplastic leptomeningitis presenting in a melanoma patient treated with dabrafenib (a V600EBRAF inhibitor): a case report.For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy.BACKGROUND: The development of keratoacanthomas (KAs) and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is a known adverse effect of novel BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib.OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with stage IV melanoma who received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) as part of a clinical trial and developed numerous diffuse, pathology-proven KAs and SCCs. CONCLUSIONS: Given vemurafenib's recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, we provide a timely case report on the effective use of PDT in the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-associated KAs and SCCs. The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has shown up to 78% objective response rates in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation but not in patients lacking the mutation. The oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial. CONTEXT: A polymerase chain reaction-based companion diagnostic (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to select patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma for treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. However, in the recent clinical trial of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response. Vemurafenib (RG7204/PLX4032), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown striking clinical efficacy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, creating the need for a well-validated companion diagnostic to select patients for treatment.BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.Vemurafenib is the first molecularly targeted therapy to be licensed in the US and Europe for treatment of advanced melanomaClinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway", "answers": {"answer_start": [487, 15], "text": ["Vemurafenib", "Dabrafenib"]}}

Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all cell lines. Together, these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.Response patterns of recurrent glioblastomas treated with tumor-treating fields.NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months).NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients.The effect of field strength on glioblastoma multiforme response in patients treated with the NovoTTF\u2122-100A system. An ongoing trial is assessing its efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been FDA-approved for recurrent GBM.We present three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the effects of each adjustment.The first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ.  A second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted accordingly. A phase I/II trial of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy in combination with pemetrexed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Promising preclinical data have led to a single arm phase I/II trial in NSCLC patients.METHODS: Forty-two inoperable stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC patients who had had tumor progression received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) iv q3w together with daily TTFields therapy until disease progression.The median time to in-field progression was 28 weeks and the median time to systemic progression was 22 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TTFields and pemetrexed as a second line therapy for NSCLC is safe and potentially more effective than pemetrexed alone. TTFields improved disease control within the treatment field and a phase III study is planned to further investigate its role as a novel treatment in NSCLC.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe. The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first device, the NovoTTF-100A\u2122, that uses this technology and is indicated for use in progressive glioblastoma multiforme after standard therapies have failed. Promising clinical trial results will likely lead to expanded uses in primary brain tumors and other cancer types. Long-term survival of patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme treated with tumor-treating fields.Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types. Our center was the first to apply TTField treatment to histologically proven GBM in a small pilot study of 20 individuals in 2004 and 2005, and four of those original 20 patients are still alive today. We report two cases of GBM and two cases of RGBM treated by TTField therapy, all in good health and no longer receiving any treatment more than seven years after initiating TTField therapy, with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. Furthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol.The second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TTFields alone and in combination with paclitaxel and doxorubicin effectively reduce the viability of both wild type and MDR cell sub-lines and thus can potentially be used as an effective treatment of drug resistant tumors.Alternating electric fields (TTFields) inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors. This novel treatment modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.BACKGROUND: The present study explores the efficacy and toxicity of combining a new, non-toxic, cancer treatment modality, termed Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), with chemotherapeutic treatment in-vitro, in-vivo and in a pilot clinical trial.In addition, we studied the effects of combining chemotherapy with TTFields in an animal tumor model and in a pilot clinical trial in recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM patients.RESULTS: The efficacy of TTFields-chemotherapy combination in-vitro was found to be additive with a tendency towards synergism for all drugs and cell lines tested (combination indexA pilot study with very low-intensity, intermediate-frequency electric fields in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open, prospective pilot study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of TTFields treatment in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors using the NovoTTF100A(TM) device.Outcomes showed 1 partial response of a treated skin metastasis from a primary breast cancer, 3 cases where tumor growth was arrested during treatment, and 1 case of disease progression. One mesothelioma patient experienced lesion regression near TTFields with simultaneous tumor stability or progression in distal areas.CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients in this study is small, the lack of therapy toxicity and the efficacy observed in data gathered to date indicate the potential of TTFields as a new treatment modality for solid tumors, definitely warranting further investigation.Mitotic disruption and reduced clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by tumor treating fields.OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields).Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types.Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe.Tumor-treating fields (TTField) therapy is a novel treatment technique that has recently received CE and FDA approval for the treatment of RGBM, and is based on the principle that low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields (100 to 300 kHz) may induce apoptosis in specific cell types.

In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDsThe number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil,  potential drug interaction exists between oral corticosteroids and warfarin, but there is limited documentation.Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.We review the possible mechanisms of this interaction and the reported interactions between warfarin and other protease inhibitors.It is necessary to intensify warfarin monitoring upon initiation or alteration of hormonal contraceptives.To report a single patient case that presented with a probable drug interaction between warfarin and 3 methods of hormonal contraceptives, as assessed by the Horn Interaction Probability Scale.Warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults of an outpatient anticoagulation clinicSeveral classes of drugs, such as antibiotics, may interact with warfarin to cause an increase in warfarins anticoagulant activity and the clinical relevance of warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults is not clear.As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug.The most commonly identified potentially interacting medication pairs were warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6824 cases), theophylline/aminophylline and ciprofloxacin/fluvoxamine (930), and warfarin and barbiturates (567).Among 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin, fluconazole, amiodarone, and omeprazole were associated with the requirement for 45.8, 16.7, and 16.7% lower median warfarin dose (all P<0.05 with a false discovery rate <0.05).The results demonstrate a high prevalence of concomitant drug prescriptions with the potential for clinically relevant DDIs with warfarin, the most frequent being acetylsalicylic acid and amiodaroneWe provide new support for the previous scarce evidence of interactions between warfarin and carbamazepine, bezafibrate, and lactulose.

Established protocols for experimental detection and computational inference of CNVs from SNP array and next-generation sequencing data are available. We present the CNVRanger R/Bioconductor package which implements a comprehensive toolbox for structured downstream analysis of CNVs. This includes functionality for summarizing individual CNV calls across a population, assessing overlap with functional genomic regions, and genome-wide association analysis with gene expression and quantitative phenotypes.seqCNA: an R package for DNA copy number analysis in cancer using high-throughput sequencing.We introduce seqCNA, a parallelized R package for an integral copy number analysis of high-throughput sequencing cancer data. The package includes novel methodology on (i) filtering, reducing false positives, and (ii) GC content correction, improving copy number profile quality, especially under great read coverage and high correlation between GC content and copy number. Adequate analysis steps are automatically chosen based on availability of paired-end mapping, matched normal samples and genome annotation.CONCLUSIONS: seqCNA, available through Bioconductor, provides accurate copy number predictions in tumoural data, thanks to the extensive filtering and better GC bias correction, while providing an integrated and parallelized workflow.iGC-an integrated analysis package of gene expression and copy number alteration.With the advancement in high-throughput technologies, researchers can simultaneously investigate gene expression and copy number alteration (CNA) data from individual patients at a lower cost. Traditional analysis methods analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in the same individual.RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two real microarray datasets demonstrated that the CNA-driven genes identified by the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a genomic region with CNA. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC package showed better performance.CONCLUSION: The iGC package is effective and useful for identifying CNA-driven genes. By simultaneously considering both comparative genomic and transcriptomic data, it can provide better understanding of biological and medical questions. The iGC package's source code and manual are freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iGC.htmlPLRS: a flexible tool for the joint analysis of DNA copy number and mRNA expression data. DNA copy number and mRNA expression are commonly used data types in cancer studies. Available software for integrative analysis arbitrarily fixes the parametric form of the association between the two molecular levels and hence offers no opportunities for modelling it. We present a new tool for flexible modelling of this association. PLRS uses a wide class of interpretable models including popular ones and incorporates prior biological knowledge. It is capable to identify the gene-specific type of relationship between gene copy number and mRNA expression. Moreover, it tests the strength of the association and provides confidence intervals. We illustrate PLRS using glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PLRS is implemented as an R package and available from Bioconductor (as of version 2.12; http://bioconductor.org). SomatiCA: identifying, characterizing and quantifying somatic copy number aberrations from cancer genome sequencing data.Whole genome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. However, analysis of somatic copy-number changes from sequencing data is still challenging because of insufficient sequencing coverage, unknown tumor sample purity and subclonal heterogeneity. Here we describe a computational framework, named SomatiCA, which explicitly accounts for tumor purity and subclonality in the analysis of somatic copy-number profiles. Taking read depths (RD) and lesser allele frequencies (LAF) as input, SomatiCA will output 1) admixture rate for each tumor sample, 2) somatic allelic copy-number for each genomic segment, 3) fraction of tumor cells with subclonal change in each somatic copy number aberration (SCNA), and 4) a list of substantial genomic aberration events including gain, loss and LOH. SomatiCA is available as a Bioconductor R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/SomatiCA.html.Copynumber: Efficient algorithms for single- and multi-track copy number segmentation.Cancer progression is associated with genomic instability and an accumulation of gains and losses of DNA. The growing variety of tools for measuring genomic copy numbers, including various types of array-CGH, SNP arrays and high-throughput sequencing, calls for a coherent framework offering unified and consistent handling of single- and multi-track segmentation problems. In addition, there is a demand for highly computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, due to the emergence of very high density scans of copy number.RESULTS: A comprehensive Bioconductor package for copy number analysis is presented. The package offers a unified framework for single sample, multi-sample and multi-track segmentation and is based on statistically sound penalized least squares principles. Conditional on the number of breakpoints, the estimates are optimal in the least squares sense. A novel and computationally highly efficient algorithm is proposed that utilizes vector-based operations in R. Three case studies are presented.CONCLUSIONS: The R package copynumber is a software suite for segmentation of single- and multi-track copy number data using algorithms based on coherent least squares principles.Using the R Package crlmm for Genotyping and Copy Number Estimation.Genotyping platforms such as Affymetrix can be used to assess genotype-phenotype as well as copy number-phenotype associations at millions of markers. While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on HapMap samples, tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss. All analyses are performed in the statistical environment R.KC-SMARTR: An R package for detection of statistically significant aberrations in multi-experiment aCGH data.Most approaches used to find recurrent or differential DNA Copy Number Alterations (CNA) in array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data from groups of tumour samples depend on the discretization of the aCGH data to gain, loss or no-change states. This causes loss of valuable biological information in tumour samples, which are frequently heterogeneous. We have previously developed an algorithm, KC-SMART, that bases its estimate of the magnitude of the CNA at a given genomic location on kernel convolution (Klijn et al., 2008). This accounts for the intensity of the probe signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple samples.RESULTS: Here we extend the approach to allow comparative analyses of two groups of samples and introduce the R implementation of these two approaches. The comparative module allows for a supervised analysis to be performed, to enable the identification of regions that are differentially aberrated between two user-defined classes.We analyzed data from a series of B- and T-cell lymphomas and were able to retrieve all positive control regions (VDJ regions) in addition to a number of new regions. A t-test employing segmented data, that we implemented, was also able to locate all the positive control regions and a number of new regions but these regions were highly fragmented.CONCLUSIONS: KC-SMARTR offers recurrent CNA and class specific CNA detection, at different genomic scales, in a single package without the need for additional segmentation. It is memory efficient and runs on a wide range of machines. Most importantly, it does not rely on data discretization and therefore maximally exploits the biological information in the aCGH data.The program is freely available from the Bioconductor website http://www.bioconductor.org/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License.", "answers": {"answer_start": [0, 779, 2320, 3624, 4156, 5229, 6541, 7617], "text": ["CNVRanger", "seqCNA", "iGC", "PLRS", "SomatiCA", "Copynumber", "crlmm", "KC-SMARTR"]}}

A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial indexThe monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been shown to moderate the impact of maltreatment on antisocial behaviour.Non-linear interactions between the MAOA gene and violence were detected, suggesting that the genetic moderation may come about once a certain level of violence is experiencedThe history of research on the association between platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and personality traits, such as sensation seeking and impulsiveness, is reviewed. Monoamine oxidase a gene is associated with borderline personality disorder.As for its role in aggression, impulsivity, suicide and mood liability, monoamine oxidase A can be considered a functional candidate in borderline personality disorder.These results show that the monoamine oxidase A gene may play an important role in the etiological development of the borderline personality disorder.Gene environment interactions with a novel variable Monoamine Oxidase A transcriptional enhancer are associated with antisocial personality disorder.However, clinical associations between this VNTR genotype and behavioral states have been inconsistent. Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter methylation and transcriptional downregulation in an offender population with antisocial personality disorder.hese results are consistent with prior literature suggesting MAOA and serotonergic dysregulation in antisocial populations. Our results offer the first evidence suggesting epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to MAOA dysregulation in antisocial offenders.For example, it has been shown that childhood maltreatment interacts with a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene variant to predict antisocial behavior that is often associated with alcoholism, and an interaction between early life stress and a serotonin transporter promoter variant predicts alcohol abuse in nonhuman primates and depression in humans.Allelic variation of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been implicated in conduct disorder and antisocial, aggressive behavior in humans when associated with early adverse experiences.By conferring allele-specific transcriptional activity on the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in humans, length variation of a repetitive sequence [(variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR)] in the MAOA promoter influences a constellation of personality traits related to aggressive and antisocial behavior and increases the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.Genotypes with three-repeat alleles were reported to be associated with antisocial as well as impulsive traits.Platelet MAO-B activity has been associated with psychopathy- and aggression-related personality traits, while variants of the MAOA and MAOB genes have been associated with diverse clinical phenotypes, including aggressiveness, antisocial problems and violent delinquency.Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males.CONCLUSION Taken together, these findings suggest that the MAOA-L genotype is to some extent associated with impulsive and antisocial personality traits in alcoholic men.Relationship of monoamine oxidase A binding to adaptive and maladaptive personality traits.Cluster B personality disorders are associated with allelic variation of monoamine oxidase A activity.", "answers": {"answer_start": [102, 437], "text": ["antisocial personality disorder", "borderline personality disorder"]}}

Based on physical principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as a model to account for interstrand loop entropy.exposure status classification of transmembrane beta barrel residuesSeveral computational methods exist for the identification of transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs) from sequence. Some of these methods also provide the transmembrane (TM) boundaries of the putative TMBs.

The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands.A HMM-based method to predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteinsA novel method is developed to model and predict the transmembrane regions of beta-barrel membrane proteins. It is based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with architecture obeying those proteins' construction principles.First, an algorithm that calculates the mean hydrophobicity of one side of putative beta-strands predicted the positions of 16 transmembrane segments, a structure common to known porins.

The specificity and sensitivity of 11 methods were separately evaluated. Our critical assessment shows that some secondary structure prediction methods (PHD, Dsc, Sopma) originally designed to predict globular protein structure are useful on porin topology prediction. The overall best prediction is obtained by combining these three \"generalist\" methods with a transmembrane beta strand prediction techniqueA knowledge-based potential highlights unique features of membrane \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-barrel protein insertion and foldingIn previous work, a depth-dependent insertion potential, E(z) , was derived for \u03b1-helical inner membrane proteins. We have generated an equivalent potential for TM \u03b2-barrel proteins.

In addition, we have found that extended and contiguous weakly stable regions often signal the existence of an oligomer and that strands located in the interfaces of protein-protein interactions are considerably less stable. Based on these observations, we can predict oligomerization states and can identify the interfaces of protein-protein interactions for beta-barrel membrane proteins by using either structure or sequence informationRecently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology.We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane \u03b2-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods.Several computational methods have been developed to discriminate TMBBs from other types of proteins.To conquer this limitation, we developed a new computational model that can be used for predicting the ASA of both TM \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-barrel residues.Transmembrane beta barrel (TMB) proteins are found in the outer membranes of bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.RESULTS: We present here, an HMM that combine a transmembrane barrel submodel and an SP submodel for both topology and SP predictions.Prediction of membrane spanning segments in beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) and their topology is an important problem in structural and functional genomics.In the simplest of these, the target \"model\" is another protein sequence, while the more elaborate methods group together the entire set of t ansmembrane helical or transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.Based on this study, we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane beta-barrel regions in proteins (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred).", "answers": {"answer_start": [6439, 6419, 0, 1102, 10643, 2137, 2143, 13658, 6376, 4885, 6079, 2975, 1543, 10040, 3731], "text": ["BBF", "beta-barrel finder", "BETAWARE", "BOCTOPUS", "BOMP", "BTMX", "Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure", "OMBBpred", "PROFtmb", "PRED-TMBB", "TBBPred", "TMBETAPRED-RBF", "TMBHMM", "TransFold", "TMBpro"]}}
